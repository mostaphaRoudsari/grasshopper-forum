{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI happened to find this fantastic cumulative solar radiation analysis done by Yazdani Studio of CannonDesign. I am wondering how this can be done in Grasshopper. Can anyone share personal experience?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KewsNm4bWJ4xPLltQaK3CWW9efI0gFozX4oHgbBvh*c8Ysdylab9e7gneV14ScnA5uFlspdb5uKCU72HrMjGlnllAWGeVHrG/Cumulativesolarradiationanalysis.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KewsNm4bWJ4xPLltQaK3CWW9efI0gFozX4oHgbBvh*c8Ysdylab9e7gneV14ScnA5uFlspdb5uKCU72HrMjGlnllAWGeVHrG/Cumulativesolarradiationanalysis.jpg)\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Maria X", "created_at": "May 12, 2016 at 2:37am", "created_by": "MariaX", "topic": "Cumulative solar radiation analysis", "replies": [{"body": "\nHey Mary, it is a custom made GH definition that uses analysis data from ecotect and maps it on a custom rad rose.
