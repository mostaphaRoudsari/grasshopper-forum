{"body": "\nHi M. et al... Following the question about evaluating pts for direct radiation at a specific time and location, I have made a file with the simplest definition: Two buildings, one in front of the other,\u00a0 setting the first building as context and getting the pts to evaluate from the other's front facade (i.e. the one facing the sun but obstructed by the other bldg)... the evaluation should give a list of boolean values (120 as the number of pts) it should be pretty simple, but I don't see how to get the result from the SunLightHours component... Thanks, R.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A965483", "name": "evalute_pts.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Rodrigo Velasco", "created_at": "November 28, 2013 at 6:42am", "created_by": "RodrigoVelasco", "topic": "Evaluate points for direct radiation", "replies": [{"body": "\nIt is working now.\n\nOf course Mostapha will say the last word, but you need to input a mesh/brep as Geometry and not Points.\n\nAlso you need to RunIt, give a grid size and a distance from base surface.\n\nIf you search for previous threads Mostapha gave an example for points, but it was really creating a small surface of analysis.

If you are looking for certain points you can mesh the surface beforehand and Ladybug will use center of mesh faces as test points.\n\nThere is also sunIsVisible output that you can use to see if the point can see the sun or not. It will be more useful if you are testing for more than a single vector.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/mx*zwIsB58l8KUW1b7CSmQAQ9wpkES*BR6htF*u24GSM0Xg15taXw4qAhjNCask6VO30QYNL2cPT9cfR2-UN4sjQwSenCPsj/isSunVisible.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/mx*zwIsB58l8KUW1b7CSmQAQ9wpkES*BR6htF*u24GSM0Xg15taXw4qAhjNCask6VO30QYNL2cPT9cfR2-UN4sjQwSenCPsj/isSunVisible.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 28, 2013 at 8:37am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nMany thanks to both!\u00a0 sunIsVisible is the output I was looking for, now I connected a mesh, which I guess means that the component would evaluate its center point, but still is not working for me... gives me 1.
