{"body": "\nHey everyone!\n\n\n\nI was wondering if it is possible to have two temperature setpoint depending on the outside temperature. I couldn't solve it since I cant pass the HBzones output through calculation components.\n\n\n\nHere in the Netherlands there is a requirement for fresh schools, wherby the outside temperature decides the indoor temperature set points.\n\nSo if outdoor temp. is below 10 than the indoor temp. is between 20 - 24 degrees\n\nand if outdoor temp is above 10 than the indoor temp. should be between 23 - 26.\n\n\n\nAttached is a really simplified picture for what i mean.\u00a0\n\nHopefully someone can help and tell me if this is possible.\n\n\n\ngr.

Or cooling?)\n\n\n\nWhat if you have 20C? You need to heat to 24-26?\n\nWhat if you have 28? Then you cool to 24-26?\n\n\n\nSomething is missing here ...\n\nOr am i wrong? (In this case i don't understand the logic).\n\n\n\nBesides that, you are simulating 3 zones instead of 1. Your conncetions of all the HB_setEPZoneSchedules to the HB_setEPIdealAir is causing this.

I know it might sound a bit silly for thermal comfort.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor example in summer (when temp can reach 20 or 28C) the indoor temperature might still be 21C than the room is heated to 23C, but due to internal gains the indoor temp can also reach 28C, than you must obviously cool down to\u00a023-26C.\n\n\n\nSo therfore I need two setpoint on both heating and cooling, where you normally set the range for the whole year or half a year (summer/winter).\n\n\n\nAs can be seen from the figure, the red shows the time when the indoor temperature should be in a range of 23-26, this is where the outside temp is equal or above 10C.\n\n\n\nHope this explaination and examples help to understand the issue.\n\n\n\nGr.
