{"body": "\nIt seems a customized schedule produced by the **Honeybee_Create CSV Schedule** component is not acceptable by the **Honeybee_Add to EP library** component.\n\n\n\nMay I ask how to add a customized schedule to the project library and call it for other use? Otherwise, we may need to manually connect the **csvSchedule** output node on the **Honeybee_Create CSV Schedule** component to other place requesting a schedule.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks![<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-oaic7y9RVRar7dxRhKlvCgEuw7TyFuZUUYGvLnwwoflir1pbEXsFVWEYqBrGJOeZI8yZqjRz3HBIIntkyVLfSpGU0ENCiRA/09.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-oaic7y9RVRar7dxRhKlvCgEuw7TyFuZUUYGvLnwwoflir1pbEXsFVWEYqBrGJOeZI8yZqjRz3HBIIntkyVLfSpGU0ENCiRA/09.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1350368", "name": "schedule.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 28, 2015 at 12:57am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "how to save a customized schedule to the project library?", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\nsee the attached file for your schedule, this definition shows how I usually create an Energy Plus schedule.\n\nHope this helps.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1350376", "name": "mylightingschedule1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Jacopo Sartore", "created_at": "August 28, 2015 at 1:58am", "created_by": "JacopoSartore", "replies": [{"body": "\nthank you, Jacopo!\n\n\n\nI see that in your example you're defining schedule in exactly the **IDF** format so that it can be added to the EP library.\n\n\n\nHowever, I still want to know if there is a way to add a schedule customized in the \"brute force\" way of using the **Create CSV Schedule** component.\n\n\n\nAdvice is greatly appreciated!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 29, 2015 at 12:53am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Grsshope, Since it's already saved as .csv file you can use the filepath itself.
