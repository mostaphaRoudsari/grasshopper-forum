{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nAfter generating glazing using the \"Honeybee_Glazing based on ratio\" component, I'm trying to pare down the number of glazing objects that are created.

I started poking through the honeybee code. It looks like the child surfs are indexed? (Based on seeing \"surfaces.childsrfs[]\" and something about a \"basechildsrf\").\n\n\n\nSo presumably one could set surfaces.childsrfs[n] = null or something like that based on an array fed to a function input. Perhaps I'll take a stab at it at some point (if you don't beat me to it).\n\n\n\nBut for now I think that answers my question. this all started because I wanted to clean up the geometry I fed into e+. But since I'm not using e+'s geometry-sensitive internal radiation distribution models, I believe the glazing apertures get combined in pre-processing anyway, and don't slow the simulation down.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for the consult!
