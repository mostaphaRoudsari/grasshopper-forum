Studying .epw files with IWEC and IWEC2 formatting side by side, I can't see that there are any imidiate differences in the structure of the file. (Perhaps this is a question for Mostapha?) It seems strange that HB only recognizes IWEC since IWEC2 is the official version sold by ASHRAE.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "\u00d6rn Erlendsson", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 7:39am", "created_by": "OErnErlendsson", "replies": []}]}]}
