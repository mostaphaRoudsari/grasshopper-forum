{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI ran a big Eplus model (50 zones, ~1000 windows) and it crashed grasshopper when it tried to read the results file. See image below. I was trying to read zone results and energy flow data from each window surface at the same time. It appears that this is too much for my computer. Can anyone think of a way that I can get around this? Gathering 8760 data for each window surface really bumps up the data being brought in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt would be great if the \"read results\"\u00a0modules allowed us to select individual zones rather than bringing in all data. Is there a\u00a0way to\u00a0do this? I tried to bring in only those columns of data that I want directly from the\u00a0csv file but there is too much data. I have no idea what columns to choose based on my\u00a0zone/ window surface choice.\u00a0Any ideas? I'm open to any suggestions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/kZzo8PgK6ncymq0aHILSwvsyUHSjIbjAbvdzWpCOb4gDWVP*tVupUuweviEWTaDJmAyEYJ-wz3TS0n*s91SYx1bdUuHw1wkW/GHcrash.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/kZzo8PgK6ncymq0aHILSwvsyUHSjIbjAbvdzWpCOb4gDWVP*tVupUuweviEWTaDJmAyEYJ-wz3TS0n*s91SYx1bdUuHw1wkW/GHcrash.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "June 25, 2015 at 3:11pm", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "topic": "Honeybee EPlus crash: Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException'", "replies": [{"body": "\nI agree. We should have sort of query based results reader. It will be probably the best to do it through sql and not the csv file. I'm pretty sure we discussed this before and I think it's important to implement it at some point soon. There is a WIP component for read .sql results but I'm not sure how useful it is at this point of time.\n\n\n\nI'm also not sure if there is any other tool that can handle this amount of data and visualizes the results. Have you tried OpenStudio?\n\n\n\nThe only solution I can think of right now is to write a custom code to parse the results from the csv file which will probably take a considerable amount of time.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 27, 2015 at 1:17pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nLeland and Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThere are definitely some simple ways around this (I was making models that were as many as 70 zones for my thesis) and there are some more complex ones if you really need a specific slice of the data.\n\nFirst things that I can recommend: if you can run the simulation for just an analysis period that you are interested in, this can really cut down the parsing time and memory a lot. \u00a0Try running the simulation for a typical or extreme hot/cold week to see if you can test the thing you are interested in this way. \u00a0This was primarily how I got around the issue for my thesis and I can say that the comfort map workflow allows you to scroll through the data any way you like even when it is not an annual simulation (in the past, it needed to be an annual sim to use the analysisPeriod input). \u00a0I just implemented this feature on the color zones and color surfaces components ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/519823b5a3a9c85...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/519823b5a3a9c85b449733268dbf07dd65ee245e)).\n\nSecond, if you can curate the outputs that you are interested in from the \"simulationOutputs\" of the \"Generate EP Output\" component, this will also cut down on the amount of data you are bringing in through the result reader. \u00a0Obviously, cutting out surface outputs cuts down the amount of imported data way more than zone outputs.\n\nThird, if you can accept not bringing in hourly results but just monthly or total results for some of the outputs, this also cuts down on the data substantially.\n\nForth, as a last-ditch effort you can always connect up just the zones that you are interested in to the Run Simulation component and put adiabatic surfaces for the adjacencent surfaces. \u00a0I know that this is not ideal from a simulation accuracy perspective but it is clearly better than no results at all. \u00a0I recently updated the \"Make Adiabatic by Type\" component to allow you to make any type of surface adiabatic and this should help with setting such cases up ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/1b5329ca61d9547...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/1b5329ca61d95473d8371c5b82c72f630503c862)).\n\n\n\nTo be clear about the sql option: I agree that this is the best way to deal with the huge data sets we get out of E+ and I have been wanting to develop this ability into the Run Simulation workflow for a while. \u00a0However, I have been unable to move forward because the parsing of the sql file relies on the openStudio parser (asking people to download a separate sqlLite parser and writing corresponding code for it seems to just be too much work). I experience the OpenStudio PINVOKE error on my system and so this has halted my ability to develop such a workflow.\n\n\n\nWith a few hours, I can write the ability into the Read EP Result component to only bring in data for a HBZones input that I can add. \u00a0I have been questioning whether this would be worth it because I was still holding out hope that the PINVOKE error would be solved. \u00a0Mostapha, could you let me know what time frame you think it would take to fix the PINVOKE error? \u00a0Knowing that will help me decide whether it's worth it to invest in an input on the current result reader. \u00a0Also, let me know if there are any ways that I might help or I might begin researching a solution.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 30, 2015 at 10:50pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nChris and Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for your advice. In this case I went\u00a0with Chris' fourth option and ran individual zones, but I'll be looking at the other methods of reducing output data before I run\u00a0my next\u00a0large model. Good luck with\u00a0fixing the\u00a0Open Studio bug, the sql\u00a0option sounds promising.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "July 1, 2015 at 7:56am", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "replies": []}]}]}
