{"body": "\nHello All,\n\nI am having issues running the energy analysis with blinds. I have tried to use the regular output (HBObjWShades) or the shades breps\u00a0as context. In both cases, the energy analysis doesn't run. When I run the analysis using the\u00a0HBObjWShades output, I get two errors, showed in the attached picture (UsingOutput). On the\u00a0other hand, when I try to use the shdesbrep\u00a0output as context for the analysis, it gives me the error in the attached image (UsingContext). I have no idea how to fix these issues, I have tried to generate my own shade material based on Energy Plus documentation.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for the help in Advance,\u00a0\n\n\n\nJP\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1573955", "name": "EnergyAnalysisMultipleZones2.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1573956", "name": "UsingOutput.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1573957", "name": "UsingContext.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Joao Pedro Carneiro", "created_at": "July 31, 2016 at 3:13pm", "created_by": "JoaoPedroCarneiro", "topic": "Blinds Issue", "replies": [{"body": "\nJoao,\n\nIt seems that the default auto-calculation of the distance from the blinds center plane to the glass was resulting in the blinds being closer to the glass than E+ likes. \u00a0It was only affecting cases where you have angled shades and the component is doing trigonometry to figure out how close the blinds could be to the glass without touching. \u00a0I just re-wrote the code so that, now you cannot have the blinds closer to the glass than half of the blind slat depth, which seems to be the limit of what E+ will tolerate.\n\nAlso, E+ does not like it when you input blinds that are perfectly at 90 degrees so I changed the component to automatically write out shades at 89 degrees when you connect up 90.\n\nUsing the Shade geometry as context worked perfectly for me and I am not sure what was wrong in your situation.\n\nSee your working file attached.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1574651", "name": "EnergyAnalysisMultipleZones2_CWM2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 1, 2016 at 3:35pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks, Chris.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest\n\nJP\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Joao Pedro Carneiro", "created_at": "August 2, 2016 at 12:38pm", "created_by": "JoaoPedroCarneiro", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1573958"}
