If you convert it to KWh/2 it will be 0.0744 which is equal to 0.1 if you round the number. What do you expect the result to be?\n\nAlso two points to keep in mind:\n\n1. As you already mentioned weather files are not the same.\n\n2. Vasari's results is not validated so if you want to compare the results I suggest you to compare Ladybug's result to Honeybee (RADIANCE).
