{"body": "\nHey guys,\n\n\n\nI have a problem with ladybug capture view component. I cannot figure out the problem. I am trying to get a point in time daylight simulation for 9 different times of the year and I have set it to\u00a0automatically capture view in my drive C after each simulation, but I am not getting any result. The captured views in my file does not show recolormesh visualization. It is just the plan. I don't know what it is that I am doing wrong. I have checked many times and nothing seems wrong.\n\nWhen I do this simulation one by one I get the result on my rhino interface and I can capture and print that myself. But the capture view component does not work for me. And the problem is I am not getting any error so I can realize my problem. It is just not captured properly with recolormesh component. I have attached related images so you can better understand my problem. I will appreciate your help if you can tell what might be the problem. Looking forward for your response.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1628381", "name": "my rhino interface plan.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1628382", "name": "the captured file.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1628383", "name": "my grasshopper image capture part.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Mitra Sajjadi", "created_at": "October 28, 2016 at 9:27pm", "created_by": "MitraSajjadi", "topic": "problem with ladybug capture view component", "replies": [{"body": "\nTry 'Top' instead of 'top'.

I have tried both of them. The problem is that this component does not capture the recolormesh result. It just captures the plan without any simulation results when I set it to automatically save 9 images. So I have to do it one by one and it will be so time consuming. If you can help me find the problem with my file it will be awesome and I will really appreciate that. Thank you so much.\n\n\n\nLooking forward for your response.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mitra Sajjadi", "created_at": "October 28, 2016 at 10:01pm", "created_by": "MitraSajjadi", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nIt happens because of the order of the execution in Grasshopper.
