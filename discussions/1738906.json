{"body": "\nHello,\n\nQuick question:\n\nPer image attached, what is wrong with the output colors appearance?\u00a0\n\nI am new (very new \u2014first post) to GH &amp; LB, already in love though...so thank you all for your hard work on these amazing tools!\n\nIn more words, for some reason the image generated is producing a textured surface and gradient. Grid is set to 4 (meters) so it should not be the reason, any idea...perhaps something in rhino options I need to change...I am not sure.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBig Thanks!![<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/PyPlrJLAwZdiCVnoGqNpmpmsIYvHutI6Xxkgdx9F3PovW4UausLSrbeCOrVDBnqOhAtSkJCFVdcSDkAhvMC2K16Fz7jMZgEV/sunlighthours.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/PyPlrJLAwZdiCVnoGqNpmpmsIYvHutI6Xxkgdx9F3PovW4UausLSrbeCOrVDBnqOhAtSkJCFVdcSDkAhvMC2K16Fz7jMZgEV/sunlighthours.JPG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nat Valdes", "created_at": "April 24, 2017 at 12:20pm", "created_by": "NatValdes", "topic": "Sunlight analysis output appearance", "replies": [{"body": "\nHide the Rhino geometry and/or the base geometry in GH.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 24, 2017 at 3:43pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nAbraham Thanks.\u00a0\n\nI hid the geometry, problem remains.\n\nI does look as if multiple surfaces were plotted...\n\nugh???\n\nWill continue working on data generation for now, and research meanwhile what the problem here is...\n\nThanks again!\n\nN\u2014[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vvHEZw33BGpdqrT7A16QNAVh0BjhEi*2VfsSCdPIWOMDqsRRt7nmpmKH21O5tluAufypOce0hNxEr-DCb*ZsZLxN7YQsOYb8/sunlighthours2.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vvHEZw33BGpdqrT7A16QNAVh0BjhEi*2VfsSCdPIWOMDqsRRt7nmpmKH21O5tluAufypOce0hNxEr-DCb*ZsZLxN7YQsOYb8/sunlighthours2.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nat Valdes", "created_at": "April 24, 2017 at 7:59pm", "created_by": "NatValdes", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nFor sure you are showing at the same time the analysis results and the geometry, either in Rhino or in GH. 100%\n\nHide the results and you'll see.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 24, 2017 at 10:18pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nYou got it.\u00a0\n\nBoth Rhino+GH, needed to be hidden.\n\nDid not get this in the tutorials.\n\nBIG Thanks!\n\nN\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nat Valdes", "created_at": "April 25, 2017 at 8:48am", "created_by": "NatValdes", "replies": []}]}]}
