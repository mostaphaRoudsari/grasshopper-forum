{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\n\n\nNew to Ladybug + Honeybee. Was hoping to get some info to better understand what radiation calla lilies represent. I understand that they show radiation for the specified period of time and I understand the gradient. But what do the peaks and valleys represent in 3D? Why is there a hole in the middle? What relation does it have to its circular form?\n\n\n\nThanks for all your help!\n\n\n\n\n\nScott\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Scott Carncross", "created_at": "October 25, 2015 at 4:08pm", "created_by": "ScottCarncross", "topic": "Radiation Calla Lilies", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Scott,\n\nLook at the hint of the component. I'm sure you'll get a better idea what is shown in the plot.\n\nBasically it shows all possible directions and orientations and the amount of radiation you get on them. Is cool!!\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 25, 2015 at 4:50pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Abraham!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Scott Carncross", "created_at": "October 28, 2015 at 5:29pm", "created_by": "ScottCarncross", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nUpdating the link as the old one doesn't work anymore:\u00a0[https://mostapharoudsari.gitbooks.io/ladybug-primer/content/text/co...](https://mostapharoudsari.gitbooks.io/ladybug-primer/content/text/components/Radiation_Calla_Lily.html)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 28, 2015 at 6:59pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1385936"}
