{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI am getting an error with the selectSkyMtx component when inputting large arrays of HOY inputs. See attached file.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe error says \"**1. Solution exception:unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'str' and 'int'**\".\n\nIt occurs on lines 42 and 141, where the HOY seems to be calculated and called. The error only appears when I have at least 1000 HOY\u00a0inputs or so. The data seems to be good, but I can't reasonably check every data set to be sure. I would feel more comfotable if I knew what was causing the error. I just can't figure this one out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy goal is to combine many hourly sky domes into a single cumulative dome that\u00a0responds to\u00a0complex occupancy schedules or heating/cooling\u00a0schedules. The analysis period does not\u00a0allow this level of refinement.\u00a0Is there a better way to accomplish\u00a0what I want\u00a0using standard Ladybug components?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you in advance for your help.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A974983", "name": "Ladybug test.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A974984", "name": "USA_MO_St.Louis-Lambert.Intl.AP.724340_TMY3.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "December 17, 2013 at 2:58pm", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "topic": "selectSkyMtx HOY error", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Leland,\n\n\n\nGood to see you here. This is a minor known bug that I actually forget to fix. Thank you for reporting it.\n\n\n\nThe problem happens only for the last hour of year. Checked the attached file for the fixed version. Replace the new Ladybug from the file from what you have in your computer.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bquVoc42xDO0BUzgsjVV1qp8MQE6U49tDe3rkFjPd54pwywNgn8S1YnAXeISrcXrwHQ0sEtEarC587KuYQF1lV17lLeNoqpH/Leland_HOY_bug.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bquVoc42xDO0BUzgsjVV1qp8MQE6U49tDe3rkFjPd54pwywNgn8S1YnAXeISrcXrwHQ0sEtEarC587KuYQF1lV17lLeNoqpH/Leland_HOY_bug.png)\n\n\n\nYou can use separateData component to separate the numbers from the headings of the lists add all the numbers (for all the skies) together and then use one of the sky headers to create a valid Ladybug list. You can use that list (which is your custom sky) for your analysis. Very interesting to see advanced uses of Ladybug like this.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A975163", "name": "Leland_HOY_bug.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 17, 2013 at 5:55pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nP.S.
