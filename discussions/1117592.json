The plugin also provides further support for designers as they test their initial design options with radiation, sunlight-hour, and shading analyses. Integration with Grasshopper allows for an almost instantaneous feedback and, since the plugin runs within the design environment, the information and analyses are interactive.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHoneybee connects Grasshopper3D to EnergyPlus, Radiance, Daysim and OpenStudio for building energy and daylighting simulation. \u00a0The Honeybee project intends to make many of the features of these simulation tools available in a parametric way. \u00a0Just as users have made changes to geometry for years in Grasshopper, now users can parameterize system types, zoning schemes, schedules of operation, daylight sensor placement and controls - \u00a0all of the \u201chardcore\u201d simulation parameters that have never been exposed to parametric modeling tools.\n\n<br/> [https://www.facebook.com/LadyBugforGrasshopper](https://www.facebook.com/LadyBugforGrasshopper)<br/> [http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug)\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 18, 2014 at 12:16am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "topic": "Ladybug and Honeybee Presentation at IBPSA-USA New York Regional Chapter", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi thanks for inviting us,\u00a0\n\nSound very interesting,\n\nin Europe, it will be quite late (00:30-2:00 Berlin time) but will try not to miss this event!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Michal Dengusiak", "created_at": "August 18, 2014 at 1:51am", "created_by": "MichalDengusiak", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you very much!\n\nGreat stuff and many new features!\n\nButterfly looks really nice.
