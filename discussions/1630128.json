{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI downloaded the example file for \"integrated day lighting and Energy simulation\" example file, but it does not work unfortunately. The weather file works, the geometry is read (it is the box in the example file) but no annual .ill results are generated from annual daylighting simulation. The error says: \"Can't find the results for the study\". Would you please take a look at my file and tell me what I am doing wrong. I truly appreciate your help.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nLadan\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1630125", "name": "Integrated_DLE.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1630126", "name": "Box2.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1630127", "name": "DaylightAnalysis.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 1, 2016 at 9:24am", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "Problem with Integrated Daylighting and Energy Simulation Example File", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ladan,\n\n1. Do you have Daysim installed correctly?\n\n2. What happens if you set the north to 0 degrees?

I changed north to 0 and it didn't help. I downloaded daysim from the link provided in your instructions and I think that it is installed correctly (C\\Daysim) please see the attached image.
