{"body": "\nHello people,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if someone can give me some advice on the following.\n\n\n\nI am planning to do an outdoor thermal comfort assessment.\n\n\n\nI will be using CFD simulations to get average velocities in specific points in the geometry. I would then want to input the different average velocities I calculate for all the different points to the outdoor comfort tools and workflow recently designed and updated in HB/LB. Would such a thing be possible and how could I (if I could) couple it with the high resolution comfort maps from Chris's research?\n\n\n\nThank you so much in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 2, 2016 at 10:23pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Outdoor thermal comfort and Microclimate Maps", "replies": [{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nAs with most feats of software, what you ask is possible but the depth and precision to which you need the results to answer your question will determine whether it is worth the time investment. \u00a0If you could find a way to import CFD results into Rhino and get approximate values for wind speed at the test points of the microclimate maps, you would have basically all that you need for such comfort studies.\n\nIf you really want to see the effect of wind on outdoor comfort, though, you should probably be using a [PET version of the comfort maps](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/442). \u00a0Djorde Spasic recently added PET to the Ladybug ComfortModels class and he points out why PET is a better metric for evaluating the effect of wind on outdoor comfort in this github issue:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/217](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/217)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 3, 2016 at 1:58pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}], "id": "1453549"}
