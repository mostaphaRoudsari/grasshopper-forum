{"body": "\nHi\u00a0guys,\n\nI am learning to use honeybee\u00a0by following Chris' youtube tutorial videos (they are very wonderful tutorials, thank you Chris!). When I trying to run energy simulation on honeybee, weird things happens:\n\n1. the readEPResult\u00a0component works, but there are **no outputs on cooling, thermal loads and thermal load balance data**. From the tutorial video i guess these data should be in outputs;\n\n2. and there are\u00a0**no html report** created in RunEnergySimulation Component;\n\n3.\u00a0the readEPSrfResult\u00a0component didn't work and the error is as follows:\n\n\" Your simulation probably did not run correctly. <br/> Check the report out of the Run Simulation component to see what severe or fatal errors happened in the simulation. <br/> If there are no severe or fatal errors, the issue could just be that there is .eio file adjacent to the .csv _resultFileAddress. <br/> Check the folder of the file address you are plugging into this component and make sure that there is both a .csv and .eio file in the folder. \"\n\nI look into the\u00a0folder\u00a0and I sure the .csv and .eio file are there.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/sGlP6-ZcEYDLRPDynjdnIKqpupDenbopRsdy1B*j*J6wdCjRMYVIWy6PZbUbqYZJkDWLNrTAum280jpnH5Yk3YXvwtYuN5MN/QQ20170428014151.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/sGlP6-ZcEYDLRPDynjdnIKqpupDenbopRsdy1B*j*J6wdCjRMYVIWy6PZbUbqYZJkDWLNrTAum280jpnH5Yk3YXvwtYuN5MN/QQ20170428014151.jpg)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/sGlP6-ZcEYDn7D1XIdRy6DZ0ERC0FpsiJ-V7POt0qm9M0XS*H4Qum4P-KIP0d5MtqUXyywOIEuZsdKAAUNamdLzwsvRT4gRU/6.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/sGlP6-ZcEYDn7D1XIdRy6DZ0ERC0FpsiJ-V7POt0qm9M0XS*H4Qum4P-KIP0d5MtqUXyywOIEuZsdKAAUNamdLzwsvRT4gRU/6.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/sGlP6-ZcEYAt2uM3hI7k5Z3WAnosISDjuWGA61iXBmo8OoiLA3gwfkCU77JyPVw2mCG-iFNcE9YG0WFM0F*EVpKEcOVrBuN9/QQ20170428014312.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/sGlP6-ZcEYAt2uM3hI7k5Z3WAnosISDjuWGA61iXBmo8OoiLA3gwfkCU77JyPVw2mCG-iFNcE9YG0WFM0F*EVpKEcOVrBuN9/QQ20170428014312.jpg)\n\nI think got everything the latest version, so i wonder what is wrong?\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\nGUO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1742277", "name": "test-1.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1742278", "name": "test-1.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1742279", "name": "CHN_Guangdong_Guangzhou.592870_CSWD.epw"}], "created_by_name": "GUO.X", "created_at": "April 28, 2017 at 9:57am", "created_by": "GUOX", "topic": "Honeybee energy simulation error", "replies": [{"body": "\nIs it a similar issue to this one?\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/cooling-loa...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/cooling-loads-result-is-missing-after-update-lb-hb)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 29, 2017 at 7:14am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks for your reply, Mostapha! yes, it seems quite similar to my first problem.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "GUO.X", "created_at": "April 29, 2017 at 7:46am", "created_by": "GUOX", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThere is a discussion here: [https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee/issues/132](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee/issues/132)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 29, 2017 at 7:50am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nah, ok, I will wait for the updated version.\n\nBtw, may I know if you have any suggestions about the problem 2 &amp; 3?
