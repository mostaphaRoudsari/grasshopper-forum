After that the software is quite straightforward. In the glazing system tab, you select the number of layers, type of glass (out of thousands in the available library), type of gap, etc.\n\n\n\nOnce you are done you just press the Calculate button and the file is produced. Using the available Honeybee component you can import it into your model.\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to assign your glass properties manually in Honeybee. That method is a bit more difficult because you would need detailed info. You can find that perhaps from the supplier (rarely the have reflectances though) or, again, you can extract it from LBNL Windows (bypassing in a way the creation of the xml file).\n\nI am not aware if there is any impact on the results between the actual xml file and using values (as it would be the case I guess when using no mass wall materials in E+). Perhaps someone more experienced can answer that one.\n\n\n\nHope this is helpful. Good luck!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "November 29, 2015 at 5:36am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nthank you Theodore,so i have to create my material with honeybee radiance BSDF material. i hope it will work.thanks again.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iman Khayat", "created_at": "November 29, 2015 at 5:54am", "created_by": "ImanKhayat", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nAlso check this discussion on unmethours.com:\u00a0[https://unmethours.com/question/1037/converting-transmittance-to-tr...](https://unmethours.com/question/1037/converting-transmittance-to-transmissivity-for-igus/)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 29, 2015 at 7:24am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nVery interesting discussion Mostapha thanks!\n\n\n\nI have a question. Is the BDSF file of Windows representing multiple layers correctly? (I'm guessing but to be sure). Or is this need for actual multiple layers a geometric need?
