In this case the host should be the same walls taht you want to be windows and that can't be. Also the size of the child window should not be the same as the host (E+ constrain).\n\nThat's why i think that giving just the name is not good enough.\n\nThough, now that you mention this, a nice trick can be to give the name, the duplicate is and scale it by some amount (less than 0.95) making the whole process transparent for the user. But as long as i write this, sounds a bit complicated (and confusing).\n\nMakes sense for you?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 10, 2015 at 2:22am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nAs i was thinking the name should say it itself, childSurfacesName is an optional input for naming the new child surfaces.
