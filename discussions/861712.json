This is quite a limitation because for many minor locations it doesn't exist. If I understand correctly this will be not a problem anymore with Honeybee right? (because it uses EnergyPlus I understood,\u00a0like Diva). When you think you will release Honeybee? Thank you for the work you are doing.\n\n\n\nBest regards.\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "May 30, 2013 at 4:40am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Francesco!\n\nGood to know that it works now. You don't need to download .ddy and .stat files for GenCumulativeSky. The folder also shouldn't cause any problem since the component checks and downloads GenCumulativeSky to workingDir in case it is not already there.\n\nI agree that it is hard to find .epw file (EnergyPlus Weather file) for many locations. There are websites that you can purchase the weather files for many locations and there are software that generate the data. They may be open to share the data for free for educational purposes.\n\nNevertheless EnergyPlus and Radiance or any interface such as DIVA, OpenStudio, etc on top of these engines need some sort of data to calculate the sky condition and the radiation. Honeybee won't be any different!\n\nI'm so bad in predicting the release time so let me not to do that! :) The only thing that I can say is I'm doing my best to release a test version as soon as possible. I've already solved almost all the technical issues but the workflow is not solid enough for a public release.\u00a0Thank you for your interest and your patient. :)\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 31, 2013 at 11:37am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nok then probably was some other reason the previous issue.\n\nDon't worry no need to make predictions for the Honeybee release, it was just to have an idea :) So with Honeybee the installer will set EnergyPlus and Radiance as well? (Like DIVA) About use the epw files the interesting thing is that you can work out analysis in realtime, that's very good.\n\nI appreciate a lot the the LadyBug's direct sunlight hour calculation component. It is the first, at least in my experience, between the different environmantal analysis tools for GH that does this straight and easily. So far I used to calculate with with a whole definition I built.\n\nAbout websites for epw files I usually visit this\u00a0[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_about...](http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_about.cfm?CFID=978762&amp;CFTOKEN=93446a83f0be39a4-FF443C22-00F2-ECA9-6896C874CAA44242)\n\nthere are others? What tool you suggest to create weather files? Even if I imagine they should not bee very easy to use.

I really like the idea to let the users know what is really happening in the background. I believe the more you know about the workflow the smarter you'll use the tool.\n\nThank you for the comment.
