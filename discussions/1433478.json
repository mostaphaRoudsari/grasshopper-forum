{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n<br/>When does the .bat file created by the honeybee component get executed? When I try to run the HDR to GIF component directly from grasshopper it never works, but if I run the .bat file manually from my computer, it works just fine -it creates the .gif file and I can preview it through embryo by copying the file path directly.\n\n<br/>The same exact thing is true about the component that creates the .irr file. if I double click the .bat file it works, otherwise, honeybee never creates the .irr file.\n\n\n\nGH file attached.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1433477", "name": "steve.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Helena Zambrano", "created_at": "January 7, 2016 at 3:29pm", "created_by": "HelenaZambrano", "topic": "HDR to GIF component", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Helena,\n\nThe execution happens as soon as you connect the image path to the component. The issue that you're mentioning is almost always because of the permission issues in Windows. When it runs from inside the component it doesn't have the same privilege as when you double click on the batch file.\n\nCan you try the attached file? I changed the way the component executes the batch file. Let's see if this will make any difference.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1433669", "name": "steve_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 7, 2016 at 5:37pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you Mostapha!
