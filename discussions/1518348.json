{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI am doing DA analysis regarding multiple surfaces but the mesh results turned out to be that \" Length of the results [X] is not equal to the number of mesh faces [Y]\". I tried to flatten the mesh list and join them together. But it still had the same problem.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCan anyone help?\n\n\n\nThanks very much in advance!!!!!!\n\n\n\nAttached the gh..
