component for the [revised version of Ladybug](https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/ladybug). \u00a0I'll also mention that Abraham has a bioclimatic chart in WIP, which really should be a part of the main components. \u00a0It's essentially the last chart with the axes flipped (although it is not yet using the PMV model to generate the comfort polygon and using rules of thumb at the moment).\n\nI have been thinking about how an operative temperature plot would work. \u00a0I have to ask Tyler Hoyt how he deals with cases in the CBE tool where (because the air can be warmer than the MRT), you would get values that are above the saturation line. \u00a0If you have an explanation for this, Francesco, please share.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris

without increasing the radiant temperature, the red dot would fall off of the psych chart (it would essentially be above the saturation line).\u00a0 This is because the warm, 100% humid air can hold more water vapor than air than 100% humid air at the cooler operative temperature.\u00a0 Does that make snese?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at":

(**tmr**)\u00a0(it considers only the operative temperature, **to**, as an input) you can consider **ta**, **tmr** and the air velocity (**v**).\n\nIf there are all the data (**ta**, **tmr** and **v**) you can consider [this equation](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/539bc972a7511417cfb8feaf8e7c652fa279a28d).\n\nIf there are not the **v** values you can approximate **to** with [this equation](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/53f66c8a85b23ef049a5ff3f15000dc7b41d2229).\n\nIn the psychrometric chart component you can modify the \u201cmollierHX\u201d input and transform it from a Boolean input value to a numerical input and name it, for example, \u201cchart type\u201d: you can set 0 for\u00a0 the classic chart, 1 for the mollier HX plot, 2 for a (to,x) chart and 3 for a (t, RH) plot.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\"
