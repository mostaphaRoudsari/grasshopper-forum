{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI am about to run a parametric study with around 1800 states. For each of those states several building performance parameters will be calculated (mainly daylight metrics within the buildings and outdoor comofort and shade in the outdoors).\n\n\n\nI mean to use pollination in order to quickly sort through the results afterward. However, I have never used it before and I was wondering if there is an example definition laying around. It would be very helpful into getting me started.\n\n\n\nAnother thing I was wondering about is structuring the results. My main parameters in the study are angles of orientation for either the total massing or the individual rotation angles for the buildings. Would it be possible to structure the results in a way that you can browse through all results of individual rotation angles for one of the available massing orientation angles (see below)? Is that a matter of proper structuring my parameters before I link them to Pollination? Or is that already handled by simply linking my parameters in?\n\n\n\ne.g.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Building 1 angle: 5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Building 2 angle: 0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Building 1 angle: 10\u00a0 Building 2 angle: 0\n\n\u00a0Orientation angle: 45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Building 1 angle: 15\u00a0 Building 2 angle: 0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Building 1 angle: 20\u00a0 Building 2 angle: 0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 etc.\n\n\n\nThanks a lot in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 25, 2016 at 7:48pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Pollination for HB/LB", "replies": [{"body": "\nPlease disregard the above.

The trick was to bring all the values (even the name of the variables in data recorders) and to use text split to update the values used at each iteration.\n\n\n\nI'm currently running a simulation so I cannot clean up my file but you should be able to discern how it works. Special attention to the pollination part (bottom right) and also the text split component (which is crucial in making slider values into iterative parameters) right by the slider section on the left.\n\n\n\nFor anyone interested, what it does is calculate the vertical sky cover of an urban canyon by rotating it around the y axis (what I call massing orientation) and also rotating each of the buildings individually (left or right building rotation). The massing rotation interval is 15 degrees and the building interval is 5 degrees, with a maximum of 40. This gives 1944 possible configurations which are further reduced by assigning a minimum distance between the two buildings of 6m. The check of that distance is a boolean (true or false) and acts as the toggle that starts the simulation. Finally, the simulation is of vertical sky cover which is the fastest one for testing and fits my needs.\n\n\n\nP.S.: I realize calculating VSC of this configuration for all 360 degrees doesn't make much sense but it's the ability of the definition to test this atm that matters and not the results.\n\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1447781", "name": "TG_UrbanCanyon.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 7:46pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Theodoros,\n\n\n\nThank you, I'll have a look through and see if I have any further questions.\n\n\n\nYour project sounds very interesting though, reminds me of a Master's thesis finished last year which worked with orientations, daylight penetration and the minimum amount of distance required between buildings for effect daylight penetration (Tavis Creswell-Wells' \"Urban Form and Passive Design for High Performance Buildings in the Christchurch Rebuild\" if you're curious)\n\nKind Regards\n\nElly\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 7:53pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Elly,\n\n\n\nThanks for the reference, I'll check it out!
