{"body": "\nHello forum,\n\nWhen I work with Skydome component I can't but notice the irregularities in the patches, especially when using Reinhart model. For example (image), in the middle of sunny July there are suddenly some blue patches (low solar radiation). I understand it as the day being cloudy or rainy (for several days even), since single patch displays a a number of days, there are sometimes, occasionally, cloudy days that just happen to appear on one patch, thus such irregularity.\n\n\n\nSince data is collected throughout the decades on a physical equipment, there is no way sky dome can show sunny days during the whole year (unless it is in Sahara or somewhere)\n\n\n\nThese are, of course, just guesses, I would like to hear some knowledgeable opinion on topic to be super sure.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ls0m4bJ0x4flXy62S1hcdkzmpWPGf79XcaaOc-*TehjLtjbo*ceDbjPCXxrc9iKIieGl6mj-37UvA-kBdJRaiUpye7YwDrKi/SkyDome.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ls0m4bJ0x4flXy62S1hcdkzmpWPGf79XcaaOc-*TehjLtjbo*ceDbjPCXxrc9iKIieGl6mj-37UvA-kBdJRaiUpye7YwDrKi/SkyDome.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 7:28am", "created_by": "Timur582", "topic": "About SkyDome Visualization", "replies": [{"body": "\nTim,\n\nWhat you are running up against here is the resolution of sky patches for the Reinhart sky being finer than the hourly resolution of sun positions.\u00a0 You can find a full account of this type of issue on this discussion:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/cumulatives...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/cumulativeskymtx-error-1?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1163776&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 10:39am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nOne minor comment.

The one that you're showing up there is a cloudy hour and sky is pretty diffuse.\n\nI made a gif file that I hope for better understanding of the cumulative sky. I generated the sky for 20 July in Chicago between 7 am and 5 pm. On the left you see the sky for each hour and you can see how the radiation values of the sky are assigned to sky patches for each hour. On the right you can see how cumulative sky gets built based on values for each hour for a single day.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/d70k96K0o0kpAforfvIFvNxmlPooylRiMrdFiIrR1sZbyW7NHKTNsjUDzOsj6-lB6ePBW8RFRP08q6huy3bJGPwXJxza7K-g/output_znZoAX.gif?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/d70k96K0o0kpAforfvIFvNxmlPooylRiMrdFiIrR1sZbyW7NHKTNsjUDzOsj6-lB6ePBW8RFRP08q6huy3bJGPwXJxza7K-g/output_znZoAX.gif)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 23, 2015 at 7:34pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nclick on the image to see the animation\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/d70k96K0o0kpAforfvIFvNxmlPooylRiMrdFiIrR1sZbyW7NHKTNsjUDzOsj6-lB6ePBW8RFRP08q6huy3bJGPwXJxza7K-g/output_znZoAX.gif\"/>](http://api.ning.com/files/d70k96K0o0kpAforfvIFvNxmlPooylRiMrdFiIrR1sZbyW7NHKTNsjUDzOsj6-lB6ePBW8RFRP08q6huy3bJGPwXJxza7K-g/output_znZoAX.gif)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 23, 2015 at 7:34pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks for the reply and sorry for delay, time zone and work here. Anyway, I'm having a cognitive dissonance here, just to check if I understand the Reinhart patching correctly, let's say we have 8760 hours a year (which is a close approximation of a value they have in .epw file) and a dome made of 580 patches, so I thought that each patch will have 8760/580 hours, which is about 15 hours, which doesn't make sense after you say that \"Reinhart sky being finer than the hourly resolution of sun positions\".
