{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI am running an energy simulation with honeybee to show indoor microclimate map. The simulation works fine but the honeybee adaptive comfort analysis receipt component keeps show this error message below\u00a0\n\n\n\n1. For one of the meshes in the _viewFactorMesh, the number of faces in the mesh and test points in the _testPtViewFactor do not match.<br/>This can sometimes happen when you have geometry created with one Rhino model tolerance and you generate a mesh off of it with a different tolerance.<br/>Try changing your Rhino model tolerance and seeing if it works.\n\n\n\nThanks for the help\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bLx5PI5eKB3fdt-jcvyFYVxkfSNlK6Qc*DPoZ3XrGF02uGPrMuhr5izIQir05w*nx4ZtWtOaBh7CKFYyCVIyhirhBrc*e7KK/Cattura.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bLx5PI5eKB3fdt-jcvyFYVxkfSNlK6Qc*DPoZ3XrGF02uGPrMuhr5izIQir05w*nx4ZtWtOaBh7CKFYyCVIyhirhBrc*e7KK/Cattura.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1517937", "name": "FINAL_MICROCLIMATE.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Niccolo", "created_at": "April 27, 2016 at 1:56pm", "created_by": "Niccolo844", "topic": "Honeybee Adaptive Comfort Analysis Receipt Bug", "replies": [{"body": "\nNiccolo,\n\nThe error is happening for a very simple reason. \u00a0You flattened the vieFactorMesh output from the \"View Factor\" component and the other component rely on the data tree structure of this output in order to understand which meshes correspond to which volumes of air. \u00a0Find a working file attached.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Yh-B8VrdxHgrNQjSPlI4BrOoxqLCSMSwuqFeL7l39IBUJJcLYgPA7V93I*KvHriGA*ehEN3rP1WUHp*I9kEp-QQ5kVs5FrgN/FixedMicroclimateGHFile.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Yh-B8VrdxHgrNQjSPlI4BrOoxqLCSMSwuqFeL7l39IBUJJcLYgPA7V93I*KvHriGA*ehEN3rP1WUHp*I9kEp-QQ5kVs5FrgN/FixedMicroclimateGHFile.JPG)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1519167", "name": "FINAL_MICROCLIMATE_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 1:11pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you Chris!!
