{"body": "\nhallo Forum,\n\n\n\nI am trying since days but i am still not able to do it. Attached is the gh file. As you can see (after running), the values in the mesh ( lux values) doesn't fit the isoline curves results; and in the isolines curves, when it reach the maximum value , it keeps posting the same value; and the lower values in the curve are not close to the ones in the mesh points.\n\n( i am not able to fix it through average formula or interpolation...i am not sure actually how..)\n\n\n\nWhat i want in the isoline curve is to show values for instance from 100 to 1000 Lux with a step of 100 Lux ( i.e : 100, 200, 300, ..., 1000 ). On the other word, I want the scale to have from 100 to 1000 Lux with a step of 100 Lux.\n\n\n\nany idea?\n\n\n\nThanks for your support!\n\n\n\n\n\nnass.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "nass", "created_at": "May 17, 2015 at 8:40am", "created_by": "joe88", "topic": "Isoline curve lux values is not similar or close to the mesh values", "replies": [{"body": "\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/JHmXNI-tCTo*w23RwwZ2nPiBpeucct3QHHE03d5noPT0psBSflgnWm85cjZwJq7-G5sZ5HKu6-2EU0n5ltlba9pyyXg3EF9C/isolines.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/JHmXNI-tCTo*w23RwwZ2nPiBpeucct3QHHE03d5noPT0psBSflgnWm85cjZwJq7-G5sZ5HKu6-2EU0n5ltlba9pyyXg3EF9C/isolines.png)Nass, It needs a little bit of extra math, otherwise it's very similar to what you already have in the file.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1324248", "name": "120515_test_isolines_AY_MSR.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 12, 2015 at 5:34am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nwow Mostapha, Thx a lot!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "nass", "created_at": "August 20, 2015 at 7:54am", "created_by": "joe88", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1288668"}
