Allows any set of hours. Uses many GH components. The title doesn't show the real analysis period. Different results from Devang's.\n\nAbraham's: Flexible. Allows any set of hours. Similar to Chris's, but i wrote a small code that cleans the undesired hours. Basically i set a flag for the desired hours of the year. So they can be mapped with the 3D Chart component. Same results as Chris's.\n\nDon't know how to fix the title issue. Can be nice to have this solved. If any of you have ideas how to do it, will be great.\n\nMaybe this can serve as a basis for a LB component, maybe the analysisPeriod?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1682508", "name": "04_WindAnalysis - NightHoursVersions.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 1, 2017 at 11:27am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nAre you referring to the\u00a0header for flag values?
