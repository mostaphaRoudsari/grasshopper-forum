Would it be possible to use a component and somehow create a single, linear geomtry infront of the window to put the shading devices? If not, do you have any advice on the transmissivity values I can use for those 2 windows in order to 'simulate' their existence?\n\n\n\nThanks alot for the advice!\n\n\n\nHave a nice day.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 18, 2015 at 9:44pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI have a couple of questions regarding your recommendations here above.\n\n1. windowTransmissivity: Can i assume that if i give a value (for instance 0.8) it means that the blinds are covering 80% of the window?

The HBZones connected to the IndoorViewFactor come from each individual zone with outdoors facades. Then the output coming from EPWindowShades is also connected here. Are not the shades taking into account twice in this way? Once for the EP simulation and once more for the comfort recipe? I find this a bit confusing ...

I am in no way an expert, but I understand transmittance is used in most glass specifications (VLT) while transmissivity is a value used in Radiance (my limits of knowledge in optics lol). There is actually an approximation of transmissivity from VLT numbers, which is transmissivity=1.09*(visible light transmittance). I feel 0.8 would be the fraction of light allowed, so it would need to be much lower to 'simulate' blinds (if blinds have a transmittance of close to 0). Perhaps what it can be used is the weighted average of the visible area of the window, with a transmittance x, to the area of the blinds (with a transmittance of 0?). Even if this is correct it would be faulty I think. Actually now I am curious to know what calculations are happening when we connect the shading breps. Are they assumed to have a transmissivity of 0?\n\n\n\nFor your second point, I am interested to hear Chris's thoughts.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 18, 2015 at 11:42pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Theodoros,\n\nNo way the windowTransmissivity refers to the properties of the glass/window. Those you get/give when you define the proper material.\n\nThe hint in the\u00a0AdaptComfRecipe says:\n\nwindowTransmissivity_: An optional decimal value between 0 and 1 that represents the transmissivity of windows around the person.\u00a0 This can also be a list of 8760 values between 0 and 1 that represents a list of hourly window transmissivties, in order to represent the effect of occupants pulling blinds over the windows, etc. Note that you should only set a value here if you are using this component for indoor analysis where the only means by which sunlight will hit an occupant is if it comes through a window.\u00a0 The default is set to 0.7, which is the trasmissivity of the default Honeybee glazing construction.\n\nI understand here that the intention is to combine the influence of shading devices as for the amount of sunlight that enters the space. What i see in the hint is that i can define this \"coefficient\" for each hour of the year.
