{"body": "\nHello everybody,\n\n\n\nI have created a component that calculates the transient PMV from the radTempMtx output. I can visualize this transient comfort with the component \"LadyBug Recolor Mesh\". But I'm having trouble\u00a0 to understand the order of the test points from the \"Honeybee Indoor View Factor\" component.\n\n\n\nI have a matrix like a data tree list that represents the values of WindSpeed in the building, the problem is that I can't find the good order of the test points in the \"Indoor View Factor Component\". If I have this order I would can put my WindSpeed list in the good order and put it as the input of my transient PMV.\n\n\n\nCan anyone explain me this ?\n\n\n\nThank you for your help.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mehdi HAMDANI", "created_at": "April 24, 2017 at 9:32am", "created_by": "MehdiHAMDANI", "topic": "Order of the test points in the Honeybee Indoor View Factor Component", "replies": []}
