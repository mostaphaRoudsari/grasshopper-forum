{"body": "\nHi Mostapha! Won't be the first nor the last to say that the plug-in is incredible!! Thank you and keep up the good work!\n\n\n\nI have a question regarding the solar radiation analysis. I would like to analyse the solar irradiation on a surface within urban context, but as far as I understand the Ladybug_Radiation_analysis tool does not take reflections into account. I also need the hourly irradiation. Is there a way to achieve this with Honeybee?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mihail Todorov", "created_at": "April 11, 2015 at 9:43am", "created_by": "MihailTodorov", "topic": "Honeybee hourly solar radiation", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mihail,\n\n\n\n1. You can use Honeybee to model radiation with Radiance. There you can define the materials for every surface and it will calculate the reflections.\n\n\n\n2. If you are looking to get hourly values for all hours of the year then you need to run an annual analysis. Use DSParameters component to change the study to radiation rather than illuminance. The rest is very similar to annual daylight analysis.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/qk*MmDQsK7r-AAvPLW8kfZ1xGDML-1UJBetYFtWXMQOVq-eIyK6SBcolg5fDWSP6dzB9cAhw14krJFTGO3SiKjhPXKwamC1D/annualRadiationAnalysis.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/qk*MmDQsK7r-AAvPLW8kfZ1xGDML-1UJBetYFtWXMQOVq-eIyK6SBcolg5fDWSP6dzB9cAhw14krJFTGO3SiKjhPXKwamC1D/annualRadiationAnalysis.png)\n\nIf you haven't done any daylight simulation with Honeybee before there are couple of example files here: ([https://app.box.com/s/znns0dtewd1tclicx74q](https://app.box.com/s/znns0dtewd1tclicx74q)) and here is a full workshop ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkjfDmSc5OryXkWSt57ltJFU4qXD...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkjfDmSc5OryXkWSt57ltJFU4qXD5ss1v)).\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 11, 2015 at 11:05am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha!\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for the reply and the links!\u00a0\n\nI am trying to do this now, but I run into some problems:\n\n\n\n1.
