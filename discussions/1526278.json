{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\nI am running energy simulations with Honeybee/energyPlus.I would like to be able to account for the influence of the urban context on one building's heating/cooling loads.\n\nThe solar masks aspects are ok. I have a brep for the urban context that I input in the \"Honeybee EP Context Surfaces\" component.\n\nBut I don't find the way to input albedo/reflectance values for the urban context. I have tried to input a RADMaterial in the \"Honeybee EP Context Surfaces\" component. But my simulation results do not change when I change the reflectance of the RADMaterial.\n\nMany thanks in advance for your help!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marc Lotteau", "created_at": "May 9, 2016 at 6:30am", "created_by": "MarcLotteau", "topic": "Energy Simulation, taking into account albedo of urban context", "replies": [{"body": "\nMarc,\n\nThe E+context doesn't take into account the properties of the surroundings.

This is normal that it's not changing the results.\n\n\n\nEnergyPlus shading objects don't have a field for reflectance and use .2 as default. You can use [ShadingProperty:Reflectance](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-1/input-output-reference/page-011.html#shadingpropertyreflectance)\u00a0to change the default value. We don't support this in Honeybee interface right now but you can create the objects and add them to your energy model using additionalStrings_\u00a0input.\n\n\n\nI put a simple example together were I change the reflection for shading surfaces to .5 for unglazed part of shading and portion and .7 for glazed part. I also set the percentage of glazing to 50% of the surface area.\n\nI didn't put any input checks. Make sure to read the documentation to put valid input values for energyplus otherwise the energyplus simulation will fail. I also assumed that all the shading surfaces (context) will be planar surfaces.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ZGfhtH4*NPR9Kgxe94uspPh4lupqOZDWeDi4y*HtzwrGNrgS7HQBwaCsD*OblsAfERPDknAR40NiKwwMZZeBg5n*3FsyYD7G/shadingReflectance.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ZGfhtH4*NPR9Kgxe94uspPh4lupqOZDWeDi4y*HtzwrGNrgS7HQBwaCsD*OblsAfERPDknAR40NiKwwMZZeBg5n*3FsyYD7G/shadingReflectance.png)\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that it will only effect the results if you are using one of the solar distributions with reflections. Honeybee is using\u00a0FullInteriorAndExteriorWithReflections by default so you should be fine if you're using the default settings.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1526513", "name": "shadingReflectance.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 9, 2016 at 8:38am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHmmmm,\n\nI learned something new today!!\n\nAlways related to the shading objects as they are all under the same conditions.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 9, 2016 at 9:38am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nExcellent!\n\n\n\nThanks Mostapha, this can come in handy :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 9, 2016 at 8:58pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThanks a lot for your help!\n\nAs I am no expert in e+ your example was really useful!\n\nMarc\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marc Lotteau", "created_at": "May 11, 2016 at 12:19am", "created_by": "MarcLotteau", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHi Abraham and Theodore, Now that you both seem to be interested do you think that we should add this to Honeybee shading objects as a default option?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 9, 2016 at 9:00pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI do.
