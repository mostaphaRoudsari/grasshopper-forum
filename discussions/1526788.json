{"body": "\nHi Chris,<br/>May I ask you a question about Therm? I have trouble in understanding the way Therm calculates the U value. I think that it should be like this: lambda(W/mk which Therm knows as Conductivity of the material) divided to depth(m). Then for adjacent materials, They should \u00a0be summed up according to their areas or here since it is 2D according to their lengths in proportion to the whole length. This means that for a singular material Lambda and U-value must be equal if the depth is 1000 mm, But in Therm they are significantly different. Am I missing something?\u00a0<br/>\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Farnaz", "created_at": "May 9, 2016 at 11:00pm", "created_by": "Farnaz609", "topic": "Therm", "replies": [{"body": "\nFarnaz,\u00a0\n\nWhile I have never seen the code behind therm I am almost sure they are also considering surface resistance to account for radiative and/or convective heat transfer.\n\n\n\nWhat you mentioned previously accounts for the thermal resistance in solid conduction through the width of the material. U = R^(-1).... R= L / lambda-solid ( per unit area - m^2 K / W)\n\nThe boundary conditions are likely being considered for convection and radiative transfer. Esentially the U-Value as used in the building industry is a coupling for:\n\nSolid Conduction = ( lambda-solid / Length )* (T1 -T2)\n\nRadiative Transfer = (1- reflectance) (irradiance) ... this is a simplification, it can get super complex\n\nConvective Transfer = hahaha I cannot remember this... but it's essentially (Tsurface - T1) / Convective Resistance.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI just want to reiterate that I am not certain of the calculations carried out in therm. However, I am confident that the U-value is a simplification that couples all thermal exchange mechanisms into the reciprocal of a single resistance. U = 1 / R-coupled.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\nMauricio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mauricio Aguilar Cardenas", "created_at": "May 10, 2016 at 4:26am", "created_by": "MauricioAguilarCardenas135", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you very much Mauricio for your helpful explanation.\n\nHowever I think for a solid material radiative and convective transfer would affect insignificantly,dont they?

Still for a simple box of Aluminum, I expect an almost similar U-value and lambda, (not equal due to radiation and convection transfer) if the box is 1 m length. But the amounts are very very different. While Al- lambda is 237 W/m.k , Therm calculates the U of the assumed box 4.59 W/m^2.k .
