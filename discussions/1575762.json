I think that a possible way to model water with Energy Plus is the following module:\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bCfB14IUU7LyU13uShin7kolSV0v5HLO10UIBw-z5j1cIp3aIqLIw33lxNK-7wt2cdwYYZQQKUVtf2AhEA3oeaFKGTqcZmim/suggestion_.png?width=450\" width=\"450\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bCfB14IUU7LyU13uShin7kolSV0v5HLO10UIBw-z5j1cIp3aIqLIw33lxNK-7wt2cdwYYZQQKUVtf2AhEA3oeaFKGTqcZmim/suggestion_.png)\n\nYou can find the documentation of it here:\n\n**\"The Indoor Swimming Pool object is used to describe the indoor swimming pools that are exposed to the internal environment. There are several rules that should be noted regarding the specification of an indoor pool in EnergyPlus. First, the pool is linked to a surface that must be a floor. The pool is assumed to cover the entire floor to which it is linked. If the pool only covers part of the floor in the actual building, then the user must break the floor up into multiple sections [...]\"**\n\n[http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/input-output-reference/gr...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/input-output-reference/group-internal-gains-people-lights-other.html#swimmingpoolindoor)\n\n\n\nI think it is possible to add this feature to Honeybee.\n\n\n\nHi Chris and Mostapha, what do you think about?\n\n\n\nBest<br/>Antonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "August 3, 2016 at 6:38am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Antonello!\n\nI will have a look at this.

The question of whether you can model these features in the way that you envision depends largely on whether you can find suitable EnergyPlus objects in that web page.\u00a0 The swimming pool seems like it will be sufficient to model the water features but the vegetation may be a bit more complex and you might need to find a substitute.\n\n\n\nSince there are no Grasshopper components in Honeybee to model these things, you will have to add them to the HB EnergyPlus model using the additionalStrings_ input on the Openstudio or EnergyPlus components.\u00a0 Here is an example of how to add additional IDF text to a model in grasshopper:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Evaporative_Cooling_Tower&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\nThis example is specifically for modeling an evaporative cooling tower, which could be a workaround for vegetation if you get the evaporation of the tower to match your anticipated evaporation from plants in the space (you might have to heavily schedule the cooling tower's use to do so).\u00a0 Here is another example of using custom IDF text to model a green roof:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Green_Roof_In_Energy_Model&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\nThe only reason why I think this green roof might to be suitable to model your vegetation is that the E+ reference stresses that this vegetation is only intended for exterior surfaces like green roofs and not interior vegetation.\u00a0 It is also seemingly only intended to model low-lying vegetation and not vegetation from trees, which it seems you might have in your model.\n\n\n\nI'm very interested in hearing the answers to the unmet hours discussion as my my suggested workarounds for indoor vegetation are very hacky.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 3, 2016 at 8:04am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}]}
