{"body": "\nDear Mosthapha and Honeybee developers, greetings. I have an issue when trying to create custom EP materials and constructions: 1.- The \u201cuserCustomEPLibrary.idf\u201d file in my working folder (the one that I\u2019ve putted on the HBHB input) seems to have no changes (it says \u201c!Honeybee custom EnergyPlus library\u201d only when I open it with a text editor) when using addToEPConsLibrary. Nevertheless, some times I can use \u201clocally\u201d the material\u2019s names for setting the constructions (weird). 2.- When I try to Call those materials and constructions on another GH expression (supposing that those were added) the callFromEPConsLibrary component don\u2019t deliver any data.\u00a0\n\nI've read that this issue was fixed but i don't know what i am doing wrong, so please help!\n\n\n\nBest Regards and thank you for this awesome development!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pablo Salvador Banda", "created_at": "March 5, 2015 at 8:49pm", "created_by": "PabloSalvadorBanda", "topic": "Create custom EP materials and constructions,", "replies": [{"body": "\nPablo,\n\nI do not think that I fully understand your question but I can say that the construction library in the\u00a0userCustomEPLibrary.idf is separate from the project library that is created when you write a material/construction into the library with the \"AddToEPLibrary\" component. \u00a0The latter is just written to the computer memory of the Grasshopper file and is deleted as soon as you close the GH file. \u00a0Not sure if this helps. \u00a0I don't know what you mean by \"locally\"\n\nWhat are you writing in to the\u00a0userCustomEPLibrary.idf? \u00a0Perhaps it is not the right format. \u00a0Can you upload your userCustomEPLibrary.idf\u00a0file?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 10, 2015 at 5:15pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nI think I wrote something wrong in my userCustomEPLibrary.idf (attached).
