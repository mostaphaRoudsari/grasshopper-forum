{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI've been preparing this discussion for some time now.\n\nI was in doubt if continue this [discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hobeybee-hourly-solar-radiation) or start a new one. So here we are: a new one.\n\nThere are 2 issues that are bothering me with the radiation results, specially when comparing the results from LB with those of HB.\n\nIssue 1: Results so different.\n\nIn the attached file upper part to the right of the canvas you see both definitions (LB and HB). The images obtained show results so different that i can't find a logic explanation (2.46 vs 41 kWh/m2 for the same period of time). I believe that LB are in the OK range. HB are to high for just 5 hrs of calculation. I don't believe the material definition are making such a big difference (though i tried to have them similar).\n\n\n\nIssue 2: Can't get annual grid based calculations plotted.\n\nIn the attached, right side at the bottom. I get the calculation, but after connecting the results to the HB_readAllTheDSHourlyResults it takes ages to calculate and at the end rhino crashes. Can be that this is a memory problem? Or there is a way to make this work (total annual radiation for GridBased simulation)? For now i disabled the component, but i just wonder ...\n\n\n\nWords of wisdom for both issues will be appreciated.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1375321", "name": "05_SunlightHourAnalysis_CrossTower-V0_Honeybee_Done_01.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 7, 2015 at 10:35pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "Radiation Results - LB & HB", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "October 8, 2015 at 6:11am", "created_by": "Claudio", "replies": [{"body": "\nI hope i'm doing something wrong.
