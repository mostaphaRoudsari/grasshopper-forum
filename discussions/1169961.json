If you put breps as input then the data will be branched but once the input is a joined mesh it will be flatten. You can use unflatten component to branch them out based on your meshing pattern.\n\n\n\nBack to RAM issues there are couple of things that could be considered, and\u00a0implemented. One of the solutions is exactly what you mentioned. The other one is to de-activate undo for the component. I assume that Grasshopper/Rhino keeps the data for undo in the RAM (I haven't tested this and I can be wrong but this is my understanding.)- Finally I might be able to delete some of the data after assigning them to outputs.

I get one radiation mesh still but the radiation results are branched. So at first I tried to map the values with colors and represent the value with lines/ circles - just to start out.

The testing points are center points of the mesh faces. but no problem, I could just evaluate mesh and get normals in branches that way. easy.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/YLaeso7tISB7wbBnP5k9qOkBG41jyRvQwhRpGibUS3HVek*uIdusjs4M4iUxphcU56Fas7nHPzZm-mh36kbbY4J2WcmaNcIm/Screenshot2014112010.59.05_fix.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/YLaeso7tISB7wbBnP5k9qOkBG41jyRvQwhRpGibUS3HVek*uIdusjs4M4iUxphcU56Fas7nHPzZm-mh36kbbY4J2WcmaNcIm/Screenshot2014112010.59.05_fix.png)\n\nNow the issue however, is that the points are in branches, but they are not necessarily in an order that is useful. It is because there are triangle and square faces mixed. for this one brep face, the algorithm created two triangular wedges that when in as a list of points, it is either listed in the beginning or the end of the points. so - if you read the polyline of the points, you see first the polyline skips the mid row, and anyways, you can see there is a problem with the way I'm using exploded breps as inputs although it would be the easiest way to organize and branch the testing points, the radiation result values, and the face normals.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/YLaeso7tISDGiPUOJIXWSRGUhhVkh6scP85iIReLN4-hL7Dr-hCaohidKQYdr9C2N*Vk*MJWy*-u9MLlfe566tGo3YFcWPSm/Screenshot2014112011.22.43_fix.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/YLaeso7tISDGiPUOJIXWSRGUhhVkh6scP85iIReLN4-hL7Dr-hCaohidKQYdr9C2N*Vk*MJWy*-u9MLlfe566tGo3YFcWPSm/Screenshot2014112011.22.43_fix.jpg)\n\n\n\nSo alternatively I could mesh the breps first, then use the meshing pattern to unflatten the.. radiation mesh? I dont know what you I mean, I have to try it myself. If I can control the way the brep is meshed, and then It might be possible for me to also have a consistent logic of how test points are organized... which I think is really crucial to work with the radiation results. For example, If I want to some how get this information over to revit (I think [Mr. Sobon](http://http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/konradksobon)\u00a0recently release Mantis Shrimp), I would need to have the points organized neatly.\n\n\n\nI will post if I get some progress on the meshing approach you suggested. I think the way triangle and quad faces are mixed are a bit random now... or it might be that I can find a clever way to list points... I think [Mr Stasiuk](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/DavidStasiuk)\u00a0had some interesting approahes with mesh indices.\n\n\n\n//\u00a0\n\nAs for the RAM issue, I don't understand how grasshopper handles ram enough to comment on what you said. But if there were a \"purge\" function where the user can decide to empty undo history after saving the definition, and if that lowers RAM use, that would make a lot of sense.\n\n\n\n// as for SAM, I'm glad to know it exists and I have to look in it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "November 20, 2014 at 9:42am", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8fil5gmLgTbSS4*df5HO8hiEFZm-Tag2nutZDArblUGZ22Z-g2Jvpc30xU9cNJXG4ez4JNAzHJKda8HQN97D8OYJOdGNe7-T/Screenshot2014112514.09.00.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/8fil5gmLgTbSS4*df5HO8hiEFZm-Tag2nutZDArblUGZ22Z-g2Jvpc30xU9cNJXG4ez4JNAzHJKda8HQN97D8OYJOdGNe7-T/Screenshot2014112514.09.00.png)so I decided to down the analysis area and up the sample rate.\n\nthis took about 22 mins to analyze.

Thank you Mostapha.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LG4v1FKIM7lkffLqJlUIALmndzPRZAY0K5Bd4EhIjsQ2UDYBHlr2lxgwg1K4E4zt6CAzH*j4qClvfTOOQkH6ukbT1KLVohEr/radiation_testPT_panelization.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/LG4v1FKIM7lkffLqJlUIALmndzPRZAY0K5Bd4EhIjsQ2UDYBHlr2lxgwg1K4E4zt6CAzH*j4qClvfTOOQkH6ukbT1KLVohEr/radiation_testPT_panelization.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1177143", "name": "averageForEachPanel_yj.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "November 28, 2014 at 3:35am", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KBI*TiKs6pLX97XqIZvJylzAV2HDr0gp*7vCi2Vo*IdGnIbUf67cZdyAh5tpHK1Qcp04fUbI8DJFJd38CI52qItl0cxkOEjH/ttt_export_screenshot01.jpg)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KBI*TiKs6pLfB3He*FMaJTd9pgT--W*wFG0DDfO7R8UzMyww1NJVMGOX*52RrTCy1AlRMxSKqozfnj9rzhFPsYgCwdLEo8nR/ttt_export_screenshot00.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KBI*TiKs6pLfB3He*FMaJTd9pgT--W*wFG0DDfO7R8UzMyww1NJVMGOX*52RrTCy1AlRMxSKqozfnj9rzhFPsYgCwdLEo8nR/ttt_export_screenshot00.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approach you showed me was what I was looking for. I am more versatile modelling with nurbs surfaces so I was going to have mesh as like the information layer and the nurbs surfaces as the fabrication layer. But since branching test points and test vectors relating to a large number of surfaces or curve inclusion is such a bottleneck,\u00a0now I do get the feeling that gaining more sophisticated control over the meshing process would be important to work with ladybug components.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBy the way, I have noticed that the radiation result is very different whether I input one mesh or a lot of surfaces. and the earlier version of the component (0.0.54) is now throwing up error saying \"too many values to unpack\" which means the component is out of date, I suppose.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KBI*TiKs6pI6kw92FjqNtNF1yPNKPVGUs1q3GY5A7jTBcZTzd85BNa9X5ZLbNaMZhThKFW7mSkMLkT3pklQjZfopp-RNpZaU/ttt_export_screenshot02.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KBI*TiKs6pI6kw92FjqNtNF1yPNKPVGUs1q3GY5A7jTBcZTzd85BNa9X5ZLbNaMZhThKFW7mSkMLkT3pklQjZfopp-RNpZaU/ttt_export_screenshot02.jpg)\n\nOn the left image you see radiation mesh (0.0.58) with one mesh as input, and on the right you see radiation mesh with exploded breps as input. To see what is happening inside the box with exploed breps as inputs,\u00a0I tried to see how the meshing is done inside the component (0.0.58) but not a lot of progress so far reading it.\n\n\n\nI am attaching a more concise definition\u00a0and the rhino file if you find the time to take a closer look.\u00a0\n\nRhino file is\u00a0[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rkdarg2fhvpwfiz/ttt_export%20%282%29.3dm?dl=0)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1179261", "name": "ttt.exportgh4.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "December 1, 2014 at 2:08pm", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1169961"}
