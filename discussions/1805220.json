Would anyone have suggestions for best learning resources based on personal experience? I am willing to pay for these materials if need be.\n\n\n\nI am primarily interested in a pure Honeybee &gt; OpenStudio workflows - but I have also run into situations where I felt like it would have been beneficial to know SketchUp and to know how to generate an OpenStudio file with SketchUp.\n\n\n\nAny and all thoughts would be much appreciated!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ernst Bay", "created_at": "August 28, 2017 at 8:50am", "created_by": "ErnstBay", "topic": "OpenStudio Learning Resources", "replies": [{"body": "\nhi,,\u00a0\n\ni used this attached to start learning grasshopper and it's useful and good start .\n\ngood luck\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "tariq hilmy", "created_at": "on Monday", "created_by": "tariqhilmy", "replies": [{"body": "\nNo attachment.
