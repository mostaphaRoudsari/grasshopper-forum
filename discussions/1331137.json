If I look at the image/colors with my common sense I would say where there is blue color is areas where the shade is harmful because of the surrounding buildings creates shade, and the red areas is where shade would be useful. But the simulated result gives the opposite result I would say.\n\nInfo about the setup:\n\nThanks,\n\ndaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1331136", "name": "Ladybug_Shade-Benefit-01.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "daniel nielsen", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 1:29am", "created_by": "arkdanielnielsen", "topic": "Q - Comfort Shade Benefit evaluator", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Daniel,\n\nit makes sense to me what you are getting.\n\nThe result is the output f the component\u00a0shadeNetEffect. It means that it takes both the Benefit and the Harm and gives you the annual evaluation of the proposed shading element. It means that your blue areas have more benefit than harm and the red areas the opposite. The harm means that you are spoiling the space for winter time (which is different that saying \"not useful\" as you wrote or ask). Though the shade can also be useful for summer.\n\nYou can try to map just the\u00a0shadeHelpfulness/shadeHarmfulness outputs and see the \"real\" seasonal effect of the shade device. If you need an axample for that i can provide.\n\nHope it helps.\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 4:52am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Abraham, it would be great if you had an example.\n\n/daniel\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "daniel nielsen", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 5:01am", "created_by": "arkdanielnielsen", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHere you go.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1331098", "name": "Shade Benefit_Out_Clean_01_TMP.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 5:09am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks Abraham - a very good example file!\n\nThe key point for other followers is the Shade Net Effect (check the red arrows) - based on the calculation of Heating/Cooling Degree Days!\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7466U3ZMMqXKMK9*3lLOUeeE0C*aCPfJEjT-fGdoMEu9CyCHxv87Y8S1qhaKyfHyS7*64UvIRa-IwPt51t1ZZAk*zvzX-OWg/Ladybug_ShadeBenefit02.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/7466U3ZMMqXKMK9*3lLOUeeE0C*aCPfJEjT-fGdoMEu9CyCHxv87Y8S1qhaKyfHyS7*64UvIRa-IwPt51t1ZZAk*zvzX-OWg/Ladybug_ShadeBenefit02.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "daniel nielsen", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 1:20pm", "created_by": "arkdanielnielsen", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nBy the way - I think the trick with extended lines ;)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "daniel nielsen", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 1:21pm", "created_by": "arkdanielnielsen", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1331137"}
