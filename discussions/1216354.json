{"body": "\nHello Mostapha and Chris,\n\n\n\nTwo questions regarding EP components:\n\n\n\n1) I n the attached file I am trying to calculate energy values for\u00a0 custom made zone, of a stand alone volume, but not all of Energy Use outputs are generated. Only Electric Light and Electric Equipment.\n\n<br/>The runEnergySimulation report says **\"The following Report Variables were requested\u00a0 but not generated because IDF did not contain these elements or misspelled variable name -- check .rdd file\"**.\n\n\n\n2) When using a local Weather File and not the URL file location the EP runEnergySimulation is not working.\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\nDimitris\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1216353", "name": "Annual_Loads_Custom_Zone.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "February 3, 2015 at 8:54am", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Custom Made Zone problems: Zone Energy Use Variables not generated / Local Weather File not Working", "replies": [{"body": "\nFor point 1 you need to set the _isConditioned to True in the HB_createHBZones component.\n\nFor point 2, you have a space in the path (Dropbox (RAFT ...).
