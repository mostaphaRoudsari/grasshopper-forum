{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\nI have been watching the Chris Mackey\u00b4s videos \"HoneyBee Energy Modelling\" (thanks a lot!! they are sooo useful)\u00a0because I would like to start\u00a0runnig multi-zone simulations. But there is something that I don\u00b4t know/understand.. Is it possible to assign just to one surface an alternate boundary condition?\n\nI mean, through the \"Honeybee_Solve Adjacencies\" component i am able to assign different\u00a0BC between two zones, but in that case, maybe more than\u00a0a wall\u00a0will change its BC.\n\nWhat should I do to change the BC just to one wall?\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia \u00a0\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 21, 2016 at 7:30am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Multi-Zones Boundary Conditions", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Claudia,\n\nI'll recommend you to take a look at the following HB components:\n\nsetEPZoneCnstr\n\nsetEPSrfCnstr\n\nsetEPZoneIntCnstr\n\nYou'll probably will need the last one, but all of them are intended to change specific zones, usually, after they get default values (but not only).\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 21, 2016 at 9:44am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nthans a lot for your advices. I was looking to those components but as i could understand i just can use them to change the EP construction, so then their stratigraphy and characteristics of each material (roughness, thickness...).\n\nMeanwhile I didn\u00b4t find the way to change the Boundary Conditions (Adiabatic, Outdoors...). Is it possible?\u00a0If yes, can you please\u00a0show me the worflow to do that?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 22, 2016 at 2:32am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nClaudia,\n\nThe \"best\" i can offer is this [link.](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/adiabatic-or-outdoors?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1467923&amp;xg_source=activity&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\n\nThis is a discussion i opened and Chris's recommendations and solution are pretty good.\n\nHopefuly they will work for you too.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 22, 2016 at 3:35am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1551861"}
