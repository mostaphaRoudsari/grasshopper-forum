{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nBefore I miss it for this year, here is a short notice for the longest night of the year!\n\n\n\nIn celebration of #WinterSolstice I started a new #opensource project: epwmap!\n\n\n\n#epwmap is an interactive map to access and download EPW weather files hosted on US Department of Energy website.\n\n\n\nYou can check it live here: [http://mostapharoudsari.github.io/epwmap/](http://mostapharoudsari.github.io/epwmap/)\n\n\n\nThe project is less than a day old and is a work in progress. At some point soon, this page will makes access to weather data easier for everyone. As always any suggestions/comments/help is much appreciated!\n\n\n\nWe will send a longer post with more details about the development and new features soon.\n\n\n\nHappy Winter/Summer Solstice! #Yalda\n\n\n\nCheers, Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 21, 2014 at 7:07pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "topic": "Happy Winter/Summer Solstice!", "replies": [{"body": "\nThat's Great Bro.
