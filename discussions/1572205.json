{"body": "\nHello All,\n\n\n\nI am trying to add blinds to my model to generate\u00a0the energy consumption in two scenarios: (1) blinds open, and (2) blinds closed. I am using the schedules Always On for the scenario 1 and Always Off to scenario 2 (these are\u00a0controlled\u00a0by a basic python script). For some reason, I cannot generate the HBObjWShades output. I have tried multiple settings to solve the issue without any success. I need the blinds to cover all window.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for the assistance in advance,\n\nBest,\n\nJoao P. Carneiro\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1572204", "name": "EnergyAnalysisMultipleZones2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Joao Pedro Carneiro", "created_at": "July 27, 2016 at 6:39pm", "created_by": "JoaoPedroCarneiro", "topic": "Adding Blinds to a Model Using Honeybee_EPWindowShades", "replies": [{"body": "\nJoao,\n\nUpdate your components to the latest version (see attached).\n\nAlso, E+ can't generate a blinds material for a shade that is deeper than 1 meter. \u00a0For these cases, you should just take the shadeBreps, plug them into a HBContext component.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1572267", "name": "EnergyAnalysisMultipleZones2_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 27, 2016 at 7:31pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Chris for the help.\n\n\n\nEarlier today, I used the update honeybee and update ladybug components.
