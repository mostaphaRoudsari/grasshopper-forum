{"body": "\nHi\n\nI've been having problems with using the Analysis period component when I use the psychrometric chart tool for plotting the hour point in Fahrenheit.\n\nI am trying to plot out hourly point for each seasons of the year and it shows up exactly as I want it in SI units but as soon as I convert it to IP units, the points are plotted way above the psych chart curves.\n\nI attached the SI version that works and the end results along with the IP version that shows the error.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nKen\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" height=\"241\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/gkB0q9PO6*a4wxnXpgz9wt8Mf93YihkiJ*c67K2UJMsucZzqA5Fa9xhJ8dxU7lBRKgAXW604q93yWL04vzgi36Ix28b7tPXj/Seasonspsychchart.png?width=750\" width=\"374\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/gkB0q9PO6*a4wxnXpgz9wt8Mf93YihkiJ*c67K2UJMsucZzqA5Fa9xhJ8dxU7lBRKgAXW604q93yWL04vzgi36Ix28b7tPXj/Seasonspsychchart.png)[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/gkB0q9PO6*YCCIySfJ4yOay34Xs*OQgCYjzIPBbcMFChOfFBv6lDqAsCHrAbJtccJdJS96yR5vpumf1IKJk5iGqwrpmiUBX2/Analysisperiod.png?width=377\" width=\"377\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/gkB0q9PO6*YCCIySfJ4yOay34Xs*OQgCYjzIPBbcMFChOfFBv6lDqAsCHrAbJtccJdJS96yR5vpumf1IKJk5iGqwrpmiUBX2/Analysisperiod.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1506396", "name": "Seasons_Psych_Chart_SI.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1506397", "name": "Psych_Chart_IP_Units_Analysis period.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ken Takahashi", "created_at": "April 11, 2016 at 8:10pm", "created_by": "KenTakahashi", "topic": "Analysis Period error in Psych chart", "replies": [{"body": "\nHey can anyone help me try to fix this?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ken Takahashi", "created_at": "April 14, 2016 at 10:32am", "created_by": "KenTakahashi", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ken,\n\n\n\nI ran into the same issue.
