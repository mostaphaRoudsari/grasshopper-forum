{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\ni'm really new to honeybee and tried to set up a model of a complete building. i tried to follow the steps of chris's tutorial videos so far (they are really helpful, thank you).\n\n\n\ni've tried to run the simulation but got an error :hb_EPZoneSurface' object has no attribute 'surface'\n\nso i've updated all the user objects because the topic has been discussed before but now i get a new error concerning the grasshopper objects i used to manually input the windows into the model. i also tried to use the honeybee object to scale my surfaces but it got an error here as well: wrong input for HBOJ\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8kkt4Vvp7GwP4HuJj6sWCBvoCaKy8g3r63OX3bMJ99lqll6JKXtJdsxGgmKwglXNGuifQgF2b55UrGpL3Yk9oqhLdwcmC0AK/gh_131216.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/8kkt4Vvp7GwP4HuJj6sWCBvoCaKy8g3r63OX3bMJ99lqll6JKXtJdsxGgmKwglXNGuifQgF2b55UrGpL3Yk9oqhLdwcmC0AK/gh_131216.PNG)\n\n\n\nsince this is my first simulation i'm really not sure where to start debugging or if the model can even be analyized the way i've tried to set it up? \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1657220", "name": "analyse_model_131216.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Benny Pfister", "created_at": "December 13, 2016 at 9:10am", "created_by": "BennyPfister", "topic": "Solution exception: 525bdb17024742cc8a5f_1 has been moved, scaled or rotated.

There are open and invalid breps in your workflow. Please see attached 01. It is strongly advised that the HbZones shall be a closed volume. That's not happening still. see attached 02. The adjacent surfaces should be similar, otherwise, the adjacency\u00a0calculation will give an error. This needs to be addressed to. All in all, you still need to take a good look at how your geometry is being supplied to Run Energy Simulation\u00a0component.\n\n\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1658148", "name": "01.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1658149", "name": "02.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1658150", "name": "03.png"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "December 14, 2016 at 8:35pm", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nYou should pay close attention to geometries shown in attached 04.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1657974", "name": "04.png"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "December 14, 2016 at 8:37pm", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nhy devang\n\nthanks a lot for your effort. i can see there is some work to do.\u00a0\n\n-benny\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Benny Pfister", "created_at": "December 16, 2016 at 12:41am", "created_by": "BennyPfister", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1657221"}
