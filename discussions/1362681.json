The first one is to mesh the surfaces and then write each surface separately. The second one (which is what honeybee is using in cases like yours) is to connect the corner of the outside curve to the inside curve and split it from there.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3FLLVGZOVWLCTUfrPzsmIT29j551Ag8mqMB3AzRXjOo9nStjmqecrilgmsvT*o4e4rh5hay3DgRHb5wIwqLAZk8sxDRrV2Ld/1.jpg\" width=\"640\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3FLLVGZOVWLCTUfrPzsmIT29j551Ag8mqMB3AzRXjOo9nStjmqecrilgmsvT*o4e4rh5hay3DgRHb5wIwqLAZk8sxDRrV2Ld/1.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 22, 2015 at 5:01pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}
