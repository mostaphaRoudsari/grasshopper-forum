{"body": "\nHello all,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to work with Radiance Trans Material but I'm having little trouble understading how it works.\n\nI've read the document \"\u2018Trans Materials \u2013Modeling and Specifying a Next Generation\" by\u00a0David Mead ([http://radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2010-freiburg/PDF/Da...](http://radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2010-freiburg/PDF/DavidMead.pdf)). It was very helpful but still I'm not confident with this kind of material.\n\n\n\nI'll explain shortly my design.\n\nI'm trying to bring natural light deeper into a generic building. To do so, I want to use a system in which a mirror outside the facade directs the sunlight through a horizontal shaft composed of mirrors on the upper part and on the sides with a \"membrane\" on the lower side defined as a \"Trans Material\".\n\n\n\nMy goal is to obtain an effect like the one showed in the attached photo. It's a skylight make of opaque semi-transparent plastic.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDoes anyone know any good parameter to simulate that?\n\n\n\nI'm attaching also a little section and the gh file.\n\n\n\nThanks everybody for your help.\n\n\n\nAlessandro\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1417339", "name": "IMG_8551.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1417340", "name": "Diffusore.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1417341", "name": "Scene.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Alessandro Corso", "created_at": "December 8, 2015 at 8:17am", "created_by": "AlessandroCorso", "topic": "Radiance Trans Material question.", "replies": [{"body": "\nAlessandro,\n\nI'm not clear about your question. Do you have difficulties creating the materials or do you want to know about Radiance parameters to see the effect of multiple bounces.\n\nFor the material your best bet is to find the values from a measurement. Is there a company that you're using their material. They might have an accurate measurement or a BSDF file for their product.\n\nFor the second part of the question check [Andy's approach](http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2014-london/presentations/day1/McNeil_BSDFsandPhases.pdf)\u00a0to model a light-pipe using 3Phase method. It's not possible to run a 3-Phase daylight analysis with Honeybee at this point. :|\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 9, 2015 at 8:15am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}
