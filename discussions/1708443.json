{"body": "\nHi\u00a0\n\nI love the Therm Tool in Honeybee - makes creating Therm geometry so much easier. Thank you Mostapha &amp; Chris (&amp; whoever else worked on this - its a killer app). I'm currently running a Therm analysis on an aluminum window assembly - and it ran fine in therm (pdf solution attached). However, when I try to bring it back into grasshopper, I get an error message (index out of range exception). I'd appreciate any help with the reason for the error.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nVikram\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1708441", "name": "Capture.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1708442", "name": "CONSTANT7d_AL_FRM_thmx.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Vikram Sami", "created_at": "March 8, 2017 at 6:39pm", "created_by": "VikramSami", "topic": "Error Bringing Therm Solution back to Grasshopper", "replies": [{"body": "\nVikram,\n\nTry updating your file.
