I get question about analysis period.<br/> Can I make analysis period more than one year or repeat simulation to make correct initial setting?\n\nIt needs warming up period when I run thermal simulation to get correct output.<br/> If we run simulation without warming up, results in former period is incorrect because initial thermal situation is determined by program.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ryosuke Maruyama", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 12:34am", "created_by": "RyosukeMaruyama", "topic": "warming up period", "replies": [{"body": "\nRyosuke,\n\nYou can't run simulation for more than one year as EPW files contain only one year of data. \u00a0However, you can change the number of warmup days that the simulation runs before it starts writing results and this is a such a quick thing to implement so I just added this ability on the Simulation Control component.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-FxrWMrAPzgpG9ynxqsOFd2cPTs2zTcUNs3U8bNQnAvpCXI0Ov6UWBzaMKHd3oLt9aODRX4rP6tVYXul8ogyFsmB90zhyxgW/AddedWarmupDays.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-FxrWMrAPzgpG9ynxqsOFd2cPTs2zTcUNs3U8bNQnAvpCXI0Ov6UWBzaMKHd3oLt9aODRX4rP6tVYXul8ogyFsmB90zhyxgW/AddedWarmupDays.JPG)\n\nSee the attached file for an example of how to implement it.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1278990", "name": "AddedWarmupDays.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 4:26pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you Chris!\n\nI'll try it.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ryosuke Maruyama", "created_at": "May 6, 2015 at 3:58am", "created_by": "RyosukeMaruyama", "replies": []}]}]}
