{"body": "\nHi All!\n\nI am Atta, from Indonesia. \u00a0I have been following video tutes by Chris Mackey on energy Simulation, it is really helpful videos for a beginner. \u00a0When I constructed my own energy model (a very simple one), following instruction from Chris's Videos, it seems no problem. \u00a0However, when I used Bandung weather file (.epw) for simulation, it did not run successfully. \u00a0The unusual thing is that when I changed to default weather file (.epw) coming with Energyplus installation it was running successfully. \u00a0How can I resolve this problem? Can anyone help me please?\u00a0\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nI can send my grasshopper algo and Bandung EPW file if necessary.\n\n\n\nAtta\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "atthaillah b", "created_at": "June 25, 2016 at 2:15am", "created_by": "atthaillahb", "topic": "EPW File Problem", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Atta, Share the weather file so someone can take a look.
