Are your goal is only to model a room and optimize it for daylight or is it going to be also an energy model at some point? Is the size of the room stays the same during the whole study?\n\nIn any case you need to model light-shelves as separate surfaces and not part of the zone.\n\n\n\nAlso there is also so many extra components in your definition. I would only leave the components which are critical to the study for an optimization case as you need to run so many cases.\n\n\n\nLet me know what are you exactly trying to do and we'll look for alternate solutions.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 7, 2015 at 7:03am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostafa,\n\nThanks for looking at my file,<br/>I didn't understand why lightshelf shouldn't be a part of the zone.<br/>Using the components such as TT toolbox, was because I wanted to save results in any stage that Rhino stops working, so exported data to excel, it can be deleted, not important.\n\nMy final goal is to build and find the mechanism of dynamic lightshelf,\n\nan exterior lightshelf that its angle is variable, and an interior lightshelf that its length is variable, the room and the window stays the same during the hole study.\n\nfor this, there are 2 ways (If I am making a mistake, let me know):\n\n1. to optimize lightshelves based on desired illuminance in each hour.\n\n2. to optimize\u00a0lightshelves based on\u00a0thermal and lighting energy\u00a0in each hour.\n\nSimulation will be repeated in some days as sample for expanding to the whole year.\n\nI am doing the first step (although I wrote an algorithm for the second one, but I thought it takes longer time and the appcrash possibility is higher than the first one)<br/>Hope that explanation was good and enough,\n\nthanks a lot\n\nFahimeh\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Fahimeh Motazedian", "created_at": "September 7, 2015 at 9:58am", "created_by": "FahimehMotazedian", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nMostafa,\n\ndid you read my comment?
