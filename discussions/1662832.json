{"body": "\nHi everyone\n\nI am working on my thesis about \"kinetic facade with efficiency natural ventilation\"\n\nI finished the modeling of kinetic facade with grasshopper and now I want to start\u00a0 efficiency natural ventilation analysis to find best angle of facade,s modules in every time\u00a0 but I don,t know that which plugin is need to my work?? honey bee or butterfly?? or another plugin??\n\nthank you so much\n\n\n\n\n\nthis is my facade,s algorithm\n\n[moeinthesis.gh](http://api.ning.com:80/files/gtZdsTOdq94i3vN3hJvB3sJ7CXOujIN4JousjCEdWAC7pMV6Wq3wL0ROoayt24BnlipQpkOOiYJyayJNAnMn4T9vZMqX9w8I/moeinthesis.gh)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "moein", "created_at": "December 26, 2016 at 12:39am", "created_by": "moein", "topic": "kinetic facade with efficiency ventilation- which plugin?", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Moein\u00a0,\u00a0\n\nmy Master's case study needed to evaluate the thermal &amp; ventilation performance of a certain kinetic\u00a0facade which was designed by another architect. So I used the honeybee energy simulation to get the zones temperature &amp; ventilation rate,\u00a0As I had no choices to evaluate the natural\u00a0ventilation \" there was no butterfly plugin yet \u00a0\". So I depended on the ventilation rate by the facade movement and the amount of air needed inside the building's zones every hour to optimize\u00a0the best facade movement every hour of the day. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nI hope that can help you, but I'm pretty sure that butterfly can help you more.\n\n\n\nMona \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "December 26, 2016 at 9:36am", "created_by": "monarezk", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you to your answer Mona\n\nI have a request to you\n\ncan you put here your algorithm??\n\nI want to read that to find my solution...\n\nthanks a lot..\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "moein", "created_at": "December 27, 2016 at 4:10am", "created_by": "moein", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nMoein,\n\nYou need to clarify what do you mean by \"efficiency natural ventilation analysis\".\n\nGenerally speaking if you need to see the effect of geometry changes on the airflow inside the space you better of using CFD simulation.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 28, 2016 at 4:23pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1662832"}
