{"body": "\nDear Ladybug/Honeybee Community,\n\n\n\nI am studying for a paper in which I will explain my work mathematically. I used radiationAnalysis component in the work. Therefore, I am looking for the calculation function behind \u00a0this component.\u00a0It would be great if you point out any reference?\n\n\n\nThank you for your help,\n\nMustafa\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mustafa Teksoy", "created_at": "October 19, 2015 at 2:12pm", "created_by": "MustafaTeksoy", "topic": "Mathematical function of Ladybug Radiation Analysis", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mustafa, There are two parts to the calculation.\n\nThe first step is generating the sky. Ladybug is using [Radiance's gendaymtx](http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/gendaymtx.pdf)\u00a0to generate the sky. If you set sky density to 0, which is the default value, it will generate a Tregenza sky, and density 1 will generate a Reinhart sky.\n\nThe second step is ray-tracing which Ladybug does it in a simplified fashion. It does shoot a ray from every test point to center of every sky patch, and if the point can see the sky patch it calculates the value based on the angle of incident. The simplification is that the calculation doesn't consider reflections between the surfaces and material surfaces. If you need them to be calculated then you need to use Honeybee.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 24, 2015 at 8:00pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nAnd you can see this visually in this example:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=ayezioro&amp;fork=hy...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=ayezioro&amp;fork=hydra&amp;id=02_Radiation_Vectors2SkyPatches_01)\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 24, 2015 at 10:17pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nWould you please make this more clear and explain more?\n\n\"**and if the point can see the sky patch it **calculates** the value based on the angle of incident.**\"\n\n@Abraham, it would be nice to add the above calculation on your example! and compare a horizontal 1x1m surface radiation from 1.Sun-radiation 2.Sky-patch divisions 3.Total radiation from epw\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "navid", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 4:40am", "created_by": "navidhatefnia", "replies": [{"body": "\nNavid,\n\nHere is what happens inside the component.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LGp38pu00EGIJFAeM-yIvghnXtAFrXu0Cd1Nre07UZC-pqXmty6fYVps1gtyNxxQMdCaFMq9BjKl0B1h2GSHYcRWp60fB*7o/radiationAnalysis.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/LGp38pu00EGIJFAeM-yIvghnXtAFrXu0Cd1Nre07UZC-pqXmty6fYVps1gtyNxxQMdCaFMq9BjKl0B1h2GSHYcRWp60fB*7o/radiationAnalysis.png)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1465247", "name": "radiationAnalysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 17, 2016 at 8:29am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1381958"}
