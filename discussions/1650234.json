{"body": "\nI have done a simple model composed by 2 bedrooms, a kitchen and a living room. I inserted points to create each room, and after that created a box to form the rooms. To add windows I have separated the box in faces and used the honey bee glazing ratio to add windows in the face where the window was suposed to be. After that I created honeybee surfaces and zones and have done the energy simulation in order to obtain operative temperature for each room. Now I want to add internal doors, and I have done the doors using surfaces. How do I do to make honeyBee recognize those surfaces as doors?
