{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI am wondering how should I set up this kind of model for daylight analysis. I guess it should be multiple zones joined at the end. I tried to union it in rhino, but the resulting brep could not be used as a zone. Also, I have a vertical wall for light bouncing, I am not sure how to include it into analysis.\n\n\n\nAlso I would like to ask if it is possible to get analysed grid as a curved surface, rather than flat plane.\n\nRegards,\n\nPetar\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1024837", "name": "prob.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Petar Pejic", "created_at": "March 12, 2014 at 9:33am", "created_by": "PetarPejic", "topic": "how to set up this kind of model", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Petar,\n\nYou don't need to create a zone for this case (however you can). Just use createHBSrfs component and assign the materials to the surfaces (or leave the material input empty if you want to use generic materials). The same goes to the vertical wall.\n\nBack to the second question, you can generate the test points from any surface or mesh. All you need as the input is a list of points and vectors that indicates points direction.\n\nNevertheless, this looks like a great case that I can use to record a tutorial on how you can prepare a model with Honeybee for daylight simulation. If you provide more information here (such as the model itself and material properties) I can capture the video tomorrow evening and post it on YouTube.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 12, 2014 at 10:36am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nDear Mostapha,\n\nthank you for your kind reply.\u00a0\n\nI will be more than happy to provide a model for your demonstration. However, the whole structure is much bigger (around 200x80m) with multiple openings, maybe I could reduce it to half for this purpose. Also, the bottom plane (subject of analysis) is a curved surface, so this could be useful as well. Regarding the material properties, I think a couple of simple material could be used. It would be highly appreciated if you could demonstrate the influence of ' amount of reflection' of base surface on overall result (for example, the amount of reflection of walls).\n\nPM me for the model details.\n\nRegards,\n\nPetar\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Petar Pejic", "created_at": "March 12, 2014 at 11:03am", "created_by": "PetarPejic", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Pitar, Sounds good.
