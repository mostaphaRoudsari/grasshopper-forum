{"body": "\nI added a few lines of new Python codes to a Honeybee component by double click the component and revised the code in the Grasshopper Python Script Editor interface.\n\n\n\nHowever, these codes were gone when I updated the Honeybee components.\n\n\n\nI understand that all LB+HB components are GhPython component. So, which of the following lines of standard code in a LB+HB component can be removed to prevent it from been updated while still maintain the ability to call LB+HB core libraries?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SLnPUVCMGK47fS*Ci8kgAjXRPWwQB24FTIJbuOrrDff44OQ3-7FncjwgF0d0WFqVJnQWBP3X9V9UfHqbwlcFWyW4XcteKwQG/Image8.png\" width=\"529\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SLnPUVCMGK47fS*Ci8kgAjXRPWwQB24FTIJbuOrrDff44OQ3-7FncjwgF0d0WFqVJnQWBP3X9V9UfHqbwlcFWyW4XcteKwQG/Image8.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 11, 2016 at 11:22am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "how to prevent a revised ladybug or honeybee component from been updated?", "replies": [{"body": "\nUpdate component checks the date of the component and if the date is older than the available version it will update the component.
