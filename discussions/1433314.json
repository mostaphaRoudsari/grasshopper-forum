{"body": "\nHi guys,\u00a0\n\nI am having problems in the new version of honeybee with a material that I had previously added to the honeybee library (see the following discussion).\u00a0\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/simulation-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/simulation-of-microshade-using-honeybee?xg_source=activity)\n\nThe thing is that this material that I added to the library is messing the new version of HB. I have reinstalled everythink (radiance, lh and hb) and the problem is still there. How can I delete this material from the library?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/17W2v0xf-z*EzfDxL9tz2QSa0GlGbz*TxNHPelNTwoqRC8CGdpJqYwtQj-owtQ29V30UlwEg7BgA30AwMm8cYVkmEIOK64Kn/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/17W2v0xf-z*EzfDxL9tz2QSa0GlGbz*TxNHPelNTwoqRC8CGdpJqYwtQj-owtQ29V30UlwEg7BgA30AwMm8cYVkmEIOK64Kn/Capture.JPG)\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nAle\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "January 7, 2016 at 3:23am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Problems with the new version of HB", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Alejandro,\n\n\n\nThey are in a file named HoneybeeRadMaterials.mat. You can find it under the Ladybug default folder. Can you share your file with me so I can see why the files is failing to import?
