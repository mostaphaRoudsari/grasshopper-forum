{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI have been going the energy simulation tutorials and I have to say thank you for all the resources you are giving.\n\n\n\nI have a quick question on visualizing results. Is there an option to somehow animate the changes during a whole day, for example of cooling loads or operative temperatures, when visualizing results per zones? Something like a movable step of simulation slider.\n\n\n\nI think it would help both in communicating results as in actually interpreting them.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 31, 2015 at 6:34am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Creating video files out of eplus visualizations", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Theodores,\n\nIf you want to use Ladybug components you can use Ladybug_Capture View component and animate slider to export the images for each time step and then use another tool like Windows Movie Maker or online gif makers to make an animation. I assume they should be more sophisticated ways to do this with some other plugins.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/lQ0QUhfJdPHjn17GDFcq7swGf1kDKKBOuSW1CG3qTLlSS8F4ZX6COrgLl5R7nQ*1UpRG3etqs2RnZK*DNnJugxc0IsvsR8Wh/output_XsVcZC.gif\" width=\"620\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/lQ0QUhfJdPHjn17GDFcq7swGf1kDKKBOuSW1CG3qTLlSS8F4ZX6COrgLl5R7nQ*1UpRG3etqs2RnZK*DNnJugxc0IsvsR8Wh/output_XsVcZC.gif)\n\n\n\n\n\nRight click and animate the slider in the attached file and it will capture top and perspective views for first day of the year for few hours of the day.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1214929", "name": "animateSunPath.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 31, 2015 at 8:03am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nExcellent, that is exactly what I was thinking.\n\n\n\nThank you very much Mostapha!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 31, 2015 at 8:05am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}]}]}
