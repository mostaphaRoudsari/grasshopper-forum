{"body": "\nDear Mostapha and Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you and your colleagues for the amazing LB+HB tools, tutorials and example files.\n\n<br/> Although I'm new in using the tools, I have to make a complex model. Attached you can find my initial files, reports and errors (Running E+ simulation on the initial setup took hours and ended up with numerous errors)\u00a0\n\n<br/> I got a number of questions and would appreciate if you could answer them:\n\n\n\n1- I have duplicated zones using \"Honeybee Move\". Is this the correct way to duplicate zones and if yes, should I rename all surfaces afterwards? I have renamed zones but not surfaces (The tower has 40 floors = 10 x typical group of 4 floors)\u00a0\n\n\n\n2- Should I convert all curvilinear objects to faceted geometry (or only windows and window-walls should be flat)?\n\n\n\n3- In the next stage, I will add a second skin as the outer facade. Spiral structural elements (insulated thermal mass) are between interior and exterior areas, partly exposed to the sun. Should I split both interior and exterior zones to subtract these elements, and then solve the adjacencies?\n\n\n\n4- To simplify the procedure and make it faster, I may simulate only 4 floors. Is it possible to force-hide the top roof and the lowest floor from the sun and other environmental factors? If yes, how? and do you know how much accuracy in the results would be lost in this case?\u00a0<br/> <br/> 5- The outer skin would be all in glass, therefore in reality, the direct sun will affect the inner skin and\u00a0the structural elements. I read somewhere that in HB+E+ simulations, direct sun turns to diffuse after passing the first layer of glass. Is that true? If yes, how can I make the inner skin exposed to direct sun in the simulation?\u00a0<br/> <br/> Thank you very much for your time.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nAryan\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br/> \u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1542131", "name": "HB Test aryan008.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1542132", "name": "ary_AbuDhabi_Alt6_003_HB test 008.rar"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1542133", "name": "HB AbuDhabi 01.rar"}], "created_by_name": "Aryan Shahabian", "created_at": "June 4, 2016 at 3:07pm", "created_by": "AryanShahabian", "topic": "Energy modeling of a cylindrical tall building with diagrid structural thermal mass", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi again!\u00a0\n\n<br/>No one has replied to my questions.
