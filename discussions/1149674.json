{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha,\n\nI can make HDR but cannot make the false color HDR in the same file; besides, the false color works in other files. \u00a0Could you help me to check that?\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, one geometry I tried seems like it creates the HDR, but the image is totally white. I am not sure if the cause is from geometry, and if there any limitation to test the geometry in glare analysis.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nHui Ling\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1149671", "name": "1015_TEST_SHAD_Inno_GLARE_ques.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1149672", "name": "1015 Test_3 models_ques.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1149673", "name": "1015_IMG glare_ques.gh"}], "created_by_name": "HUI-LING CHANG", "created_at": "October 15, 2014 at 9:19pm", "created_by": "HUILINGCHANG", "topic": "Cannot get false color HDR image", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Hui Ling,\n\nYou had an extra Enter after your input for \"lux\". If you remove that FalseColor image will be produced (attached!).\n\n\n\nI cannot re-produce the issue with white image. It is usually a result of high exposure which can be set with setting setExposure to True which I can see that you already did. Can you send me the weather file that you are using?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/6q4t4dNL56kOBcBt66*mXVx-Bd2NJOmW8ddE9iHWf85oKi7QjvzAALhAyXa3HiuWjUXRbeF9618MIom01SBXdsZ4G4Syq*Xh/GlareAndFalseColor.png\" width=\"699\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/6q4t4dNL56kOBcBt66*mXVx-Bd2NJOmW8ddE9iHWf85oKi7QjvzAALhAyXa3HiuWjUXRbeF9618MIom01SBXdsZ4G4Syq*Xh/GlareAndFalseColor.png)\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1149687", "name": "1015_IMGglare_ques_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 16, 2014 at 12:01am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nOh, I got it, and thank you.\n\nThe weather file is from California climate zone 6, and please see the attachment.\n\n\n\nHui Ling\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1149745", "name": "CZ06RV2.epw"}], "created_by_name": "HUI-LING CHANG", "created_at": "October 16, 2014 at 2:01am", "created_by": "HUILINGCHANG", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nTwo quick comments about your file:\n\n1. Set RADParameters higher in case this is your final analysis. The parameters are pretty low for what you are trying to do. You can see that in the quality of the image.\n\n2.
