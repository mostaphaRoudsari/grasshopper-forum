The tolerance in your Rhino file is very high which causes the issue. For example there is a case that the window is outside the wall (image below) but since the difference is less then the tolerance Honeybee considers the surface to be on the wall but then it will cause issues when it tries to split the window from the wall.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/088*6UBF7TAo-Ae7tvjav-Sdz6DdkU9ca7I8et*3ROfocnI0NogW1fGTHDeZDlkPP78XxXsWnEL3wzKHQx7m56z4zj-SxZqC/missed_window.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/088*6UBF7TAo-Ae7tvjav-Sdz6DdkU9ca7I8et*3ROfocnI0NogW1fGTHDeZDlkPP78XxXsWnEL3wzKHQx7m56z4zj-SxZqC/missed_window.JPG)\n\nBeing planar is also relative to tolerance. As Claudio mentioned Radiance needs planar surfaces with accuracy of 10^-6 of the unit. The tolerance in your model is 0.1 which means a surface can be planar in your model but won't be planar from Radiance point of you. In many cases you can disregard the warning but in your case it's causing issue with exporting the geometry.\n\n\n\nMy suggestion is to redraw your model with a smaller tolerance value. That will solve many of the issues. If you set the tolerance to 0.01 and re-run the Grasshopper you'll see that many of windows will be missing which needs to be fixed by redrawing the windows or the wall or both.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 7, 2016 at 5:27pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha!\n\nThanks a lot for your big big\u00a0help. i really needed it!!\n\nI\u00b4ve changed the absolute and relative tollerance of the unit, and i rebuilt all the windows, making copy-InPlace and scale1D to obtain the windows from the walls.\n\nThe strange thing now is that i still have only one window that daesn\u00b4t work and i don\u00b4t know why :(\n\nAnd moreover unfortunatly now i have also energy problem (that i\u00a0hadn\u00b4t before)\u00a0with the simulation because i obtain this severe error:\n\n\"GetHTSubSurfaceData: Surface Openings have too much area for base surface=A_0_GLZP_1\".\n\nI checked in the idf that surface and i build it in\u00a0gh from the vertex but it\u00b4s a big surface that i don\u00b4t know from where the program gets it!\n\nHere i upload the files , can you elp me?

Set the tolerance to 0.001 and re-run the Grasshopper script. Energy simulation runs fine on my machine.\n\nTo avoid issues with single windows in your example I suggest to break down the very long walls with multiple windows into smaller pieces in Rhino. You can use splitFace command and draw some vertical lines between them. That will make meshing much easier for Honeybee.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 10, 2016 at 11:57am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nthanks a lot for you help!
