Honeybee has a component that helps you with that however you can do similar operations using Grasshopper native components.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/N7*qQ6E0U5LYedoJPtbaVy6iKhgvhrB1gWq8Mc-kpHuiVcHRaRiE-S5GdegepjgoA3MmNJ3JUapEn59O-S77iB*coqhDI58d/intersectMasses.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/N7*qQ6E0U5LYedoJPtbaVy6iKhgvhrB1gWq8Mc-kpHuiVcHRaRiE-S5GdegepjgoA3MmNJ3JUapEn59O-S77iB*coqhDI58d/intersectMasses.png)\n\n\n\nCheck the attached file for a slightly modified file. I connected 2 zones so you can see how it works. Do NOT graft the zones randomly. you want all the zones to go through solveAdjacency in the same branch.\n\n\n\nMostapha\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1173489", "name": "ZoneModel_2_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 21, 2014 at 10:37pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nMostapha,\n\n\n\nI got it figured out, thanks for the help.

Some of the schedules are assigned to none in OpenStudio and should be solved once we update the schedules. I saw that you posted another discussion for the same issue.
