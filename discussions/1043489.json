{"body": "\nHi to everyone,\n\n\n\nin this tutorial (\u00a0[http://diva4rhino.com/page/simulating-luminaires-with-ies-files](http://diva4rhino.com/page/simulating-luminaires-with-ies-files)\u00a0) is shown a method to simulate a lamp in DIVA. Considering that the process is about a modding of radiance materials, do you think that it would be possible to do the same in honeybee?\n\n\n\nTo go deeper I have tried to do the tutorial about DIVA, but in its grasshopper version: it doesn't work. To be more precise, the material, applied to a brep, is not read by the\u00a0**DIVA\u00a0****daylight simulator.**\u00a0Actually I don't know if I'm mistaken about some details.\n\n\n\nit would be great if only it could be possible in honeybee! for instance I have found this study which is pretty interesting to calculate lamps power consumptions directly in honeybee:\u00a0[https://sites.google.com/site/just4architecture/research/responsive...](https://sites.google.com/site/just4architecture/research/responsive-lighting-system)\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nClaudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "April 13, 2014 at 1:07pm", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "topic": "Simulating IES lamps file through RAD materials", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\n\n\nThank you for sharing the links. Similar approach can be applied to Honeybee however it is not currently implemented. I personally don't want to implement lighting simulation to Honeybee at this point. So much can go wrong there for inexperienced users.\n\n\n\nI saw your discussion on DIVA page and I'm pretty sure Alstan will have a solution for that. Keep me posted about the results. If you really need it for your studies I can apply it to Honeybee over the next weekend.\n\n\n\nTuan's work is also pretty interesting. Thanks for sharing. I wish I could read more details about his project.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 13, 2014 at 4:24pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nFirst try:\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LWw0InctTwnuJ0CGHuuw5bfZVFZj*bHr9QR*nTmPoG9UfaGLuT4gAZz3qxM*URyC7oJ042oQN11NQHnKvbJzyoBrIwySjtUx/IES2HB.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/LWw0InctTwnuJ0CGHuuw5bfZVFZj*bHr9QR*nTmPoG9UfaGLuT4gAZz3qxM*URyC7oJ042oQN11NQHnKvbJzyoBrIwySjtUx/IES2HB.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 17, 2014 at 11:33pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\nCheck the attached file for the WIP component.
