{"body": "\nHey All!\n\nI have solved adjacencies of two zones (one on top of the other, as parts of a double-skin facade) with AIR WALL as alt-Construction, and Adiabatic as alt-Boundary-Condition. I'd appreciate if someone could explain the behavior of such surfaces in terms of heat transfer as well as causing shading effect on other objects.\n\nI guess such surfaces should let the sun in, while not letting heat transfer between their two sides. Is that correct?\n\nBest,<br/> Aryan\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aryan Shahabian", "created_at": "June 13, 2016 at 12:58pm", "created_by": "AryanShahabian", "topic": "Solve Adjacencies with AIR WALL + Adiabatic", "replies": []}
