{"body": "\nHey All,\n\nUsing the HB_Make_Adiabatic I changed a surface boundary condition from outdoors to adiabatic. Afterwards I moved the containing zone using HB_Move_HB but then I realized that the adiabatic boundary condition is lost and the surface has turned back to its previous state (outdoors).\n\nIs there any way to preserve the altered boundary conditions while moving zones? (I use HB_Move_HB in order to duplicate zones in a large model)\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nAryan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aryan Shahabian", "created_at": "June 13, 2016 at 7:46am", "created_by": "AryanShahabian", "topic": "Boundary condition changes after moving", "replies": [{"body": "\nThis is expected. Honeybee overwrites the boundary condition for the moved objects. I see your point though. Maybe we should only overwrite the boundary condition if it is set to another surface and otherwise keep it similar to the source object.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 13, 2016 at 7:51am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks for your prompt reply. It would be great if you could add that option to the HB_Move_HB component.
