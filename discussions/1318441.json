{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI recently updated the Honeybee and Ladybug modules for Github. In running the 'Honeybee_Run DaylightSimulation' module I encountered a problem. It runs fine when using grid-based analysis recipes. When using an annual based recipe (DAYSIM) run, I receive an error:\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2WnXz*FVOuGtFF1iD942bmF8Wq6W-Ori59IOptN9-C7tZ9r-6rgvogTU9ZwKjceH*nGVGcOiYtjFRkuPqaB9gvCTl2cks69E/Error.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2WnXz*FVOuGtFF1iD942bmF8Wq6W-Ori59IOptN9-C7tZ9r-6rgvogTU9ZwKjceH*nGVGcOiYtjFRkuPqaB9gvCTl2cks69E/Error.PNG)\n\n\n\nThis module had worked previously before the most recent update.\n\n\n\nPerhaps there is a bug with one of the updated modules? Please let me know your thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\nReinhardt\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reinhardt Swart", "created_at": "June 30, 2015 at 5:20pm", "created_by": "ReinhardtSwart", "topic": "Possible Bug - New Honeybee Run Daylight Simulation Module - 03.16.15", "replies": [{"body": "\nReinhardt,\n\nIt seems that the error is probably linked to the number of CPUs that you are inputting into the run daylight simulation component as this seems to be the line where things are failing:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2WnXz*FVOuEafgOIiR8Hn9KK6ZYN4dheBuP6HkHnVP7M0UQoFvM*d-vmkhJ0okyvlIOIr59aPdaX7RcFyXWngmat1hIvP8E9/FilureLine.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2WnXz*FVOuEafgOIiR8Hn9KK6ZYN4dheBuP6HkHnVP7M0UQoFvM*d-vmkhJ0okyvlIOIr59aPdaX7RcFyXWngmat1hIvP8E9/FilureLine.PNG)\n\n\n\nI fixed a bug in the cpu count a while ago:\n\n([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/32582b2d2686d29...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/32582b2d2686d29c459d4faf48f3f630da83a141))\n\nThis may have triggered another bug that you have discovered here. \u00a0Could you upload your GH file complete with the number of cpus that you are using? \u00a0Could you also let us know the number of logical processors on your machine.\n\n\n\nThanks for finding this,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 30, 2015 at 6:39pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\n\nThanks for the prompt reply. I looked into the the CPU count. I am running 8 CPUs which hasn't been a problem in the past. However, I am also testing only 1 test point (for a quick turnaround). When this happens, the annual simulation does not work. When I changed the grid count to be greater than 8, the annual simulation ran.\n\n\n\nIt appears it does have something to do with exactly what you stated above. Let me know if that helps.\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nReinhardt\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reinhardt Swart", "created_at": "July 1, 2015 at 7:14am", "created_by": "ReinhardtSwart", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nReinhardt,\n\nAll of this definitely helps. \u00a0If you could upload your GH file so that I don't have to re-create the case of failure myself, I can fix the issue more quickly.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 1, 2015 at 2:06pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Reinhardt, I could replicate the error and Chris is right about the cause.
