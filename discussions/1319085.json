Sometimes tolerance settings were not correct and my joined surfaces were not considered joined. You can try playing around with that.\n\n\n\nThe other reasons were pretty much covered by Mostapha and Chris. Usually you want AB (the ambient bounces) to be greater or equal to 5 no matter the quality, as it is one of the most important variables for a dependable simulation. Of course it depends on the nature of your geometry but 5 min. is a safe bet.\n\n\n\nBtw, I couldn't see which geometry you are plugging where as one pipeline was empty in the file you posted when I opened it. Could it be that you forgot a surface?\n\n\n\nAnother point is the unit range you are using. Is that really 10 lux as maximum in your picture? Because in that case it makes sense for everything to be yellow (inside and outside) as you most likely will have more than 10 lux everywhere.\n\n\n\nP.S.: Selecting medium/high quality sets all the variables for you, no need for additional sliders. In your case you are actually overwriting the quality settings.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "July 18, 2015 at 9:04pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Theodoros Galanos,\n\n\n\nThanks!
