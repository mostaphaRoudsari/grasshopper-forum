{"body": "\n**Hello everyone!**\n\n\n\nFirst of all many compliments for this two great tools you created (LB &amp; HB), they've changed my way of running my simulations and are therefore very very useful.\n\n\n\nI'm experiencing a problem though when trying to set a daylight simulation with some determined radiance parameters. Here's the problem: After many tries I think I found out that setting -ab = 6 and at the same time -aa = .05 creates some sort of problem, because when I try to do so My PC blocks for several minutes, without letting me manually end processes from taskmanager, and when I'm able again to enter grasshopper, i get the following error:\n\n\"Solution exception:index out of range: 0\"\n\nDoes this really depends on the parameters and values I found out or is it related to something else? Is the problem relative to the structure of HoneyBee or is it just relative to my specific case (and maybe PC)? Is it possible to solve it, and if yes, how?\n\n\n\nAtteched you find my rhino model and my grasshopper file.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for your help and again many compliments!\n\nLuigi\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1423949", "name": "Office_Model_1.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1423950", "name": "Model For honeybee_2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Luigi Giovannini", "created_at": "December 19, 2015 at 11:35am", "created_by": "LuigiGiovannini", "topic": "HoneyBee reports error with some Radiance parameters", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ligui,\n\nYour model is ok and I could run it properly.
