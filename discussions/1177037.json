{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI have received this question couple of times and I'm not sure if I know the answer.\n\n\n\nMy suggestion is usually to use Green Building Studio for energy modeling, and then download the .idf file from GBS and import it into Honeybee using importIdf knowing that importIDF just imports the geometry and you need to import materials, constructions, and schedules separately so it is not fun at all.\n\n\n\nI don't know how many users are using REVIT &gt; Honeybee workflow but if it is a common workflow then we should get importIdf fixed soon.\n\n\n\nAnybody on the list has a better solution that they use?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 27, 2014 at 9:56pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "topic": "What is the best practice to import Revit models for energy modeling with Honeybee?", "replies": [{"body": "\nThis is a really good question!\n\nI have tried using Chameleon (a plugin for both Revit and GH), that allow importing gb.xml files exported from Revit. The problem is often the import of the model is not that good. It is limited to only import the simple energy model geometry.\n\nThere is also a connection from CASE, that export Rooms from Revit to GH directly. But I have never tried it. As seen in the linked video, it only transfer the geometry, no windows or noting: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zclpoUUqSlk&amp;list=UUqJXNsH0Tx1U2...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zclpoUUqSlk&amp;list=UUqJXNsH0Tx1U2WaDddCGR9Q)\n\nA basic problem when exporting energy models from Revit is that, the models is typical not that good. In many cases there is a lot of smal air gabs and other strange things in the export. In fact this is also a issue when running energy simulations within Revit with GBS.\n\nWhy would people try to export and import models in GH with all properties? Knowing the settings in Revit is really limited. Only the constructions could be nice to have in the import to Honeybee, or?\n\nIs it to get a more accurate result, or to use the benefit of Honeybee and GH's parametric possibilities? If so, is it needed to have all properties added in Revit?\n\nWhat I have done more often is importing these simple xml models into GH for running daylight simulations. Instead of export a whole detailed model. Because the numbers of surfaces determines the simulation speed therefore a more zone model is much better.\n\n/daniel\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "daniel nielsen", "created_at": "November 28, 2014 at 10:19am", "created_by": "arkdanielnielsen", "replies": [{"body": "\nI just remembered a other crazy way of creating a better energy model based on Rooms.

It is usually supposed to carry the data but in reality it doesn't! At least output from Revit/Vasari doesn't include data for constructions. The one that you can download from GBS does. This project came out recently that should ease the process of converting xml &lt;&gt; idf to each other:\u00a0[https://github.com/MarcusJones/EnergyParser](https://github.com/MarcusJones/EnergyParser)\n\n\n\nYou are right about the gap and I can also see that in the model that you posted on github.\n\n\n\nWell, I'm not sure why people do it but maybe since it is easier to customize your model with Honeybee, or visualize the results.\n\n\n\nFor now I fixed idfImport component so one can import idf file as Honeybee objects, modify the model and run it in Grasshopper and visualize the results. In this example I change construction for glazing. The process doesn't input data related to systems. It imports geometry, materials and constructions. It imports schedules but don't assign them to zones. That should be an easy fix for later.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/alJLWH62eMTWJhyCFI28pirIrglfe2vJsKdcoY4jH9HzLK6V-l9pjp1gxOua0DfnFRnksbyerG952mNyiLL8yx4hl0aAyVlV/importIdf_toHoneybee.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/alJLWH62eMTWJhyCFI28pirIrglfe2vJsKdcoY4jH9HzLK6V-l9pjp1gxOua0DfnFRnksbyerG952mNyiLL8yx4hl0aAyVlV/importIdf_toHoneybee.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1177807", "name": "importIdf.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 29, 2014 at 12:52pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nAlso you are right.
