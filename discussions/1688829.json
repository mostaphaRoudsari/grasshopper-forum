{"body": "\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I am recently involved a LEED V4 NC project. During the process, I found LEED V4's daylighting simulation has been changed. According to my knowledge ,I knew that Honeybee for Grasshooper can calculate the Useful Daylighting illuminance.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 After studied the Honeybee_Annual_Daylight_Simulation_Example form ([http://hydrashare.github.io](http://hydrashare.github.io)), I got the UDLI &lt;100,100&lt; UDLI &lt;2000 and UDLI &gt;2000 .This example is performed very nice.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 But the requirement of LEED V4 EQ CREDIT: DAYLIGHT Option 2 need illuminance levels will be between 300 lux and 3,000 lux for 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 So I am confused. Is the any method for Honeybee to \u00a0do this level of illuminance calculations?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1688826", "name": "LEED V4 requirement.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1688827", "name": "Honeybee_Annual_Daylight_Simulation_Example_GH.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1688828", "name": "Honeybee_Annual_Daylight_Simulation_Example.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Minggang Yin", "created_at": "February 10, 2017 at 12:02am", "created_by": "minggangyin", "topic": "LEED V4 Illuminance Calculations", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi,\n\nGrid based simulation shall be used for such point in time analysis.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "February 10, 2017 at 12:32am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "\nSample attached.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1688767", "name": "Daylight_Simple.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "February 10, 2017 at 2:14am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}]}]}
