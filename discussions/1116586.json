{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI ve been using Ladybug to run some Radiation Analysis,\n\nFor some dates, (not all of them), there seems to be some issue with the legend not showing up when I set the Analysis period to be same day from morning till night.\n\nOnly the lowest value of the legend appears.\n\n\n\nThe analysis seems to be running fine, judging from the gradient of the colors.\n\n\n\nIn this particular example the legend appears for Dec 22nd from 06.00-22.00 but not for other dates like Dec 21 same time period. Sky appears also to be just one color whenever the problem occurs.\n\n\n\nI attach the files for your reference.\n\nThanks a lot,\n\nDimitris\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1116584", "name": "Radiation_Img_01.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1116585", "name": "####_Radiation_Analysis_2014_0813.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "August 14, 2014 at 1:08pm", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Ladybug Radiation Analysis Legend not appearing", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 15, 2014 at 6:53am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for the response!\n\nI assumed it had to do something with the setting in the range of the values but wasn't sure what.\n\nI ll use fixed min/max values for the time being.\n\n\n\nThanks again!\n\nDimitris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "August 15, 2014 at 7:32am", "created_by": "doompop", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nAdded to github: ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/77](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/77)).
