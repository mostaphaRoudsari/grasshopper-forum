{"body": "\nHello Forum, I am curious how to treat a glass balustrade/handrail as context for solar radiation analysis. Certainly the balustrade will filter the solar radiation but not block it completely... As such, how should I handle this architectural element in a solar radiation analysis using ladybug?
