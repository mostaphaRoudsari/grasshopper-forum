{"body": "\nAs of a few hours ago, I can no longer conduct radiation analyses through Ladybug. The problem seems similar to the previous post by GB, except I have not received an error message. Instead, everything looks normal except that no matter how I change the parameters or flip the surfaces, every surface is registering as 0 kWh/m2 (as seen below). I've tried multiple files (including files that worked fine yesterday) but I always get the same result.<br/> <br/> I've attached all my files below. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/aDnEqQYbuL-gYySHaba7zTgeEftmXSJVmATbAIPhAa78f3eG-H9ZI*UM5AR9*spirnD*aldQcU33rgARz*c2d4ivR8pZKvHr/mass.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/aDnEqQYbuL-gYySHaba7zTgeEftmXSJVmATbAIPhAa78f3eG-H9ZI*UM5AR9*spirnD*aldQcU33rgARz*c2d4ivR8pZKvHr/mass.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1139813", "name": "Mass.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1139814", "name": "Mass.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1139815", "name": "USA_OH_Cincinnati.Muni.AP-Lunken.Field.724297_TMY3.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Caleb Wild", "created_at": "September 30, 2014 at 12:24am", "created_by": "CalebWild", "topic": "Problem with Radiation Analysis", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Caleb,\n\nSimple: You just need to insert LB_LB component and let it fly.
