{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm unsure about oppening a new discussion or add to an existing one (Revit import). Decided to add a new one, though they are related for my workflow.\n\ni have an IDF file created with my own software. Trying to import using the IDF fails to import all definitions and as a result the simulation fails in HB. The specific items that are not imported relate to Shading Control on windows (Blinds or shades). Attached my original file (SingleOfficeTest). I used Mostapha's recent example (importIdf.gh) for the test. Deleting from the idf the shading control definitions let the simulation to work.\n\nThe second issue relates to the setEPZoneThresholds component. When you hook Cooling/Heating setpoint temperatures it fails to work complaining about **1. Solution exception:List**\n\n\n\nAs usual: I'm missing something or there is a problem?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1178044", "name": "SingleOffice4Test.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 30, 2014 at 1:02am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "idf import and setEPZoneThresholds issues", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Abraham, Of course you will find a bug in less than 24 hours! ;) Thanks-\n\n\n\nYou are right!
