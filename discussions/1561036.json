{"body": "\nFor a certain project, I needed to create a monthly line chart instead of the default bar chart that LB - Make Bar Chart component creates. The way to do it was use the data label pts output and put it into a polyline GH component. Firstly,it would be helpful to have that option within the component?\u00a0\n\nBut the problem I was facing was that since the dataLabelPts is really to add data labels, it had an factor added to move the labels above the bar charts (image : 1.jpg) . Since I wanted to depict the line chart with exact values, I removed the factor (+(yS/conversionFac) ) from the python script and it worked. (image : 2.jpeg)\n\nI am thinking if this would be worth incorporating into the component?\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1561034", "name": "1.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1561035", "name": "2.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Apoorv Goyal", "created_at": "July 6, 2016 at 7:50am", "created_by": "ApoorvGoyal", "topic": "Line Graphs from Bar Chart Component", "replies": [{"body": "\nI would add this to github so Chris can take a look and implement it if he agrees with your comments.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 11, 2016 at 11:14am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nApoorv,\n\nI like the suggestion and I apologize for the late reply. \u00a0I will implement this option now while I am fixing a bug that was found on the component.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 1, 2016 at 10:15am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nApoorv,\n\nYour request has been implemented:\u00a0\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/c60940d066d8c411...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/c60940d066d8c4118c94e4a6120ebe22539c50f8)\n\nSync with the github to get the new component and let me know if the new _labelPtsOffset_ input behaves in the way you imagined.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 1, 2016 at 12:51pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}]}
