{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\n\u00a0I am trying to understand how the lenght of a paramtric dynamic louver affects the lux value on a test surface; the issue I'm facing is that everytime I change the louver lenght HoneeyBee starts a new analysis and this process will take too much time.\n\nThe final target is to find (with Galapagos) the best lenght of the louver to guarantee an average lux value on the surface (this part in not yey inserted in the definition).\n\n\n\nSo the question is, is there a way to change the louver lenght and obtain the different grid results without HoneyBee starting a new analysis? (maybe by calculating some sort of matrix?)\n\n\n\nI attachg the .gh definition and the Weater file (the weater file is not essential, you can use one that you already have to test the algorithm).\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nDavide.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1795506", "name": "ITA_Treviso-Volpago del Montello.epw"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1795507", "name": "Parametric dynamic shading.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Davide Girardi", "created_at": "August 8, 2017 at 9:14am", "created_by": "DavideGirardi", "topic": "Change shading geometry without re-doing the analysis", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Davide,\n\n\n\nDid you try to disable the analysis before changing louvers length?\u00a0\n\nBy doing so, it won't run calculations every time you change something and will make you save a lot of time...\n\nFammi sapere se qualcosa non ti \u00e9 chiaro!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nSimone\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Simone Bevilacqua", "created_at": "August 8, 2017 at 12:46pm", "created_by": "SimoneBevilacqua", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Simone,\n\nthe problem is that if I disable the analysis before changing the geometry i won't have no more the grid points with the lux values.\n\nWhat I wish to do is changing part of the geometry (the dynamic louvers only) and still obtain the grid point results without re-running the analysis.\n\n\n\nBest,\u00a0\n\nDavide.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Davide Girardi", "created_at": "August 9, 2017 at 1:33am", "created_by": "DavideGirardi", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nNo option but run the analysis.\n\nWhat you can do to save time is to save the simulation results and just call them from where they are stored.
