You need to render the images for different hours one by one. You can write them into different folders and then run the glare analysis for each of them.\n\n2. Glare is view based. You will get one value for each view/image. Adding or removing zones doesn't change the number of views. You can connect a list of view names to image analysis component and it will generate a separate image for each view and you'll get a different DGI for each image.\n\n3. It is possible to set up and run annual glare analysis (which will give you DGP and not DGI BTW) but make sure to cross check the results for point in time analysis. If you search for annual glare analysis and you'll find a number of discussions.\n\n4. Yes. You can but again as I said zone is a concept for energy simulation and doesn't have anything to do with glare analysis.\n\n5.

I am using 'annual daylight simulation' component to analysis annual glare of multiple zones. As you told me that glare is view based. And I also connected multiple points to the 'set the view' component to set the views. But when i analysis the glare of two zones, the list of the result i got is three. The more than three zones, the result is also three lists. Is it because i don't set multiple names to the 'the Rhino views name' of the 'DS Parameter' component. I don't know why this problem occur. And don't know what to do whit this. Can you give me some suggestions.\n\nBest regards!\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hang Chen", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 2:52am", "created_by": "HangChen", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha.\n\nCan you help me to check the gh file, which i used to simulate annual glare analysis.
