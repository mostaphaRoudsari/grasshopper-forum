{"body": "\nHello Mustapha and and whole LB + HB team. This is amazing and I am very excited to have access to these tools so thanks!\n\n\n\nI am working through Chris Mackey's youtube videos and working up a current design that I am developing. I am trying to get the adjacent surfaces to solve properly and am having some issues. You can see in the screen shot below the issue seems to be at the clerestory where zones central to the plan access the split between the roof planes to bring in natural light. The adjacency tool doesn't want to split the wall into interior and exterior surfaces. Any suggestions? Thanks!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1447285", "name": "adjacencies 2.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1447286", "name": "adjacencies 1.png"}], "created_by_name": "Naryn Davar", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 7:33am", "created_by": "NarynDavar", "topic": "Issues With Adjacent Zone Surfaces", "replies": [{"body": "\nAlthough now my energy model returns these errors... so I'll keep working on it.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zANsye7pDab6PII1YMHDs-sH-tYOtUZ68P30vt3ykhCW15emuZDHeVxdZlQYWn03nZZFEycSdwCN3zsbv42VGZYjYwjBffYk/adjacencies3.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zANsye7pDab6PII1YMHDs-sH-tYOtUZ68P30vt3ykhCW15emuZDHeVxdZlQYWn03nZZFEycSdwCN3zsbv42VGZYjYwjBffYk/adjacencies3.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Naryn Davar", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 9:28am", "created_by": "NarynDavar", "replies": [{"body": "\nFor some reason the intersect masses component introduced the above issues.
