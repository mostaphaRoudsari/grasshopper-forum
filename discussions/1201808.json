Some weeks ago, I tried to create an emodel of considerable size using OS in Sketchup and after a little bit the geometry handling became pretty messy and unstable.

Very educational and well made.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI managed to run a few simulations on a quite complicated model very fast using your videos.\n\n\n\nI was wondering if there are more coming (as you can imagine no amount of new exciting knowledge is enough for us!). Of course, I realize that, much like Mostapha and Chris, this is out of your free time.\n\n\n\nI wonder if I can put some odd questions here (warning: might be dumb).\n\n\n\n- Is it possible to have non airconditioned spaces within the model? I tried bypassing the OS Systems component and link directly to the simulation component but that only applied ideal air loads to the zones.\n\n- Is it possible to have multiple systems within the same model? If yes, should I just use multiple OS Systems and PlantDesigner components for each system?\n\n- If I want to model multiple (e.g. 3) AHU for one floor, should I also use 3x AHU components and link the zones that each unit is supplying air too (duh)? Or will that not really improve accuracy of design.\n\n- Is it possible to have just mechanical ventilation and not aircondition systems (e.g. Warehouse spaces)? If yes, do I just leave the plant details empty?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for any response.\n\n\n\nWish you good luck with your research!

You need to set isConditioned to False and also bypass the systems as you mentioned.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to have multiple systems within the same model? If yes, should I just use multiple OS Systems and PlantDesigner components for each system?\n\nYes.
