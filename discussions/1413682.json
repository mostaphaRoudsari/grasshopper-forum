You need to fork the repository which you already have.\n\n2. You need to sync your branch with master. Currently your fork is 194 commits behind. You can use compare to update your branch.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ywz7TbLyhfyhSV2yz8WB*b4TxdsZzMlQLg5cW3d4Ejvjn*elXRlezJfHdRPiD23nQPhcHZHmw9Yh-ji2qJtuZpe8Av*z5WJg/updateBranch.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ywz7TbLyhfyhSV2yz8WB*b4TxdsZzMlQLg5cW3d4Ejvjn*elXRlezJfHdRPiD23nQPhcHZHmw9Yh-ji2qJtuZpe8Av*z5WJg/updateBranch.JPG)\n\n3. After that is covered in this video - minute 23:30. You need to use export Ladybug component which will export .py and .userobject to the folder. Then you can use the normal process with github to push it to your fork and send a PR.\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"475\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_m5PDqv5pU?list=PLkjfDmSc5Orxq-f_fbmu_HV4tE2ZPIdaC&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"475\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 2, 2015 at 4:07pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nMostapha, thanks for the example.
