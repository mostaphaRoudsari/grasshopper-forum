{"body": "\nHi All!\n\n\n\nI'm testing out the use of the Thermal Autonomy component, however the prerequisite Microclimate Map Analysis component is not giving out any data.\n\nI've gone over my component inputs and am confused as to where I am going wrong.\n\n\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Please note that I have changed the coding to take 8.2 instead of 8.3 as our uni computers only have 8.2 for the moment\n\n\n\nPS. excuse my file, I am also playing with the parametric iterations for running several simulations at once.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fjCJhks0XLueaItAZXPvOwswzT2PCjoPf01uutf*cDbvbfjzgDPegJpzpU6jVblzvFmkhkoH8-C*9bpAmb8seYxauXEWDATp/AdaptiveComfortIssue.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fjCJhks0XLueaItAZXPvOwswzT2PCjoPf01uutf*cDbvbfjzgDPegJpzpU6jVblzvFmkhkoH8-C*9bpAmb8seYxauXEWDATp/AdaptiveComfortIssue.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1441164", "name": "Workflow_V1.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1441165", "name": "userCustomEPLibrary.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 18, 2016 at 3:10pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Error: Microclimate Map Analysis Component not producing data", "replies": [{"body": "\nElzine,\n\nI was able to run your file without any difficulties:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fjCJhks0XLsRQ5tTpzPUiD8pERAfpyHePWd7bKfpDJsCxilVH9tKhXcoXGAyeyRaO7pSU*Sd1h*QQNPzHeb7V9iVYuc0f3Z*/ThermalAutonomy.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fjCJhks0XLsRQ5tTpzPUiD8pERAfpyHePWd7bKfpDJsCxilVH9tKhXcoXGAyeyRaO7pSU*Sd1h*QQNPzHeb7V9iVYuc0f3Z*/ThermalAutonomy.JPG)\n\nI noticed that your grid size was originally very coarse, yielding only two test points for the zone but this did not stop the file from running correctly. \u00a0Do you remember the error that you got? \u00a0If you were running it on a computer that is not really built for parallel processing, it could have been the result of the parallel process failing. \u00a0Let me know if the attached file works and, if not, what the error message is.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1441305", "name": "Workflow_V1_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 18, 2016 at 9:34pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you for the quick response! Unfortunately I am still having the same issue, the error message says \"Solution Exception: Index out of range: 7\". As someone very new to coding, this error is alien to me...\n\n\n\nIn reassigning the inputs, I find that it only comes up with that error when I connect the HBZones. The computer is able to do parrallel processing, the only difference I might be able to note is that we have 8.2 and not 8.3 but I don't recall that being essential for this analysis...\n\n\n\nUnsure why my zones would cause an issue as well, since there is only one at this stage. I will experiment a bit more, but I donnot know what that error message is meaning.\n\n\n\nCheers, Elly\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 19, 2016 at 2:43pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nI got it working if I disconnected the \"Set Schedules\" component from the workflow... but that's not really ideal...\n\n\n\nIt isn't possible to create your own building templates yet the way we can add original schedules?
