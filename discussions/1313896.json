{"body": "\nIn the attached GH file, a HBSrf is created as **UndergroundSlab** using the **createHBSrfs** component.\n\n\n\nHowever, it is recognized as a **groundFloors** surface rather than a **undergroundSlabs** surface using the **Decompose Based on Type** component.\n\n\n\nMay I ask why it is like this? What is the difference between **groundFloors** and **undergroundSlabs** surfaces?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-HoKvkav3szwCL4FF7hH9sFOIaqzpfQB5-ESg0yA*SzzfkzIBubU9v4bSd6U8hpMm*GLIVPOQw0aG1v3cWm-8q9CgWMTxpG7/01.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-HoKvkav3szwCL4FF7hH9sFOIaqzpfQB5-ESg0yA*SzzfkzIBubU9v4bSd6U8hpMm*GLIVPOQw0aG1v3cWm-8q9CgWMTxpG7/01.PNG)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-HoKvkav3szsg5mNh3-8sK8HS43ghKwQGFB3ncQHokYaUdV3UYGWf8aUPyY4sWNdMxZrfI-coT8*NwI2UtB9oGsLlfIX6mn*/02.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-HoKvkav3szsg5mNh3-8sK8HS43ghKwQGFB3ncQHokYaUdV3UYGWf8aUPyY4sWNdMxZrfI-coT8*NwI2UtB9oGsLlfIX6mn*/02.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1313895", "name": "ZJ_Tut_13_HBSurf_v001.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "June 23, 2015 at 12:01am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "why UndergroundSlab HBSrf is recognized as groundFloors?", "replies": [{"body": "\nBy definition undergroundSlab is a roof which is underground.
