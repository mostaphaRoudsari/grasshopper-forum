Climate Based Sky is using\u00a0Radiance's gendaylit under the hood to generate a custom sky and right now it reads the values from the weather file but it is very easy to hack the component and input your own values. Do you know how to do that?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 29, 2015 at 2:30am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha!
