{"body": "\nHi Guys,\n\n\n\nRecently I`ve involved a project that need quite bit of analysis work, one of which is required to analysis interior temperature through a certain surface pattern, and glazing.\n\n\n\nI have been looking for what kind of analysis tools that i could use.\n\ni watched Mostapha`s workshop online here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqbCkjMYxdk&amp;index=4&amp;list=PL...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqbCkjMYxdk&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLkjfDmSc5OryXkWSt57ltJFU4qXD5ss1v)\n\n\n\nbut from my understanding, the turorial is about to anaylsis how much amount of dayligh come into a interior given certain materials. So that is where i become confused: **is it the interior temperature resaults come from daylight analysis, or energy analysis?**\n\n\n\nHence, is there someone could recommend me which tutoria i could refer to in order to get the interior temperature analysis. So i could move to further step, which is to discuss human comfortable temperature by means of changing surface pattern and glazing transparency ratio.\n\n\n\nThank you alot!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nLei\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lei  Yang", "created_at": "May 13, 2016 at 12:16am", "created_by": "LeiYang", "topic": "HB method consulting_Interior temperature analysis", "replies": [{"body": "\nEnergy analysis gives you surface temperatures.

Hope I could get it from the videos that you mentioned. BTW, I am trying to do a termal based render in visualization which will show accurately how much warm people will feel inside the building. is it acchievable with LB?\n\n\n\nThank you!!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nLei\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lei  Yang", "created_at": "May 15, 2016 at 6:12am", "created_by": "LeiYang", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nI got it.
