{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to simulate a bath, which is heated to 38 degrees celsius (100.4 F), to calculate the operative temperature and to understand how much the heat will affect a zone next to the bath.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo my question is, how can I apply a fixed temperature to a surface (floor heating maybe?)? And further, how to add a source of moisture.\n\n\n\nThank you!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zakaria Djebbara", "created_at": "April 5, 2016 at 2:34am", "created_by": "ZakariaDjebbara", "topic": "Simulate a bath", "replies": [], "id": "1501160"}
