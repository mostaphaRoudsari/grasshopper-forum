{"body": "\nHi everyone.\n\nI am simulate the annual DGP value of two views. I think I successfully solved the problem of the multiple view names, but I meet another problem. When I simulate the two views DGP, I got two branches. I checked the number found that one branch seems to be wrong, because the annual DGP value is all smaller than 0.02 and the values in the other branch is normal ranges from 0.033 to 1.\n\nIs anybody meet the same problem, how did you solve this problem.\n\nThanks a lot for advance.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1470373", "name": "DGP.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Hang Chen", "created_at": "February 24, 2016 at 5:33am", "created_by": "HangChen", "topic": "annual DGP value of two views", "replies": [{"body": "\nSorry for the silly question, but what DGP stands for?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "March 23, 2016 at 3:28am", "created_by": "Timur582", "replies": [{"body": "\n**D**aylight **G**lare **P**robability\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 23, 2016 at 3:50am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you, Abraham.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "March 23, 2016 at 6:07am", "created_by": "Timur582", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nDGP: Daylight Glare Probability; it's a common measurement used in glare analysis.\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Maria X", "created_at": "March 24, 2016 at 9:19pm", "created_by": "MariaX", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1470374"}
