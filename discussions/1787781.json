{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI am using Ladybug_ShadingDesigner to define overhang for a window. I tried to use shading designer from\u00a0[this](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Shading_Designer&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=8&amp;offset=-6069.575758411403,-1910.3967672448712)\u00a0hydra example. What I'm with is getting my context recognized.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SVnC9W7SBKSpGzS*m1812zrHmsU16TD85lf4Fpd9B9zitkqCGLH123ysj8AeqpsPR3NQj14kXB787TOnBc-fdYjmiUSJ81e4/ShadingDesigner.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SVnC9W7SBKSpGzS*m1812zrHmsU16TD85lf4Fpd9B9zitkqCGLH123ysj8AeqpsPR3NQj14kXB787TOnBc-fdYjmiUSJ81e4/ShadingDesigner.JPG)\n\nI believe the shading generated is not being influenced by the context geometry that I am supplying. Can anybody suggest what I am missing here? Any help is appreciated.\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1787780", "name": "ShadingDesigner.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "July 23, 2017 at 11:29am", "created_by": "devang", "topic": "Shading Designer Context not being recognized", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\n<br/>I think you can solve your problem in this way:\n\n1) you should make something like in the screenshot below. This is because of MeshRay component.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/lRmMARtgbReab2tHXzyUh3mBWFdK3MZqTlCPDf3XsjTx9anQ4pn8GwZMlS42zVcxrYdLGfd-wRa6OuzBsZnuGRI4eoah-MBo/testPoints.PNG?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/lRmMARtgbReab2tHXzyUh3mBWFdK3MZqTlCPDf3XsjTx9anQ4pn8GwZMlS42zVcxrYdLGfd-wRa6OuzBsZnuGRI4eoah-MBo/testPoints.PNG)\n\n2) basically \"4 true\" means that the window is obstructed. So you should use \"&lt;\" instead \"&lt;=\" and move a bit your obstruction to leave sufficient space to rays which comes from vertices of the window.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/lRmMARtgbRfEDAXxKZk4koF-cD5du20VTiPT76gP5bPaF3*m4oLveG3GEWldnxp1R9CXMWxJJ72cjFYYFRLZItjV13o6gaoJ/concept.PNG?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/lRmMARtgbRfEDAXxKZk4koF-cD5du20VTiPT76gP5bPaF3*m4oLveG3GEWldnxp1R9CXMWxJJ72cjFYYFRLZItjV13o6gaoJ/concept.PNG)<br/>Best,<br/>Antonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "July 23, 2017 at 3:17pm", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": [{"body": "\nIt reminds me something we are cooking Antonello ... :-)\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 23, 2017 at 3:35pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nI would be interested in what you both are collaborating on.\n\nThanks,\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "July 25, 2017 at 6:45am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Antonello,\n\n\n\nThank you for looking into this. I understand what you're saying. However, I am still struggling with this. I receive True values for all the intersections, which does not seem right.
