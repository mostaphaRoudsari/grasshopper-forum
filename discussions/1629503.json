In the list that you get, the items from index 4125 to index 4404 are for the month of December. You could check the same by using sunPositionInfo output I believe.\n\n\n\nDave\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "October 31, 2016 at 12:44pm", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nCan you share the file that or a screenshot of the problem?
