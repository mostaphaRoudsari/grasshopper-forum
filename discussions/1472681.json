{"body": "\n\n\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI am trying to validate the\u00a0**functionality**\u00a0of a conceptual\u00a0**shading**\u00a0device (**a**\u00a0**3D printed mashrabiya**) in terms of its daylight performance as part of my PhD thesis.\n\nThe screen is parametricly designed using Rhino and Grasshopper, as seen in below image and interior rendering.\n\nI just finished installing LB+HB and had been surfing many of the previous discussions and video tutorials that left my head spinning with all the great possibilities.\n\n\n\n**1**- In summery, would you recommend Ladybug or DIVA to run a simple simulation of a south facing - one room geometry with and without the shading device?\n\n**2**- Are there any beginners daylight performance examples you can recommend me to see and follow their logic? View analysis examples or Sun paths?\n\n**3**- What tool will create the summer and winter rooms views in the example attached?\n\n\n\nMany thanks in advance\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/eDHLdh4H65gCuTAMAA5*-t1WLfMRa0cnuGZy1skdLRYMH8h-uzo32UjNwmQcokaX3s3oKu5gvfMzWAy3XlC0gQqrQDIwv1af/VariableMemberThicknessElevation.jpg?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/eDHLdh4H65gCuTAMAA5*-t1WLfMRa0cnuGZy1skdLRYMH8h-uzo32UjNwmQcokaX3s3oKu5gvfMzWAy3XlC0gQqrQDIwv1af/VariableMemberThicknessElevation.jpg)\u00a0[<img class=\"align-left\" height=\"199\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/eDHLdh4H65j3QKHUwvO5Wvman6S*u9kaX7hqVWkNKlLuMDl*Gj*OFDFqeDUnUUvMhces3tTZf-h7PysTpdZ2jZ-oIy3JcOQO/1interiorwith3DPMashrabiya.jpg?width=300\" width=\"282\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/eDHLdh4H65j3QKHUwvO5Wvman6S*u9kaX7hqVWkNKlLuMDl*Gj*OFDFqeDUnUUvMhces3tTZf-h7PysTpdZ2jZ-oIy3JcOQO/1interiorwith3DPMashrabiya.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1472680", "name": "annual day light performance.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Nehal Almerbati", "created_at": "February 27, 2016 at 4:02am", "created_by": "NehalAlmerbati", "topic": "3D printed shading device daylight analysis", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Nehal,\n\n\n\nExamples posted on\u00a0[Hydrashare](https://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/index.html) should help you get started.\u00a0[This](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Honeybee_Image-based_Daylight_Analysis) is an example of an imaged simulation.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "February 27, 2016 at 10:27am", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": [{"body": "\n\n\nThank you Sarith, the Hydrashare example were really helpful.\u00a0\n\nN\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nehal Almerbati", "created_at": "February 28, 2016 at 8:09am", "created_by": "NehalAlmerbati", "replies": []}]}]}
