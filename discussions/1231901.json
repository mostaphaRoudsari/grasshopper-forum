{"body": "\nhello Guys,\n\nI need to simulate\u00a0\u00a0if the radiation relflected from a\u00a0high gloss fa\u00e7ade will affect the comfort of a person standing beside this fa\u00e7ade on the exterior side. I'm planning to use A EP simulation to get the mean Rad temperature from the reflective fa\u00e7ade and plug that to a Ladybug_Outdoor_Solar_Temperature_Adjustor. And from there plot with a UTCI from a LadyBug_Outdoor_comfort_Calculator.\n\n\n\nIS this the right way to go. Any suggestions\n\n\n\ncheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "February 25, 2015 at 8:09pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "Mean Rad Temperature how to get account for surface radiation from surroundings", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\nThis is a tough one right now. There is no simplified way that I know to calculate such a thing. At least not with Ladybug+Honeybee.\n\nThere are tools like RADTHERM ([http://www.thermoanalytics.com/products/radtherm](http://www.thermoanalytics.com/products/radtherm)) that you can use for such analysis.\n\nI know about an on-going development to model long-wave radiations using Radiance to model situations like this. Meanwhile I don't think you can run such an analysis with Ladybug+Honeybee.\n\nDo you confirm this Chris?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 1, 2015 at 10:35pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHello Mostapha.\n\n\n\nThank you for the link.
