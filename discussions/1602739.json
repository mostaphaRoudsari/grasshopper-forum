{"body": "\nHi, guys,\n\nI\u2019m starting to learn Honeybee and I\u2019m getting this error when I try to run one of the most basic simulations (with the component \u2018run daylight analysis\u2019). I\u2019m getting the following message:\n\n1.Solution exception: unable to find file 'C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\\radiancetest\\imageBasedSimulation\\error.log'.\n\nThe model was based on a youtube workshop by Mostapha (1/7). The file is so simple (I got stuck in the first video), but I\u2019m sending it attached anyway. Prior to this error, I got a message about gendaylit (I found the file and saved it in the proper folder).\n\nI\u2019m assuming that there might be some files that are missing in some folders. I never had such problems with Ladybug, only with Honeybee (eve though the message refers to the Ladybug folder).\n\nI appreciate your help!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1602738", "name": "honeybee-1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "RLima", "created_at": "September 20, 2016 at 6:34am", "created_by": "RLima", "topic": "Honeybee: unable to find error.log file", "replies": [{"body": "\nThere is a similar discussion[here](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/error-with-old-image-based-simulation-and-new-image-based?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1566689&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987).

The reason you get this error instead of a\u00a0meaningful error is because I don't log the errors for the init file which I should have. I will add that.\n\nBut the main error comes from the\u00a0illegal vertical size of the image in fish-eye viewport. Let me check the details and get back to you. Looks like you're doing everything right.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 16, 2016 at 9:13pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nWell, turns out you were doing something wrong. The cameraType starts at 0 and not 1. You need to update\u00a0the value list component in your script to 0, 1, and 2. It's currently 1, 2 and 3. In your file, you were setting up a parallel run which is quite picky for vertical views.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7AULtQmLSn0XAgu15PtlleGZIyyEfAHedUjm5IaTt0bblIaxjpIZV-n3TNCZDF7MwbFZdxgYqST5SRVKnNtZsOcIVSA1Hg4V/ValueList.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/7AULtQmLSn0XAgu15PtlleGZIyyEfAHedUjm5IaTt0bblIaxjpIZV-n3TNCZDF7MwbFZdxgYqST5SRVKnNtZsOcIVSA1Hg4V/ValueList.PNG)\n\nStill, we need to add a log to init component to give a more meaningful error message.\n\n\n\nFinally, you need to pick higher values for -ar and lower values for -aa for your analysis.
