As for the WindowShadeGenerator pay attention that you need to set to True the writeEPObjs_ input.\n\nSee blue arrows for more changes as for the newest HB version.\n\nI also marked with bix red X those elements that will be phased out or are not there anymore. We need to get used to those changes.\n\nI left a big question mark for Chris, asking for his advice as what i did is right for the Ideal Loads System. An updated example on Hydra will be helpful. I think i did ok but to be sure .. wait for his answer.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1590845", "name": "20160830_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 30, 2016 at 5:09am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThank you for the reply. Due to the large number of discussions if there is anything that Chris and I need to have a look it's more reliable to post them on github. I'm not sure if Chris has seen your comment. I wish ning had the feature to mention names similar to github, twitter, etc.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 11, 2016 at 9:40am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThe truth is that in my answer there was nothing to post on github. I was in doubt about how to define correctly an Ideal System, but i think i get it from the last Chris's webinar.\n\nIf Claudia is still in need of this discussion i can update the file, but seems to be that she isn't.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "September 11, 2016 at 10:25am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}]}]}
