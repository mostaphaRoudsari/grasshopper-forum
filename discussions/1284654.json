{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am a new to group and I have been learning ladybug for a couple of weeks,\n\nI tried a simple practice to find annual simulation for a room, but I faced two problems:\n\n1. I can't find the way to solve the error: \u00a0\"length of the results is not equal to the number of mesh faces\"\n\nas it seems other members had the same problem, but i couldn't find the answer to my file.\n\n2. on Honeybee read annual result, the illfilesaddress doesn't read the result from annual analysis file and the connection line is red.\n\nI attached the gh file and the rhino.\n\nThanks.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1284652", "name": "4.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1284653", "name": "4.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Fahimeh Motazedian", "created_at": "May 11, 2015 at 10:58am", "created_by": "FahimehMotazedian", "topic": "errors on annual daylight simulation", "replies": []}
