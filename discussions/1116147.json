There is a component at down left that does what you are looking for. I made it based on David Rutten's example. You can connect one or multiple sliders to the component and it will iterate between all possible combinations.\n\nIf you have TT-Toolbox plugin installed there is a Brute-Force component that also does this. Good luck with your studies and let me know if you have any other question.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 15, 2014 at 4:50pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,<br/><br/>I am dealing with a similar issue as Reinier. I am using the component that you are talking about, however when I run my simulations the results from the first option gets lost.

Of course I can just copy the results before I do this, but that can be quite inconvenient.\u00a0<br/><br/>Is there perhaps a simpler way of doing this.
