{"body": "\nHello everyone\n\n\n\nI am trying to generate grid-based daylight analysis and I have trouble setting my grid mesh on the floor. Please see the attached. I don't know why my analysis nodes are generated on a surface parallel to the wall rather than floor. And I don't know how to change the \"DIR\" to inside the box rather than outside.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks and I appreciate your help.\n\n\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1642221", "name": "Test2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 18, 2016 at 5:52pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "Setting The Grid for Daylight Analysis", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ladan,\n\nYou can use decompose brep component to get the faces and then using list item you can find the bottom plane. To change DIR you can use native grasshopper flip component. I have used the same in the attached file.\n\nSince your geometry was not internalized, I used a sample 5m x 5m x 3m box to run the simulation. The file is attached for your reference.\n\nDevang\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2DwxeRmxZZGDkbHWgWGzuffrtZt2YwzQWPHSbTYzTql*jQYxA0QgeDcBvK6rPK*KFhhnAYfSOmlfUJfLVNaVA5NWf8S3TIM0/ScreenClip.png\" width=\"709\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2DwxeRmxZZGDkbHWgWGzuffrtZt2YwzQWPHSbTYzTql*jQYxA0QgeDcBvK6rPK*KFhhnAYfSOmlfUJfLVNaVA5NWf8S3TIM0/ScreenClip.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1642416", "name": "Test2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "November 18, 2016 at 7:27pm", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you very much for your help!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 20, 2016 at 9:53am", "created_by": "LillyGD", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1642222"}
