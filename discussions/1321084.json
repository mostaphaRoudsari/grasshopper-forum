To clarify with the sill height, this input works on a surface-by-surface basis and is not absolute to the zone (that could easily create conditions where the input glazing ratio did not match the actual geometric glazing ratio produced).\n\nYou probably want to use the addHBGlz component for your case and make a custom window surface (perhaps doing so parametrically with native GH components if you still want to be able to change the glazing ratio). \u00a0I think this addHBGlz component will be particularly helpful if you sync with the Honeybee github since Mostapha just put in the capability to plug in an entire zone to this component a few days ago. \u00a0Now that you can plug in an whole zone and the component will automatically figure out which surface of the zone the window should be belong to. \u00a0Immensely useful for cases like yours.\n\n2.

Hot, warm, slightly warm, neutral, slightly cool, cool, cold. When they make their choice of expressions, I am predetermining the options and sending it to grasshopper/ladybug(like a schedule). I know I can do this option as each case but I am wondering whether I can program to run the simulation through all options or if you have any other way to go about it, could you let me know? I am not an expert at programming but I am learning.\u00a0\n\nThis is what I messaged Mostapha too and I have attached my research abstract to give you an overview of what I am doing.\u00a0\n\n<br/>Thank you Chris and Mostapha!\n\n<br/>Vinu\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1321614", "name": "lwlaAbstract.png"}], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "July 7, 2015 at 12:09am", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Vinu,\n\n1. Chris means to update your components to the latest version (which lives on github). You can use update components to update your components or you can download it manually from Github. Here is an example for the new version of the component ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/is-there-a-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/is-there-a-quick-way-to-add-a-window-to-a-surface-of-a-zone?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1316675&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)).\n\n\n\n2. Thank you for sharing the image and the abstract. It's an interesting approach. I'm not sure if I understand how the feedback loop works but here is my 2 cents based on my current understanding.\n\nIf the geometry is not changing in your case I think the best approach for you is to export the idf file once from Honeybee, and then run your cases from the command line in the server.\n\nIn this case you will have one main .idf file which looks for some .csv files as the schedule. Now you can re-write the csv file and run the simulation from the command line and parse the results back.\n\nBased on the number of your scenarios you may want to have a couple of idf files for different cases and run them all in parallel. That should give you a better performance.\n\nI hope I understand your problem right! Feel free to continue the conversation here if you have any other questions.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 8, 2015 at 2:45pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nHow to connect many idf files and run them all in parallel?\n\nVinu\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "September 14, 2015 at 6:25pm", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThere is no component in Honeybee to do this but you can develop your own.

That may change the architecture of your system. You may need to run much more simulations at the same time - I also think there might be solutions to pre-run the simulations.\n\nOne of the feedback that I was always thinking to give to an occupant is to tell them the effect of their decision also in $. For example if you can tell them by bringing the thermostat down for 2 degrees and tolerating a higher comfort range they will save X amount of money in the year that might make people thinking about it in a different way. Energy and comfort metrics are so abstract for the majority of the occupants!\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 8, 2015 at 2:49pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n1.
