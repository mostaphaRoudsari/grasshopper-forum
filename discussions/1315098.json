{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nMy energy Plus model keeps failing. I identified the problem and have a workaround, but wanted to share in case anyone else runs into something similar.\n\n\n\nI am making a large EPlus model from custom zones\u00a0created through individually defined HBSurfaces. I am piping about 50 zones with roughly 20 fa\u00e7ade panels each into a single idf file. My branching structure creates a lot of\u00a0similarly named surfaces.\u00a0Eplus fails because similarly named surfaces are automatically renamed \"SurfaceName_Dup_Dup_Dup.........\" until the names are so long that\u00a0Eplus truncates them. This seems to crash the program in a variety of different ways. I don't know exactly why this happens, but I solved the error by assigning a unique name to each HBsurface. I used the data tree path of the inputs to create random numbers and then appended this unique number to a common title.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt would be great if Honeybee could rename all duplicate HBsurfaces with a unique random number, like a serial number,\u00a0rather than appending _Dup to each new option. Is this possible or is that an Eplus thing?\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "June 24, 2015 at 5:04pm", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "topic": "EPlus error: Surface_Dup_Dup names getting truncated", "replies": [{"body": "\nDear Mr. Curtis\n\nMany thanks for sharing solutions,\u00a0\n\ncould you please have it a look to my post,\n\n[Struggled visualize the surface results](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/struggled-visualize-the-surface-results)\n\nI think my problem falls in this issue, and I hope you can share a simple file or illustration showing what how you did the \" the data tree path of the inputs to create random numbers and then appended this unique number to a common title.\"\n\ni'm quite new with the data tree,,,\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yasin Mohamed Ibrahim", "created_at": "June 25, 2015 at 2:44am", "created_by": "YasinMohamedIbrahim", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nI forgot to ask about how to name the Skylights in general and what to do if I have many,,, its generating pretty long names!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Sh7zTInlQptbirfHZpyZdPoPK-Ch-Fal76ebebPzWa4EN4X0zQcRYE88cz2*1Jo851TzjThLWi3oBpEvC*6oyS9nCfLrtANj/surfaces.png\" width=\"703\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Sh7zTInlQptbirfHZpyZdPoPK-Ch-Fal76ebebPzWa4EN4X0zQcRYE88cz2*1Jo851TzjThLWi3oBpEvC*6oyS9nCfLrtANj/surfaces.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yasin Mohamed Ibrahim", "created_at": "June 26, 2015 at 3:54am", "created_by": "YasinMohamedIbrahim", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Leland,\n\nIt is happening inside Honeybee and is possible to change.
