I think I may be stressing my machine to the limit and it just will not compute. I've let it run for multiple hours. Any insights would be wonderful.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n\nGjergji\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Gjergjji Shkurti", "created_at": "September 20, 2016 at 6:51pm", "created_by": "GjergjjiShkurti", "topic": "Trees in Outdoor Thermal Comfort", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Gjergji,\n\n\n\nIf you can provide your GH script it will be easier for people to take a look and help.\n\n\n\nI am guessing that you are assessing the impact of multiple trees following Chris's example. If the geometry representing the trees is simple enough (most of the time flat surfaces will do) it should not put much stress on the simulation. I am not sure what happens with more complex shapes and the view factor calculations. You can try starting with a very coarse grid and move to more refined studies perhaps.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "September 21, 2016 at 9:35pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Gjergji,<br/><br/>Sunpath shading component supports using single/multiple irregular tree geometries for outdoor comfort.<br/>You can [download an example in here](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/xn/detail/2985220:Comment:1570005).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "September 28, 2016 at 1:45am", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHey All Here is the file with model.\n\ndjordje the script you reference is the one I'm using.\n\n\n\n[](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topic/listForContributor?user=2h2kxq6q1lacq)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Gjergjji Shkurti", "created_at": "September 30, 2016 at 10:16am", "created_by": "GjergjjiShkurti", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Gjergjji,<br/><br/>[The link](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/xn/detail/2985220:Comment:1570005)\u00a0I provided in my previous reply is not the link to the starting reply of the topic.
