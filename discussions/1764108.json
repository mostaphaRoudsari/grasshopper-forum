{"body": "\nHi. I have used Ladybug tools for 1.5 years.It is an amazing software for environmental analysis in Grasshopper and Rhino platform. As I know,Honeybee can calculate the horizontal and vertical lighting illuminance.\n\n\n\nRecently I am involved in the office building project. The client asked our team to \u00a0calculate the cylindrical illuminance. So I came here and started this discussion.\n\n\n\nIs there any method or some component in Honeybee can be used for calculating the cylindrical illuminance ?\n\nI uploaded the relevant file to the attachment. Please look at it!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1764106", "name": "Cylindrical illuminance.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1764107", "name": "In-field measurement of cylindrical illuminance and the impact of room surface reflectances on the visual environment.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Minggang Yin", "created_at": "June 6, 2017 at 1:31am", "created_by": "minggangyin", "topic": "How to calculate the cylindrical illuminance in the room?", "replies": [{"body": "\nThis way of doing lighting calculations is far too esoteric for it be of any use as a\u00a0 permanent script in Honeybee.\n\nThere is a [paper](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1477153515593579) in lighting research and technology which discusses a Radiance-based workflow for an improvement over this method. All the ingredients required for performing that simulation are already present in Honeybee. By the way, if you'd like to undestand more about this I'd suggest the writings of Chris Cuttle. He has been discussing this concept for more than a decade.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "June 6, 2017 at 3:51am", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nI think you should set some vertical vectors for the test point in the grid, in eight different directions like what they did in the paper attached.
