One more limitation of Daysim is to model dynamic shadings for multiple windows. This is a very important limitation when it comes to calculating ASE accurately. The only accurate solution that I'm aware of for calculating ASE is Radiance's 3-Phase method. Also be careful about using annual DGP calculation with Daysim ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/243](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/243)). In case you're using annual glare analysis make sure to double check the results by point in time glare analysis.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 15, 2015 at 8:08am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nASE, as described in IES\u00a0 LM 83-12, is supposed to be calculated considering direct sun contribution only. Which roughly translates to an -ab 0 (ie 0 bounce) calculation in Radiance/Daysim. It is assumed that a 1000 lux measurement for a particular hour on a workplane grid point will indicate a illuminance from direct sun at that point. If I remember correctly, these simulations are to be run without the presence of any shading devices.\n\n\n\nFrom an ASE calculation perspective, there are several shortcomings within Daysim (as it exists right now). The daylight coefficient method, which Daysim employs, calculates illuminance by dividing the sky into discrete patches. ([http://naturalfrequency.com/wiki/sky-subdivision](http://naturalfrequency.com/wiki/sky-subdivision)) For a clear sky with sun, the luminance from sun is accounted for by approximating the position of sun into 3 (as far as I know) patches. That in turn leads to an incorrect estimation of both position and luminance contribution of the sun.\n\n\n\nAnyways, as I wrote in the begining, in my opinion the closest you'd get to calculating ASE from daysim right now would be running an annual daylighting calculation with Honeybee by setting ambient bounces as zero. A better approach, in case you are not trying to comply with something like leed v4, would be to do a DGP analysis as Chris mentioned in his post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "November 14, 2015 at 1:27am", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you \u00a0very much Sarith for your useful comment.

I also put the results in terms of \"hours of a typical 24-hour day\" since it seems many people have a hard time understanding \"hours of the year\" intuitively. \u00a0Finally, I use these sunlight hours to make a temporal map showing when the glare is likely to occur. \u00a0I have found a good correlation between the presence of direct beam sun shining on the floor in these studies (even in small amounts) and Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) values above 0.4 (perceptible glare) for views looking towards the window or towards the floor by the window.\n\n\n\nHere is an example file showing you how to do this calculation with the sunpath for yourself:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Estimate_Glare_Potential_Over_a_Year)\n\nAlso, Mahsa, there is usually no need to use excel when you have the data in GH. \u00a0GH provides you with native math components that essentially have all of the capabilities of Excel (see the example file above).\n\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 14, 2015 at 9:24pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nTo add to Chris's comment about inclusion of ASE in LEED v4 being confusing, that opinion is actually shared by a fair number of daylighting experts.\n\nChristoph Reinhart, whose research contributed to the creation of Daysim and DIVA, wrote an editorial about the daylighting metrics in LEED v4 where he raises similar concerns : [http://lrt.sagepub.com/content/47/4/388.full.pdf+html](http://lrt.sagepub.com/content/47/4/388.full.pdf+html)\n\nDr. Reinhart, incidentally, is Alstan's dissertation advisor.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "November 14, 2015 at 10:05pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nthank you Sarith for letting me know about Dr. Reinhart's technical note, it answers a lot of my questions regarding the validity of this metric.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mahsa Zomorodian", "created_at": "November 15, 2015 at 7:21pm", "created_by": "MahsaZomorodian", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nthank you Chris and Mostapha for your \u00a0detailed \u00a0explanations and clarifications for the metric and how to calculate it.
