{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\n\n\nI was trying to convert a bunch of Breps into HBSurfaces and ran into the following error:\n\n1. Solution exception:'NoneType' object is unsubscriptable\n\n\n\nI tried troubleshooting the file by testing Breps individually and found the errors occur in the case of Open Breps (especially those which seem to have lines in them).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Arj-j*1Gcz0jODL7COBCy5gXEERH5Cvdi9Al-yxeq4Itqvon3sJPXtWXPBlR*MmpomzyQ7h8tj6aNdzV1-QYhReSWkrXPopZ/219201695857PM.bmp?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Arj-j*1Gcz0jODL7COBCy5gXEERH5Cvdi9Al-yxeq4Itqvon3sJPXtWXPBlR*MmpomzyQ7h8tj6aNdzV1-QYhReSWkrXPopZ/219201695857PM.bmp)\n\nClosed Breps and Untrimmed surfaces seem to work fine.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Arj-j*1Gcz0gdLSvmy47w6ULYk7oNjNVEmLJktiTNxx4Ie3McM5OfvKYXl9UPV5ACy7WGhMa8cE9Wsj1yqr7-5KpkilqwfBP/219201695927PM.bmp?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Arj-j*1Gcz0gdLSvmy47w6ULYk7oNjNVEmLJktiTNxx4Ie3McM5OfvKYXl9UPV5ACy7WGhMa8cE9Wsj1yqr7-5KpkilqwfBP/219201695927PM.bmp)\n\nCan anyone point me to a solution/workaround for this ?
