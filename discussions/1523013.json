{"body": "\nHelp!!\n\n\n\nI am a new user to grasshopper and ladybug, I followed all the instructions online and downloaded both honeybee and ladybug in order to perform a sun study for my roof design.\u00a0\n\nHowever, my commands always pop up orange telling me that I need a newer version of ladybug, however my version should be already the most updated version. Also it was working initially and running the sunpaths, it is when I wanted to perform the ladybug sunlight hour analysis that it stopped working. I have attached my file below.\u00a0\n\n\n\nYour help would be greatly appreciated.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1523012", "name": "weather test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sisi Yu", "created_at": "May 4, 2016 at 12:45pm", "created_by": "SisiYu", "topic": "Error: saying needing updated ladybug", "replies": [{"body": "\nSisi,\n\nNot sure what you are trying to do with all those sunpaths, but they, in general, are ok.\n\nAs for the sunlight hours you were missing to provide some inputs and geometry (both geometry and context).
