{"body": "\nHello guys,\n\nSome components can collect annual hourly data and display it in additional analysis. I find it very useful but what slows me down is lack of control for the parameters for the data.\n\nFor example if I want to show temperature distribution on a wind rose with specific color scheme, low/high bounds and number of segments I have to crop wind speed diagram (left) out of the image because legend parameter that I set for the dry bulb temp (right) ruins parameters for the wind speed.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/QqEwKwheuH8kjcHlE0GpAMPXdX0heFwZjfj1j4lQzYoegsTtW3VoQMzTtIiVPwSZFOvTdfKhMLi6IbdWLjTSwFdGKdGMKJlP/Capture.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/QqEwKwheuH8kjcHlE0GpAMPXdX0heFwZjfj1j4lQzYoegsTtW3VoQMzTtIiVPwSZFOvTdfKhMLi6IbdWLjTSwFdGKdGMKJlP/Capture.PNG)\n\nThis is how it looks like (but not working):\n\nWind rose picks up legend par #1 only\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/QqEwKwheuH8ZAkzAc0WbGXJ95Exu5gn5U6Dr*h*EU5wIct*uJB2A36S4TWIEypY0yRia0wFBRvir6h6yAXi1EwOR2rZe5DNs/wish.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/QqEwKwheuH8ZAkzAc0WbGXJ95Exu5gn5U6Dr*h*EU5wIct*uJB2A36S4TWIEypY0yRia0wFBRvir6h6yAXi1EwOR2rZe5DNs/wish.PNG)\n\nIf I'm missing something \u00a0and there is a way to control multiple legends please let me know, I will delete this post.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 11:09pm", "created_by": "Timur582", "topic": "WISH: make multiple Legend Par connections", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Tim, You can pass a list to legend parameters if you have more than one graph.
