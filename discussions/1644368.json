{"body": "\nHello\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am wondering how I can create only one legend, rather than multiple, for daylighting simulation in case I have multiple zones? basically, HB creates one legend per space and I want it to eliminate those and create one big legend for my whole floor plan. Please see the attached files.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your help\u00a0\n\n\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1644366", "name": "SingleTime-Sep21_12pm.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1644367", "name": "CCC_Honeybee_Gridbased_22_11_16.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 22, 2016 at 12:46pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "One Legend for Multiple Zones in Daylighting Simulation", "replies": [{"body": "\njoin the mesh and flatten the results: [http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/remove-lege...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/remove-legend-bar-from-recolour-mesh?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1588287&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 22, 2016 at 12:49pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha, I created them like this (see the file attached) but it didn't work.

I attached an example file. It is the same I sent you earlier. I have prepared a common legend in the file for your reference.\n\nDevang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1644399", "name": "Test2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "November 22, 2016 at 9:27pm", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n1.
