{"body": "\nHello everyone,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have been trying to visualize the sunpath shading for a vertical PV surface. The PhotovolaticSurface component seems to be working properly and outputting a reasonable value for ACenergyPerYear... however, I can't get the shading visualization to show up under the SunpathShading component. The surface normal is correct. It works fine with a horizontal surface - has anyone else discovered this problem and been able to make it work?\u00a0\n\n\n\nI attached a couple screen shots of what the sunpathshading looks like with a vertical and horizontal PV surface.\n\n\n\nOutputs, AC Energy per year (I tested a very small surface which is why the value is so low)\n\nHorizontal: 0.022671 kWh\n\nVertical: 0.005322 kWh\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMaria\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1609956", "name": "Horizontal Sunpathshading.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1609957", "name": "Vertical Sunpathshading.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Maria Grimm", "created_at": "October 3, 2016 at 3:38pm", "created_by": "MariaGrimm", "topic": "Vertical PV: Viewing the Sunpath Shading", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Maria,<br/><br/>Can you please attach your .gh and .3dm files?<br/>Thank you.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "October 3, 2016 at 4:09pm", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": [{"body": "\nAbsolutely - thanks for your input!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1610087", "name": "161003 Ladyug Vertical PV.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1610088", "name": "161003 Ladybug Vertical PV.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Maria Grimm", "created_at": "October 3, 2016 at 6:01pm", "created_by": "MariaGrimm", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Maria,<br/><br/>This is a bug with tolerances. The component would work properly if one would angle the vertical surface just tiny little bit (0.1 degrees for example).\n\n<br/>Attached below is the fixed version of Sunpath shading component.\n\nThe \"unofficial\" label below it, is just a reminder that this component is still not publicly released through Ladybug github repository.<br/><br/>Thank you for reporting the bug!! This plugin and its components would definitively not be what it is without the support of the users like you!!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1610877", "name": "161003LadybugVerticalPV2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "October 4, 2016 at 3:42pm", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks so much for your help with this!
