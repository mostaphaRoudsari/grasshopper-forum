{"body": "\nHi. I've created a building manually, with levels and windows. I turned the geometry into honeybee zones, created the windows with Add glazing tool and now I'm trying to simulate it, but i get this error message:\u00a0Solution exception:'EPZone' object has no attribute 'cenPt' geometry. When I try to simulate a simple geometry, just for test, it runs. Can anyone help me?[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DLsMNj26FUXqND5xt7RfRHw6qTYxBCjWbXgYwPmy4L0gNEalj4ZA3hUpLl8ASfmYq6EQFsuXFC-Yn7w4hLjxu3*Wj9l*HjtH/Semttulo.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DLsMNj26FUXqND5xt7RfRHw6qTYxBCjWbXgYwPmy4L0gNEalj4ZA3hUpLl8ASfmYq6EQFsuXFC-Yn7w4hLjxu3*Wj9l*HjtH/Semttulo.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1571519", "name": "Modelo de desempenho - Andressa 02 teste.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Andressa L.
