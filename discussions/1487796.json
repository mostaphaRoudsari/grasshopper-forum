{"body": "\nHi, everyone, I'm quite new to HB and I was trying to get a thermal comfort map following Chris's code, But there are two main questions.\n\n\n\nA. The E+ simulation get a warning: there are non-convex srf. I have modeled all zones as cubes and not sure why it is still considered as non-convex. I have looked through several posts and it seems like this error will effect the surface temperature simulation which would be not accurate for thermal comfort. But I don't know how to find those surfaces and rebuild the model (some posts mentioned to split the non-convex zone, anyone can give an example about how to do that?)\n\n\n\nB.After hours not figuring out the previous problem, I was thinking about running the thermal map to see how serious the error would effect. And there's come another problem. \u00a0I set a summer day and Before sunset the result seems reasonable, however after 6 pm, the indoor temperature keeps over 38 C ( I used weather file of San Antonio). It seems like my cooling system doesn't work. And I have no clue how to check them out.\n\n\n\nThanks.\n\nQinheng\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1487793", "name": "ThermalcomfMap2.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1487794", "name": "ThermalcomfortMap.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1487795", "name": "nonConvexSrf.png"}], "created_by_name": "Qinheng", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 7:33pm", "created_by": "Qinheng", "topic": "Thermal Map question -- non-convex srf and schedule", "replies": [{"body": "\nAnd another attachment about the thermal result, after 6pm it's super hot.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1487800", "name": "heatingcoolingSystem.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Qinheng", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 7:33pm", "created_by": "Qinheng", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nA.

After split all these surfaces the simulation works fine. And for the second question, when I turned on the 'Ideal air load system' at create HB zone component, the result became reasonable, so I think I might have missed some settings when I turned it off and set my own HVAC system. Do you or anyone else would be so kind to share an example file or advises about how to set up one's own HVAC system (or is that feasible)? Or should I just use the ideal air system and use the set HBzone load and schedule components to customize it?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n-Qinheng\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Qinheng", "created_at": "March 19, 2016 at 4:18pm", "created_by": "Qinheng", "replies": []}]}]}
