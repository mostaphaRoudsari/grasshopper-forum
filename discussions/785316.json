If you upgraded to Rhino 5 the paths might be still pointing to a directory where Rhino 5 used to be installed.\n\nUse the file attached to check the path on your system.

Updating the libraries should solve the problem.\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\n[<img src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/eaLdH5zGUVB1mQsWCrpEsDOKrWEDmeLwzlanuWqNrvJIn6n4FNT98YcXGHfIQ83bOQNpDfa7jNJ3wrBU*iWrhjzFiKZj6-8h/pathInPython.jpg?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/eaLdH5zGUVB1mQsWCrpEsDOKrWEDmeLwzlanuWqNrvJIn6n4FNT98YcXGHfIQ83bOQNpDfa7jNJ3wrBU*iWrhjzFiKZj6-8h/pathInPython.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A785094", "name": "pathInPython.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 7, 2013 at 11:24am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you! \u00a0Evidently, I didn't have the C:\\Program Files\\... path. \u00a0It's up and running now and looks fantastic.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Burin", "created_at": "February 7, 2013 at 11:32am", "created_by": "Burin", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nNice!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 7, 2013 at 11:33am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I have the same problem.
