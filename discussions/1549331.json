{"body": "\n\n\nHowdy all,\n\n\n\nI noticed that if I scale down a Honeybee surface , and then use that scaled surface as a child surface (window) for the Honeybee surface this process doesn't work for concave surfaces but works well for convex surfaces such as rectangles.\n\n\n\nIs there a specific reason why this is the case? I had to split my concave surface (see picture 1) into several convex surfaces for this process to work (see picture 2 - blue is windows), do you think it would be a good idea to automate this process?\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1549329", "name": "Concave.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1549330", "name": "convex.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "June 16, 2016 at 5:23pm", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "topic": "addHBGlz for concave surfaces", "replies": []}
