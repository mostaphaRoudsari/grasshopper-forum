{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI have a suggestion, if it is possible to make, for a new output (or a modification of the existing one) for the\u00a0Sunlight Hours Analysis component. Often is important to calculate on a facade the direct sunlight hours per node per day. With the actual component it is not possible (I think). You can calculate only totals (per node=sunlightHoursResult output and all the nodes=totalSunlightHours output). What is interesting the existing output\u00a0sunIsVisible but the thing is that it considers the hours of sun from the sunrise to the sunset so when you try to split the list using the 24h it doesn't work (fig 1). So if you don't know for every day of the analysis period the duration of the day you cannot split the list coming from the output sunIsVisible (Fig 1). To overpass this I had to calculate the actual hours of the day for every day of the analysis period from the sunPositionInfo of the SunPath component (Fig 2) but it is very tricky. So what I suggest is to add a second sunIsVisible outup but on the 24 hours. Thank you!!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/odYCBfvo76ZGFaz8aruSM*pRZImnAYqNeFhE60yRhqIsVcSi266Nouq7Hl57UnbvKyMPtB41ChCHR4C7QZoO7lmikWsEbIbA/24h.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/odYCBfvo76ZGFaz8aruSM*pRZImnAYqNeFhE60yRhqIsVcSi266Nouq7Hl57UnbvKyMPtB41ChCHR4C7QZoO7lmikWsEbIbA/24h.JPG)\n\nFig 1\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/odYCBfvo76a*vn6kvRCmcJyKZF53tFEUZtn5UuWSOvULAhj8KZpOjk44NlZBCMB83bNocAqB8Xbb*odORzKdunhTa0LrcE-x/varh.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/odYCBfvo76a*vn6kvRCmcJyKZF53tFEUZtn5UuWSOvULAhj8KZpOjk44NlZBCMB83bNocAqB8Xbb*odORzKdunhTa0LrcE-x/varh.JPG)\n\nFig 2\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "November 19, 2015 at 6:43am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "Sunlight Hours Analysis output", "replies": [{"body": "\nFrancesco,\n\nThe separation of the \"hour of the year\" data from the sunlight hours component is critical to its flexibility and power to take any vector you want as input.\u00a0 So I would be opposed to making such hourly information a required input for the component just to get the data out of the sunlight hours component in a daily format.\n\nHowever, this type of situation is definitely something that the \"Ladybug_Branch Data\" component should be taking care of for you.\u00a0 Accordingly, I have modified the dataEachDay output of this component to be a \"dataEachDayOfYear\" so that you only need one component to get the results you need instead of 9:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ls0m4bJ0x4eySXEBqR6nFAiYZEnXuTDZfWum2FN4Aw3oLQvgLdxgt1qF*Es5*sYIqPwWSPCAAAxlUCGsIcEw-l8G0D1TgI1r/DayMonthHour.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ls0m4bJ0x4eySXEBqR6nFAiYZEnXuTDZfWum2FN4Aw3oLQvgLdxgt1qF*Es5*sYIqPwWSPCAAAxlUCGsIcEw-l8G0D1TgI1r/DayMonthHour.JPG)\n\nYou can find this more elegant way of getting daily values in the attached file and on the LB Github.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1405377", "name": "ImprovedDayMonthHour.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 10:04am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHello Chris,\n\nindeed I tried also to use the DMH component but I didn't manage to get what I needed.
