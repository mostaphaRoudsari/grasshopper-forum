{"body": "\nHi\u00a0\n\nI have installed the latest version of BF v3 and OpenFoam v1612.. but when I run BlockMesh component in Grasshopper, I get a severe error regarding Openfoam ...\n\n\n\n1. Solution exception:Failed to find container id.Do you have the OpenFOAM container running?<br/>You can initiate OpenFOAM container by running start_OF.bat:<br/>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ESI\\OpenFOAM\\1612\\\\Windows\\Scripts\\start_OF.bat\n\n\n\nI have read other Issue problems such as\u00a0[#1](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/butterfly-test-simulation-for-case-with-fvscheme-updated-is-not)\u00a0,\u00a0[#2](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/butterfly-block-mesh-error)\u00a0,\u00a0[#3](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/butterfly-doesn-t-work-with-opefoam-v1606)\u00a0or OpenFoam Installation instructions but till now I couldn't run the simulation .. I figured out there is sth wrong with my openfoam installation where there should be a container called of-plusv1612-centos66 that openfoam must read it but it can not find it .. I checked with docker quickstart terminal as showed in pictures .. It could read the image but can not find the of-plusv1612 container ..\u00a0\n\n\n\nDo you have any suggestions?\n\n\u00a0\n\nP.S. I have opened all the possible files with or without administrator permissions but wasn't solved ..\n\nThanks \u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1694933", "name": "of-start container power shell.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1694934", "name": "docker.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1694935", "name": "start-of.bat.png"}], "created_by_name": "AMIR TABADKANI", "created_at": "February 19, 2017 at 5:49am", "created_by": "AMIRTABADKANI", "topic": "OpenFoam Error in Butterfly (BlockMesh)", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Amir,\n\n\n\nI think running the container manually should solve it.

Including all the items and not only OF. Pay attention also to delete the .docker and .VirtualBox directories at your local C:\\Users\\USERNAME (see the point before the name).\n\nYou need to enable Hardware assisted virtualization at your machine BIOS (personally i don't like to play with the BIOS but OF asked for it).\n\nAfter that, do install a clean OF version, and go according to the other recommendations in this [link](http://www.openfoam.com/download/txt/openfoam-windows-readme_v1612+.txt).\n\n\n\nIt is working for me now on 2 machines (laptop and desktop).\n\nAfter that remember to run rhino as administrator.\n\nGood luck,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 22, 2017 at 9:25am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nSeems that Mikki found the answer to this one.
