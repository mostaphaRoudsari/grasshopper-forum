As for your 1st question I guess the outdoor air is doing a little bit of pre-cooling this is why\u00a0**Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Total Cooling Energy\u00a0**and\u00a0**Zone Ideal Loads Zone Total Cooling Energy\u00a0**are not equal.\n\n\n\n2.

You can report\u00a0**Zone Ideal Loads Outdoor Air Total Cooling Energy\u00a0**as it is in the ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem Outputs you just need to add it to the IDF file and then run the simulation.\n\n4. Do you have humidity control in your model? I would think that energy is being used to keep the supply air at a certain humidity.\n\nCheers,\n\nAnton\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "October 9, 2015 at 9:34am", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you, Anton!\n\n\n\n4.
