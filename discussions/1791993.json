{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\n\n\nFirst I'd like to thank Mostapha, Chris, Mingbo and everyone who made LB+HB in general, and the last release in particular, available to us all.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have a specific question related to HDR images, output from Radiance (or not necessarily in my case, but processed using Radiance/pcomb).\n\n\n\nHas anyone tried to apply bespoke or unusual gradient palettes to their false-colour images ?\n\nIt would be so great to be able to process images like grids, using a preset library much like this:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/resources/g...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/resources/gradients.jpg)\n\n\n\nI used to use the 5 available palettes described in A. Jacob's Radiance Cookbook (+ bespoke ones) on the command line with the old falsecolor.pl , but I don't think these are available now with falsecolor2.exe... am I right?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ez1i6iyJXXM2L17h4BYiwawNh8Z1q37dkJjoZdCdBM1MUih6hVmKz9IDDZVr0ywqaczvRudrpAfKfC189gzIxaYuL21NycZ9/fc_pal.JPG\" width=\"448\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ez1i6iyJXXM2L17h4BYiwawNh8Z1q37dkJjoZdCdBM1MUih6hVmKz9IDDZVr0ywqaczvRudrpAfKfC189gzIxaYuL21NycZ9/fc_pal.JPG)\n\nI am aware of the alternative old palette -spec but in the current HB false-colour component, but is that it ?\n\n\n\nAnother question for Mingbo - I get the following error message when trying to open the attached HDR file with your amazing new viewer:\u00a01. Solution exception:Parameter is not valid.\n\nAm I doing anything wrong ? I can see many useful applications to your pixel-value reader, especially if externally rendered HDR images can be loaded (which is the case here). Do they need a specific header to be \"valid\" ?\n\n\n\nMany thanks in advance for your help.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nJocelyn\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1791992", "name": "test.hdr"}], "created_by_name": "Jocelyn Urvoy", "created_at": "August 1, 2017 at 10:07am", "created_by": "JocelynUrvoy", "topic": "Processing HDR images / falsecolor2 palettes & the new image viewer", "replies": [{"body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Jocelyn,\n\n\n\nI can only answer your HDR error question:\n\nI just tested your hdr file, it works fine on my side. \u00a0I am not sure what caused that error.\n\nI will test this file on my another computer tomorrow, and will let you know if I find the same error.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DXrtOheepEEQ5alUzxYBGWNkVUzKsF*p0gbJuVXZrI0mY0gKLRJkHZuId99ZqJtL7yVRnKELPsdyMPXgdgXmNSVnrr9C7TLT/Capture.PNG\" width=\"533\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DXrtOheepEEQ5alUzxYBGWNkVUzKsF*p0gbJuVXZrI0mY0gKLRJkHZuId99ZqJtL7yVRnKELPsdyMPXgdgXmNSVnrr9C7TLT/Capture.PNG)\n\n\n\n-Mingbo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mingbo Peng", "created_at": "August 2, 2017 at 6:54pm", "created_by": "MingboPeng", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mingbo,\n\nThanks for your reply.\n\nThat's odd, I have tested on another computer too and get the same error.\u00a0\n\nCould it have to do with local save/admin rights etc?\u00a0\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nJocelyn\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jocelyn Urvoy", "created_at": "August 3, 2017 at 5:13am", "created_by": "JocelynUrvoy", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi,\n\nJust to comment that i can see the image too.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 3, 2017 at 9:42am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Jocelyn,\n\n\n\nYou are right, it is because of your account issue, but I have fixed this problem.\n\nI will do more tests, and will let you know if that is ready.\n\nThanks,\n\nMingbo\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mingbo Peng", "created_at": "August 3, 2017 at 3:18pm", "created_by": "MingboPeng", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1791993"}
