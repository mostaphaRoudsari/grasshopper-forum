{"body": "\nHi\n\n\n\nI have lots of experience at simulation, not so much with Rhino/Grasshopper. I have a process that generates energy performance for 10 zones in a multi-storey building: on the floor above the ground floor and the floor below the top floor.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen I link the output to the reporting\u00a0/ graphing tools I have the mismatch illustrated below. 10 zones x 8760 data points into the dry bulb and radiant temperature inputs (dotted links in picture) AND only 8760 data points for the Outdoor temperature and wind speed. As can be seen this creates a mismatch in types of lists that I am flummoxed by.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI get that the former two links are lists of list; and the latter two are lists as a labelling exercise, but yet understanding how to handle the processing of these lists so they are compatible is beyond me.\n\n\n\nAny help would be gratefully\u00a0received.\u00a0[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/07ksbO*mwU-YhP*JdoDi*4WcwMvLYqLgoMAwMZ2YzOMlRuIYsxLgFgcSy9s2QFTx2UO8aZUGNgV5szF6YVencJ09Fh1PXVFu/adaptive_Comfort_inputs.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/07ksbO*mwU-YhP*JdoDi*4WcwMvLYqLgoMAwMZ2YzOMlRuIYsxLgFgcSy9s2QFTx2UO8aZUGNgV5szF6YVencJ09Fh1PXVFu/adaptive_Comfort_inputs.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1773335", "name": "adaptive_Comfort_inputs.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Michael Donn", "created_at": "June 23, 2017 at 5:04am", "created_by": "MichaelDonn", "topic": "Adaptive Comfort Tool - reconciling input from multiple zones", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Michael,\n\n\n\nYou need to update the component by doing the following.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/07ksbO*mwU8KuPgGlJQ3O7ejGHRycW-1PetBlSS6LyOLEZyZ7Mx*bp2vQpxoIF9IH6XtqZRkt2ivahc-lLXCEFLy-TK7J1gC/Update.png\" width=\"628\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/07ksbO*mwU8KuPgGlJQ3O7ejGHRycW-1PetBlSS6LyOLEZyZ7Mx*bp2vQpxoIF9IH6XtqZRkt2ivahc-lLXCEFLy-TK7J1gC/Update.png)\n\nI tried using the component with two zones and it works at my end.
