{"body": "\nHi everyone,\u00a0\n\nI was trying to install honeybee/ladybug in my new computer but I could not find version 8.1. Did they remove it from the website? I tried 8.2 but it does not work.

My only concern is that because of issues with loading OpenStudio libraries we will still need 8.1. Chien Si is making great progress on his side.\n\n\n\nTheodoros- Thank you for the offer. I'm not sure if we can distribute version 8-1 based on the license. I might be wrong though. If you have checked the license and it's fine then that sounds like a good idea.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 8:48am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nThat sounds good. \u00a0Another release would also be a huge help in with regard to the temperature maps. \u00a0I have noticed a fairly large interest in them from the community and not everyone is using the same workflow because of development since the last release. \u00a0Let me know when we have a date and I will be sure to have a final, stable temperature map workflow by then.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 2:46pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you guys for your replies,\u00a0\n\nI changed the name of the folder containing Energy Plus from 8.2 to 8.1 and now it works.\u00a0\n\nAle\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "February 24, 2015 at 2:50am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\n\n\nIf you follow the link below, you should be able to view a more comprehensive list of EnergyPlus releases: 8.1.1 through 8.2.1.\u00a0\n\n[EnergyPlus Downloads](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/tags)\u00a0([https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/tags](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/tags))\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Demian Vonder Kuhlen", "created_at": "February 23, 2015 at 2:35pm", "created_by": "DemianVonderKuhlen", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks for the tip, Demian. \u00a0That's a huge relief to know that it's still on the E+ Github page.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 23, 2015 at 8:07pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1228418"}
