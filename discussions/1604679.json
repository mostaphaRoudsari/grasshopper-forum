{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI am trying to run a solar radiation analysis. I downloaded the script from github and also rewrote the script several times. The result does not offer a range it just turns blue. I have tried changing the test geometry as well as the weather file and the result remains the same. I have attached a copy of the grasshopper script as well as an image of what I am getting. Any guidance I would be greatly appreciated!\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1604678", "name": "Capture.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "September 23, 2016 at 9:26am", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "topic": "Radiation Analysis", "replies": [{"body": "\n<br/>Whoops forgot to attach the grasshopper file\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1604593", "name": "Radiation_Analysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "September 23, 2016 at 9:26am", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 23, 2016 at 9:31pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you for your quick reply.\u00a0\n\nI tried setting useOldResult to false but I continue to get the same result.
