{"body": "\nHi all, i'm tryng to calculate PET value with Ladybug about outdoor thermal comfort study.\u00a0\n\nI am using for my thesis from which revenue Envimet some benchmarks including MRT and then through Rayman get the PET PMV SET index values. Unfortunately I can not (sorry I'm still in the early experiences with LB + HB) to calculate the PET with LB (maybe checking the result with that obtained by Rayman), my goal (idea) would be to write a component (or cluster) that allows me to determine the PET through the input of values as (potential temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, MRT)and\u00a0view all within my 3D model.\n\nThank you in advance.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Luciano", "created_at": "January 21, 2015 at 10:23am", "created_by": "Ambrosinus", "topic": "Is it possible to calculate PET value to evaluate Outdoor thermal comfort condition?", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Luciano,\n\nThank you for posting.\n\nUnfortunately Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) is the one comfort metric that Ladybug does not currently calculate. \u00a0For outdoor comfort, I usually suggest that people use universal thermal climate index (UTCI) and the \"Outdoor Comfort Calculator\" component will calculate this for you.\n\nStill, I know that both UTCI and PET form the current gold standard for outdoor comfort, depending on whether you have information on clothing and metabolic rate (when you would use PET) or prefer to have these variables adapted with the change in outdoor conditions (when you would use UTCI).\n\nTo be honest, the reason why I have been slower to integrate PET is because it seems very similar in principle to Outdoor Standard Effective Temperature (OUT_SET) and you can already calculate OUT_SET with the PMV comfort calculator. \u00a0I will also admit that I had more trouble finding documentation on how to calculate PET and its merits over OUT_SET. \u00a0Needless to say, if anyone on the forum knows of a good reference that explains how to calculate PET, I would be happy to take a look at it and pull together a means of calculating PET in Ladybug.\n\nI also know that the Ladybug developer Djordje Spasic has a lot of interest in the issue and there's a good chance that he is ahead of me on this. In case this is relevant to your study, his \"Thermal Comfort Indices\" component will calculate a number of different metrics - from wind chill to humidity index.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 22, 2015 at 3:02pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nLuciano,\n\nI will also say that, from my research, there is a general consensus that the metric of PMV is not suitable for outdoor comfort analyses. \u00a0At the least, if you use it for outdoor conditions, you cannot use it in the same way that you would for indoor conditions. \u00a0For example, you cannot say that, if PMV is in the range from +/- 1 PMV, at least 80% of people are comfortable. \u00a0It is known that people tolerate much more extreme conditions when they are outdoors and you will frequently find conditions where someone has a PMV of 1.6 or higher but will say that they are\u00a0perfectly\u00a0comfortable. \u00a0Also, the range of adaptability\u00a0with clothing and metabolic rate is much greater in the outdoors than in the indoors and these variables can be hard to guess for outdoor conditions unless you are an expert. \u00a0All that I am saying is to be cautious and critical if you use the PMV method for outdoor conditions.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 22, 2015 at 3:23pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris, Thank you so much for your help and explanation about PMV and outdoor comfort analyses!
