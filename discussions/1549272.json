{"body": "\nHi,\n\nThere is a DSF zone. On one side it has external windows which are supposed to be operable.\n\nIn front of them, there are other windows (between interior zone and the DSF zone) which are supposed\u00a0to be fixed.\n\nThe description of the Set EP Air Flow\u00a0component says that it works on ALL windows of the zone (mode 1: Window Natural Ventilation). Does it mean that the interior windows would also open and close together with the exterior ones? If yes, how can I make only the outer windows operable?\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nA.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aryan Shahabian", "created_at": "June 16, 2016 at 8:41pm", "created_by": "AryanShahabian", "topic": "How to Set EP Air Flow to operate only on outer windows in a Double Skin Facade", "replies": [], "id": "1549272"}
