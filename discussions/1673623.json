{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI recently found out that Ladybug had implemented the PV:surface / Sandia model in Ladybug, which is great.\n\n\n\nNow some questions:\n\n-Can you add surfaces that will cast shading on the PV surfaces? I can't find that.\n\n-Also, the outputs seems strange. When I look at the annual irradiation level, it is, let's say, 1000 kWh/m2 which seems fine according to the climate file (Copenhagen). Then, when I look at the power generated by the system, it is around 1/20th of what I would expect. Also the system size as showed in the result is around 1/20th of what it should be. Anyone has had problems with this?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1673622", "name": "test_PV.gh"}], "created_by_name": "jkanters", "created_at": "January 17, 2017 at 12:40am", "created_by": "JouriKanters", "topic": "PV:surface", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi jkanters,\n\n\n\nThe \"PVsurfacePercent_\" input ranges from 0 to 100. It has been set to 1.00 % which causes your annual values to be too low.\n\nAlso my advice is to not set the \"DCtoACderateFactor_\" input to 1.00. This is way too optimistic value, and in reality there will be a noticable difference between DC and final AC power output. You can use the 'DC to AC derate factor' component to account for/see some of these differences.\n\nI edited your definition and added an effect of shading.<br/>I used only a single PVsurface (horizontal rooftoop) to cut down the calculation time.<br/>But you can use as many of them as you like (the way you already did in your definition).\n\nI labeled in red (group) the 3 boolean toggles which you need to set to True, in order for definition to be ran.\n\n\n\nIt is also useful to check some of the example files from the Ladybug Photovoltaics [release topic](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/ladybug-photovoltaics-components-released).\n\n<br/>If you have any other/further issue or question, please do not hesitate to ask. We are here to help.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1673409", "name": "test_PV2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "January 17, 2017 at 4:49am", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": []}], "id": "1673623"}
