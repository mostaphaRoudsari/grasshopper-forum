{"body": "\nHallo everyone,\n\n\n\nI am quite new to this forum!\n\nI followed ALL Chris' video tutorials about thermal simulations with honeybee (thanks a lot by the way!).\n\nI am experiencing this problem: the attached grasshopper file seem to work but the results are not sensible at all to changes in loads and materials (i tried to put a 1m-thick concrete wall or 50 people instead of 2 and nothing changes inside!). On the contrary if I change the maximum indoor or outdoor temperature for natural ventilation, it ends up changing a lot.\n\n\n\nCan anyone take a look and help me? :)\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nIrene\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1558484", "name": "Simulazione Citt\u00e0 della Pace_OK.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Irene Giglio", "created_at": "July 1, 2016 at 3:46am", "created_by": "IreneGiglio", "topic": "Problem with materials and loads in Thermal Simulations", "replies": [{"body": "\nBy \"nothing changes\", you mean what result outputs, exactly?\n\nI see you are using a nat vent component, have you incrementally tested your definition to make sure it first works without nat vent, then add it, compare, rinse, repeat?\n\nBest,\n\nMax\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Max D", "created_at": "July 1, 2016 at 10:19am", "created_by": "ButWhyprecisely", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Max!\n\n\n\nYes, I mean the Operative Temperature inside the shoebox.\n\nI have tried with and without it and I don't understand what is wrong.
