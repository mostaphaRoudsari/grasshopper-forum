I think it would be interesting if we could also produce at the end a bill of materials including costs and factors like Embodied Energy and Carbon, Shadow costs and reports on Environmental Product Declaration formats.

EnergyPlus generates a number of outputs related to this topic but I never understood how they really do it not knowing about the source of materials and processes.

Is incredibly helpful. I will start a new discussion and will upload a short move of my plug-in for Grasshopper. Unfortunately is not of use to upload all of the work since is connected with some local databases that apparently will not work properly in every machine (or at least I didn't figure out how to do it).\n\n\n\nAs a short intro:\n\n\n\nWhat I used there is a data set including life cycle data for light -medium and heavy structural steel. The life cycle data are divided according to Environmental Product Declaration scheme (NEN 15804:2012) and reflect the energy used during the different life cycle stages of the product including the potential benefits for recycling/reuse. This kind of data exist for all different kind of material and the advantage of the EPDs is that you can accumulate data from different material/components for each phase and produce a final EPD for your structure (for example for reinforced steel you have EPD for cement and EPD for reinforced steel so you need the volumed of these 2 materials and then you add the EPD results and you have the final EPD for reinforced concrete e.t.c).\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis is one way to go which is formal and widely used. Part from that as a simpler solution a component calculating Embodied energy and Carbon for each material used in the model would also be great! (I will provide the component for this in the new discussion)\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn any case, I would be happy to help build something in this direction for Honeybee + Ladybug!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 9, 2015 at 4:02am", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThat discussion is extremely interesting.\n\nWould be interesting to see if we can have a comprehensive GH algorithm that takes into consideration source of materials, processes in combination with the EPD, Embodied Energy and Carbon.\n\nLooking forward for those components!\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "February 9, 2015 at 8:24am", "created_by": "doompop", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nIndeed it is interesting.

I would love to help in this project. The program daniel reports uses the Otobak database, which is a german free database of building materials. In essence, it is an xml collection of EPD data.\n\n\n\nIt might be a bit outdated. As a personal project I started collecting EPDs of building materials in order for me to be able to quickly assess the environmental impacts of my desings. EPDs report 6 (if I'm not mistaken) LCA environmental indices along with energy metrics.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy goal is to extract this information into perhaps a database that could be used for fast calculations. However, since I can't code to save my life I was planning to extract those info from the EPD files (pdfs) by..ehm..copy pasting..heh.\n\n\n\nI can share my data and assist in any way I can with you in this.\n\n\n\nHowever, as a final note, simply adding up EPD results gives a prediction of these metrics which will not be extremely accurate. Further issues need to be considered, like transportation to your location (EPW file can be used for this?), mode of transportation. Also, not all products have EPDs so using a cement EPD is an approximation, although vastly better than using nothing.\n\n\n\nAnyways, excited for this!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 13, 2015 at 8:28pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1217832"}
