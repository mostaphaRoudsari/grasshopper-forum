{"body": "\nHi everyone!\n\nFirst off I'd like to thank Mostapha, Chris and all the developers of this awesome software.\n\n\n\nI made a model to perform an optimization for the detailed design phase. The model is a university building with 81 thermal zones. I wanted to use this model on my master thesis, but I am afraid I won't be able. So I would really appreciate some help.\n\nThe purpose was to set different insulation thicknesses and glazing types depending on the orientation. Therefore I created every zone by using \"createHBsrfs\" components. At the same time different zones would have different \"building programs\".\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/nkQiLxDRFQV5M3xFB0juutdy37IngJn8DPhVfEoz-L8kmG5BbJnPZ6sgNSRsnZggbu*CSj6PA4NMw-ahIk*uT8HzIWbEvGsv/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nkQiLxDRFQV5M3xFB0juutdy37IngJn8DPhVfEoz-L8kmG5BbJnPZ6sgNSRsnZggbu*CSj6PA4NMw-ahIk*uT8HzIWbEvGsv/Capture.JPG)\n\n\n\nI created all the zones, I added windows as \"child surfaces\" for every zone. And I created the adjacencies. No errors or whatsoever.\n\nBut from this point I cannot connect the model to any other component without GH being frozen. So although the model is correct maybe it is to heavy for the software, however I am not sure if that is the reason.\u00a0\n\nIs it stupid what I have done? Is there any easier way to accomplish my purpose?\u00a0\n\nAny thought or help will be much appreciated.\n\nI attach the GH file.\n\nThank you,\n\nEduard\n\nVersion: HB 0.0.59 / LB 0.0.62\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1539422", "name": "University model.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Eduard Nunez", "created_at": "May 30, 2016 at 4:22pm", "created_by": "EduardNunez", "topic": "Model too large/complex to be used in HB?", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Eduard,\n\nI won't be able to check your model today but will try to check it before the end of the week. Did you try to check Task Manager? Is it an issue with memory? How much RAM do you have?
