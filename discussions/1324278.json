{"body": "\nThanks for the amazing work of Mostapha. But I find a question. Every time i run the daylight simulation, the results are different. For example, in the attached file, the average DF is 3.18% , but the value may be 3.17% next time. The question troubles me. Do you seen the problem? And who can tell me the reason. Thanks.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1324277", "name": "dfAnalysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "lintao", "created_at": "July 12, 2015 at 10:54am", "created_by": "lintao", "topic": "Question: why every time the simulation results is not the same?", "replies": [{"body": "\nDaylight simulation is stochastic. For every data point, Radiance throws out n rays in random directions, and running the same simulation multiple times means that different rays are fired. So a small deviation is normal.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James Ramsden", "created_at": "July 12, 2015 at 10:58am", "created_by": "JamesRamsden", "replies": [{"body": "\nthanks James\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "lintao", "created_at": "July 12, 2015 at 6:56pm", "created_by": "lintao", "replies": []}]}]}
