{"body": "\nOk I manage to\u00a0produce DLA analysis.

The definition always talks about 50% of the occupancy period. In HB the component only returns the DLA as a % of the Occ. Period.\n\nIs the 50% of Occ.Period required or DLA can also work as given by the HB component?\n\n\u00a0\n\nthank you all\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "June 18, 2014 at 11:59am", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "Daylight Autonomy", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "June 18, 2014 at 4:30pm", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you Claudio.
