{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI ve been using the VSC component extensively from some studies, and I would like to ask the following:\n\n\n\nI get the \"Non Plannar Vertex for Polygon\" alert during the analysis for some of the geometry I reference.\n\n\n\nDoes that mean that those parts of the geometry are not considered as context blocking the sky in the analysis? Or is it just a performance alert.\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nDimitris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "July 14, 2014 at 12:37pm", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Vertical Sky Component  Non Plannar Vertex for Polygon", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Dimitrios,\n\n\n\nIt is because Grasshopper mesh generates nonplanar surfaces. They will be considered in simulation. If you get so many of them then you probably want to generate the mesh yourself before using it for the analysis. If it is only for one or two then you can ignore it.\n\n\n\nI've recently modified the component to accept Grasshopper mesh setting so you can have a better control on meshing the geometry.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 14, 2014 at 5:51pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}], "id": "1102124"}
