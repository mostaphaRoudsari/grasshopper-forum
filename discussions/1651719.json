{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nIn my model, I generate context surfaces in two places. One to generate shading devices, the other to create surfaces for PV panel installation.\u00a0\n\nWhen running the EP simulation, I get the error **duplicate name** for the context surfaces. Is there any way to solve this, for example, can I create a list of unique names to assign to the list of surfaces?\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Willem Vandervoort", "created_at": "December 4, 2016 at 5:52am", "created_by": "WillemVandervoort", "topic": "Duplicate name of context surfaces", "replies": [{"body": "\nWillem,\n\nIt's hard to know what is going on without your GH file. \u00a0Please upload it if you can. \u00a0It seems that you probably don't need one of the copies of the context surfaces that you are plugging in.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 4, 2016 at 11:53am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nIn attachment you'll find my GH file.
