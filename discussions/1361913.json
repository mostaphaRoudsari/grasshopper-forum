{"body": "\nHi All!\n\n\n\nI am currently creating a file which will allow for a parametric simulation of a 2 storey building. I will be adding the myslider component to the parametric sliders once I have the file working. As is, I have a file which works to run a daylight simulation, create a lighting schedule and then use this to run an energy plus simulation (ParametricTest_Single).\n\n\n\nThe file is using custom made schedules and constructions for the NZ context (userCustomLibrary.idf)\n\n\n\nMy issue now is that I want to split the zones according to orientation (interior and perimeter), run daylight simulation for the grids within the individual zones, create a lighting schedule based on the DA result for each zone and then combine the zones again to run an energy simulation. However, I believe my workflow must be incorrect to do this, as I cannot get it to work. It simply comes up with a \"Solution exception: index out of range: 0\". This is in the Splitzones_issue file.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions? Much appreciated for any help!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1361910", "name": "SplitZones_Issue.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1361911", "name": "ParametricTest_Single.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1361912", "name": "userCustomEPLibrary.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "September 14, 2015 at 5:29pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Coupling Daylight and Energy Simulations - issues in splitting zones to create individual lighting schedules", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Elzine,\n\n\n\nSorry that no one has got back to you about solving your issue. I am trying to work out whats going wrong with your file now. Which components are giving you this error? Is it the Run Energy Plus simulation and the Honeybee Read EP result component? That is what I am getting.\n\n\n\nI am however having trouble with your building constructions. Simply some of them don't exist when I open your file on my machine. Since your work flow is so complicated and I'm having trouble with it can I suggest that you show me how your work flow is meant to work over Skype?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis would make it easier for me to work out whats going wrong.

This idf was created by Mostapha to enable us to easily use constructions from our old idf files without having to try and construct them all manually in honeybee.
