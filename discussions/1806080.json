There are differences on how Honeybee[+] loads the results based on the recipe.\n\n\n\nFor most of the recipes Honeybee[+] loads 2 * number of hours * number of blind state for each test point. The 2 is there because it loads the results for total and direct contribution separately. If you don't have dynamic blinds use the Annual recipe which is a flavor of daylight coefficient recipe that doesn't load the results to memory and just calculates the annual metrics.\n\n\n\nLet me know what is your goal and we can take it from there.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "6 hours ago", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nSince I\u00b4m not using any BSDF for this calc, and have just one state (unshaded)- cause of huge overhangs, I\u00b4m using Daylight coefitients. BUT, since I want to show the contribution of each facade + skylight I divided them into groups, that\u00b4s the reason of the size + compare the results with Daysim.\n\nIt\u00b4s not crucial,\u00a0I\u00b4m just interested where are the limits\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1806438", "name": "PZ_DC_gridbased.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Peter Za\u0165ko", "created_at": "5 hours ago", "created_by": "PeterZatko", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nWe can and we will get to the place to handle large files like this. There are a couple of items that needs to be addressed before we get there.\n\n\n\nFor comparison studies to Daysim you should use the Annual Recipe. That is using the daylight coefficient recipe to run the analysis and similar to the Daysim workflow it doesn't load the results for each test point for calculating the annual metrics.\n\n\n\nHere is the good news. If you copy your current files under the annual folder and change the recipe to annual and leave reuseMtx to True the component will read the results without re-running the analysis. That should give you the option to compare the values. No window group is supported though.\n\n\n\nAs I said there are solutions to be developed for specific cases.
