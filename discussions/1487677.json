{"body": "\nHi Guys,\n\n<br/>I'm setting up an energy simulation where I look at the heat gain from solar radiation. The simulation runs and I'm getting data for all of my windows, however EpSurfResult won't color them. It may have to do with me splitting the wall surfaces to give me two separate windows, but I'm not sure. I checked to make sure that the surfaces in question were labelled as windows in my zones as well.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nJohn\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1487676", "name": "HUB Project Inter.gh"}], "created_by_name": "John Keyes", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 11:17am", "created_by": "JohnKeyes", "topic": "Windows not being colored from ReadEpSurfResult", "replies": [{"body": "\nI can't recreate the error. Can you try to set recallHBHive_ to True. That might be the issue. Just to give you a heads up, in the new version the component is using a different method and recallHBHive is removed.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/a0gZpI6iXIKeGvhUlzg3QjWxNMbKtFNNA4MVe1fM730Y63T9GdGk9QHU938-uy9RH8wozOPlXkIS*JRqutjacetjpi8K0Afb/color_glazing.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/a0gZpI6iXIKeGvhUlzg3QjWxNMbKtFNNA4MVe1fM730Y63T9GdGk9QHU938-uy9RH8wozOPlXkIS*JRqutjacetjpi8K0Afb/color_glazing.jpg)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 19, 2016 at 8:46am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}
