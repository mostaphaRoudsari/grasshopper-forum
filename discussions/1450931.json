For a geometry like the one in screen-shot you start from curves in plan and then extrude curves. You can create the roof by doing the same but in front view. I suggest you to take some time and watch some modeling tutorials. It will eventually so much time and struggle.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 31, 2016 at 6:41pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Thank you so much for your reply.I am trying to do energy modelling of a single storeyed building and I have 2d model of that building in AutoCAD.I just need basic modelling tutorial of rhiono which is needed only for energy modelling purpose.I have maximum one month to complete this project.I have looked up in Youtube and found tons of tutorial.I am little bit confused \u00a0that which one should I go first.
