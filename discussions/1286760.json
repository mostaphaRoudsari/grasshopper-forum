{"body": "\nDear colleagues,\u00a0\n\nplease help to find the reason of next problem and fix the issue.\n\nI want to model simple light shelve for 1 room. I specified an annual simulation mode.\n\nThe problem that with and without light shelve the DLA value is similar. Please help to find the reason.\n\n[http://youtu.be/gq9vnTagYFw](http://youtu.be/gq9vnTagYFw)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1286759", "name": "1505141531.zip"}], "created_by_name": "Artem Zhukov", "created_at": "May 14, 2015 at 9:18am", "created_by": "ArtemZhukov", "topic": "Light shelves annual daylighting modelling", "replies": [{"body": "\nI would check the Rad parameters.

Since it is such a small place I would just recommend to use Honeybee's medium or even higher quality. It takes care of a lot of Radiance settings. Also you can have a grid of 0.1 or smth. Press simulate and have a coffee.\n\n<br/>Speaking of coffee I haven't had mine yet, there is a roof right? :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 14, 2015 at 7:43pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n:) Nice\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Artem Zhukov", "created_at": "May 15, 2015 at 2:40am", "created_by": "ArtemZhukov", "replies": []}]}]}
