It's usually a matter of unblocking the GHPython.gha file. If the file is already unblocked then make sure Rhino is also updated. That should solve the problem. There are couple of similar discussions like this on the group.\n\nFrom Rhino 6 Python component will come as default Grasshopper component. That should make our life much easier. :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 26, 2015 at 8:14am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nNoted with many thanks, Mostapha!\n\n\n\nI forgot that you and Marios have provided the suggestion in this regard:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/urgent-dupl...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/urgent-duplicate-installation-and-unusable-components)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 26, 2015 at 8:21am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nDid it work?

GhPython in the WIP has priority over other manually-installed add-ons, so it will be possible to have two different versions, one for Rhino 5 and one for the WIP and future versions.\n\nGiulio<br/>--<br/>Giulio Piacentino<br/>for Robert McNeel &amp; Associates<br/>giulio@mcneel.com\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Piacentino", "created_at": "August 26, 2015 at 8:57am", "created_by": "GiulioPiacentino", "replies": []}]}]}
