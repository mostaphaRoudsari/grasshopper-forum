{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nmy colleagues and I tried to run a daylight autonomy simulation in a shoe box shape room and it worked...\n\nNow that we are applying the same script to a bigger scale building, composed of more complex geometries, nothing works anymore and the output is weird: every test point has the same value (97% DA) and it's impossible to visualize these values even if a text tag 3D is assigned to points (check Result.jpg)\n\nThe output that we get is a uniform mesh.\u00a0\n\nTo check this output we also run an illuminance analysis using the same test surface, giving 300lux as high and low bound and some areas didn't reach the target value - which means that there must be some areas below that threshold.\n\n\n\nAnother thing: as you can see from Screenshot.jpg at one point we get the string saying *.dgp not found. Is that a problem?\n\n\n\nAttached you can find the Grasshopper file.\n\n\n\nThank you all!\n\n\n\nSimone\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1424686", "name": "Result.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1424687", "name": "Screenshot.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1424688", "name": "Daylight Autonomy Simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Simone Bevilacqua", "created_at": "December 21, 2015 at 9:51am", "created_by": "SimoneBevilacqua", "topic": "Wrong output values for Daylight Autonomy simulation", "replies": [{"body": "\nI haven't checked the file but based on your results it looks like all the points are outdoor under the sky.
