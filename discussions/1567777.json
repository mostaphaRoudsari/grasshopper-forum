{"body": "\nI love the auto-zoning feature in HB which generates floors and perimeter zones for you. It works well for towers. Now I am trying to figure out how to assign daysim dimming schedules I generated for a single floor, 5 zone model, to the North, East, West and South zones of the tower without having to list out each zone on each exposure and pass it through a schedules assignment component. Any efficiencies here? Many thanks again.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Arpan Bakshi", "created_at": "July 18, 2016 at 11:07am", "created_by": "ArpanBakshi", "topic": "Custom schedules for towers", "replies": [{"body": "\nArpan,\n\nCan't check right now but i would look for the HB_separateZonesByOrientation component.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 18, 2016 at 2:09pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nIf none of the zones has windows in two different directions then Abraham's solution should work perfectly.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 18, 2016 at 2:24pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nOf course.\n\nWish: Check which orientation has the biggest window so it will be the orientation choosen (or the sum of the areas of the windows in that wall).\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 18, 2016 at 2:36pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1567777"}
