{"body": "\nHello everybody!\n\n\n\nI've been trying to run an E+ Simulation for a single room. I've generated a custom shading and used it as \"shdSurface\" for the \"HB_EPContextSrf\" component. The Simulation does run, but once it finished I get this error message:\n\n1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/>\u00a0\u00a0 ** Severe\u00a0 ** GetSurfaceData: There are 50 degenerate surfaces; Degenerate surfaces are those with number of sides &lt; 3.\n\n\n\nCan sombody tell me how to find the degenerate surfaces and get rid of them?\n\n\n\nI attached the gh.-file and I'm using the \"Small objects - meters\" template for Rhino, in case that's important.\n\n\n\nThanks in anvance\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1434586", "name": "E+ Simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "S221B", "created_at": "January 8, 2016 at 12:39pm", "created_by": "S221B", "topic": "E+ context surface error", "replies": [{"body": "\nS221B,\n\nIn my opinion you are approaching this wrongly. There are a couple of options:\n\n1. As you did, but you are modeling the blind with thickness. If you keep with this approach just stick with a plain surface (re-model the profile just as one curve and not as a profile. The profile is what is \"killing\" the simulation, even though you get results.\n\n2. Using the native HB_EPWindowShades which will give you all you need, i think.\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 9, 2016 at 1:04am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nHello Abraham,\n\nsadly, I won't be able to use the native HB_EPWindowShades, since I'm trying to compare different kinds of custom shadings.\n\nSo, I'll try your first idea.\n\n\n\nThank you\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "S221B", "created_at": "January 11, 2016 at 1:47am", "created_by": "S221B", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nInteresting ...\n\nI wonder what kind of shading devices do you want to check that EPWindowShades can't take.
