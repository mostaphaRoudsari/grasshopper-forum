Not the flux (Energy per unit area). \u00a0So you just need one more step in order to convert the values to kBTU/ft2. \u00a0Also, I might recommend using the recolor mesh so that you can more easily set the legend bounds bu the create legend component is a fine solution as well.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/OKuVBbfwBdF3KMEF-kOv7UUQwZmHhZUrzDpxdBc8b333og3ORDXWLE*N*lexM*9Et9uaXLu8xgW95QBosgv3r-9u8f01vmkj/kBTUperFT2.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/OKuVBbfwBdF3KMEF-kOv7UUQwZmHhZUrzDpxdBc8b333og3ORDXWLE*N*lexM*9Et9uaXLu8xgW95QBosgv3r-9u8f01vmkj/kBTUperFT2.JPG)\n\nI should also note that the\u00a0WH2BTU component is smart enough to convert EUI (also energy per unit area) for energy model results as long as there's a Ladybug header on the data. \u00a0But, by default, it's only doing an energy unit conversion.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 12, 2017 at 10:05pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks for the response.
