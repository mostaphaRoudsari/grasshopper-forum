people would use the dataLabePt of a stacked chart like this to label the sum of all energy use or energy load but I could be wrong. \u00a0I can put in a tree branch of points for the different stacked bars if you think it would help. \u00a0In the meantime, you can just use the native GH \"Move\" component to create two more copies of the points to align with the input data.\n\n-Chris\n",
