{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and group members,\n\n\n\nI made a model with variable shape and window rate. I would like to use Galapagos to optimize the \u00a0shape and window rate for lowest energy consumption.\n\nHere is three questions\uff1a\n\n1. As the optimization goes, more and more errors of zones appeared, and the line of Galapagos seemed confusing.\n\n2. When I checked the result again with the push of bottom \"Reinstate\", the previous \u00a0total energy calculation turned \"undefined\".\n\n3. The error is all about \"All of your HBSrfs must make a closed volume\".\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/xE1-ufgwx-9jHr07dHUuhR-OtJ4PScN0W1ebvGeQd6RoYfcf4su*oLHKQM3WCtQh*7Ae78xviuLygD3BysBRl9XWdTtaLE*Y/QQ20161117010135.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/xE1-ufgwx-9jHr07dHUuhR-OtJ4PScN0W1ebvGeQd6RoYfcf4su*oLHKQM3WCtQh*7Ae78xviuLygD3BysBRl9XWdTtaLE*Y/QQ20161117010135.png)\n\nI attached the gh file.

Intersection can change based on the tolerance values. If you can set up a higher tolerance that works with your model that should help avoiding the crash. If your model is simple enough then I suggest to develop your own code to create the geometry and use Honeybee to create the zones and run the analysis.\n\nAlso in some cases it has been an issue with the memory. I have recently made major modification to Honeybee to address the memory issue. If you update to the version available on GitHub you can test it with the new version.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 17, 2016 at 6:19am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nDear Mostapha,\n\nSure.
