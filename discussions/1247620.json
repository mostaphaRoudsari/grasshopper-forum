I ran Octopus since last night and I connected 12 lists of data that I wanted to export to the pollination component as a data tree with branches. additionally I connected the file name to a slider, so I can keep each configuration to a separate file. Pollination created .csv files, the files have 12 different data separated by comma, however,pollination recorded the first value in the list, for example I have an hourly list of mean radiant temp. that list has over 8000 values, in the .csv I get one value from this list, I'm guessing it is the first value in the list. Another example, I have a daylighting autonomy list that has about 300 values (the grid nodes values) and again in the .csv file I see only one value. Is it supposed to be this way?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nRania\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "March 22, 2015 at 12:52pm", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Rania,\n\nI use Excel Write component from Lunchbox ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/lunchbox](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/lunchbox)). Use the recorder component to record all the values you require and then after the MOO is complete, export it into Excel using that component. It has a limitation of 5 inputs, you can use multiples of it and export to several sheets and simply copy all the values into one sheet OR determine which column number to start at for each set you export and export them all into one sheet.\n\nCheers!\n\nYassin\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yassin Ashour", "created_at": "March 22, 2015 at 1:51pm", "created_by": "YassinAshour450", "replies": [{"body": "\nTT Toolbox has a write to Excel component that does not have a limitation of the number of inputs (that I know of).
