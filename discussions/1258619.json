Seems to be that you updated the file using the HB_Update component. This usually works well, but when the the updated version of the component has more input/output items it doesn't, even though it appears it was updated.\n\nYou can tell when you get errors like this one.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 7, 2015 at 9:41pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nA,\n\n\n\nThanks!
