Then, i set write idf to yes and idf file was written successfully. However, after i set run energy plus to yes,\u00a0the result message said that no weather file was attached. How to solve this problem? what step have i missed?\u00a0\n\nThank you...\n\natika\n\n\n\n\n\n<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/p5H7N8Ot6oORKBnO*uJ187B2glMXGDflZ5NETE8LSnD3COxaJI3-Sy3EuG01LO2KFt9qUf0uvo1IjkWcWpUPlQABn8VHtsin/writeidf.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/p5H7N8Ot6oNuyusa9U3RAqsMZEAA798LdQu50acGjWIO76*u07VMU-3aI5QKh57V5orpExSE-5tVX56xI1WV8RdsHmvP67nd/Picture1.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/p5H7N8Ot6oNuyusa9U3RAqsMZEAA798LdQu50acGjWIO76*u07VMU-3aI5QKh57V5orpExSE-5tVX56xI1WV8RdsHmvP67nd/Picture1.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "atika nur fitriana", "created_at": "June 16, 2014 at 8:38pm", "created_by": "atikanurfitriana", "topic": "No weather file attached Issue in honeybee (E+)", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Atika,\n\nWhere did you get your weather file?

But when compare my weather file with the weather file from energy plus, both of them were identical, so the problem wasn't about the weather file. And when I move the weather file to another folder, It failed again.\n\nSo the problem is about the name of the folder, if we put our weather file inside folder c:\\New Folder (for example), our simulation will failed, but if we put our weather file in c:\\New_Folder or c:\\newFolder or something else without spacing, It will worked.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Agus Hariyadi", "created_at": "June 18, 2014 at 8:37am", "created_by": "kirpytus", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks for the good answer, Agus. \u00a0You are right about that and I can tell you that it results from the finicky nature of E+ and the fact that the creators of E+ have not put in any functionality for filenames with spaces in them. \u00a0I can also say that E+ only likes file paths where you have \\ between folders and not / so watch out for that one too!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 23, 2014 at 6:57pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nGod damn it I love these forums.\n\n\n\nBack to work.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 31, 2015 at 5:42am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nThanks for the solution....\u00a0\n\nThat worked for me, after i moved the weather file to weather data energy plus folder.
