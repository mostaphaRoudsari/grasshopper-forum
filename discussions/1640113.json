{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to use the SplitMass component in Honeybee to create core and perimeter zones for a randomized geometry. For some shapes, I get an error that \"The script has failed to create one of the zones because of a tolerance issue. Try changing your Rhino Model's tolerance (probably try increasing and recompute the GH definition to generate zones correctly.\"\n\nIncreasing the absolute tolerance to 0.08 gives a single zone, but anything less than that gives the above error with some zones missing. Since the component is generating some perimeter zones and a core, I know the zone is deep enough where I shouldn't model it as a single zone, but there doesn't seem to be a sweet-spot in between. Has anyone else come across this issue?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nArfa\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1640112", "name": "Randomized Form.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Arfa Aijazi", "created_at": "November 15, 2016 at 10:13am", "created_by": "ArfaAijazi", "topic": "SplitMass Tolerance", "replies": [{"body": "\nBump!
