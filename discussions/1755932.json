{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nFolks I am confused.\u00a0 Please help clarify what is the difference between the 'Sunlight hour analysis' done via LB vs 'Shadow range study' done using HB/ Radiance.\n\n\n\nOn Hydra I found a\u00a0'Sunlight hour analysis' script which uses a LB component. (see screen capture 1 below).\u00a0 This gave me a wonderful butterfly diagram so I can explain how many hours of sunlight the street or plaza etc will get.\u00a0 (see screen capture 2 below)\n\n\n\nNext on Hydra I found the 'Shadow range study' which uses HB (see screen capture 3 below).\u00a0 I saw a you tube video where Mostapha showed how to run this script (see screen capture 4 below).\u00a0 I was able to run the script and get a HDR image.\n\n\n\nMy question is what is the difference between these two?\u00a0 Can I extract any sunlight/ shadow values from the HB HDR image or is this just a pretty looking visual?\u00a0 I mean how is this informing my design?\u00a0 What should I learn from it.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1755929", "name": "Capture1.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1755930", "name": "Capture2.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1755931", "name": "Capture3.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Ibby", "created_at": "May 22, 2017 at 11:53am", "created_by": "Ibby", "topic": "Sunlight hour analysi LB vs Shadow range study HB", "replies": [{"body": "\nScreen Capture 4 attached.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1755686", "name": "Capture4.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Ibby", "created_at": "May 22, 2017 at 11:54am", "created_by": "Ibby", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThe sunlightHourAnalysis allows you to get the butterfly diagram you (and everyone) like.\n\nThe shadow range study (via HB) allows you to produce individual images for each requested hour.\n\nWhat you learn from any of them?
