{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI received an interesting question today about unrolling the colored mesh. The best way that I found is to create a joined Brep from the Mesh, Unroll it, re-create the mesh, and re-color it.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/XK5BrsN2RVe4wyO6wpc7JN0brVrxqDQ89NRzJ-S13gqZVJweMzKcLEthpIktttXGTvGtpwFDLAZwHz349g4JeGIax7izsby8/unrollResultMesh.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/XK5BrsN2RVe4wyO6wpc7JN0brVrxqDQ89NRzJ-S13gqZVJweMzKcLEthpIktttXGTvGtpwFDLAZwHz349g4JeGIax7izsby8/unrollResultMesh.png)\n\n\n\nIt works but it's probably not the most efficient way of doing this. Is there a better way that I'm missing?\n\nThanks,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A996122", "name": "unrollLadybugColoredMesh.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 23, 2014 at 8:08pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "topic": "Unroll Colored Mesh", "replies": []}
