{"body": "\nHello guys,\n\n\n\nI'm still here questioning how to see the end of the tunnel.\n\nIn fact, after setted up all the parameters and schedules, I got that during winter the kW of heating are zero during the operative hours. I'm not able to figure out why, can you help me?\n\n\n\nThanks a lot,\n\nMarco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marco P", "created_at": "February 10, 2015 at 10:32pm", "created_by": "MarcoP", "topic": "Energy Simulation_Heating issue", "replies": [{"body": "\nHey,\n\nI cannot make it to run.
