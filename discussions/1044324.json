{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nAs I continue my attempt do the 3 types of analysis required by the UK's Rights of Light\u00a0\n\nusing LB and HB, (and replace Ecotect), I have some more questions.\n\n\n\nSo far it seems that the VSC is already there, I now try to understand the APSH as described in the **\"BRE_Site Playout Planning for Daylight &amp; Sunlight (2011)\".**\n\n\n\nMy understanding is that I need to use sunlightHoursAnalysis within the period of 21 Sept - 21 March?\n\n\n\nBut maybe I am completely wrong...\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for the advice.\n\n\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1044323", "name": "APSH _Test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "April 14, 2014 at 4:28pm", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Annual Probable Sunlight Hours (APSH)", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Dimitrios,\n\n\n\nI'm not an expert in BRE standards so I don't know what is the analysis period based on the code; but back to your question to calculate sunlight hours for\u00a021 Sept -21 March the attached file was correct. I just did three minor modifications:\n\n\n\n1. If you are using analysisPeriod input then hour, day and month component will be disabled. As you can see in the attached file I removed day, month and hour inputs and it just works fine.\n\n\n\n2. Make sure you are using the same timeStep for sunlightHours and sunpath components. I just connected the same slider to both inputs. You can go as accurate as a minute but it may take a while to calculate!\n\n\n\n3. Set parallel to True so the component will use all the CPUs for the calculation. It makes a big difference if you run the analysis for so many test points.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1044232", "name": "APSH_Test_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 14, 2014 at 6:54pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks a lot!\n\nVery helpful.\n\n\n\nWhen I manage to relate the LB and HB to the specifics of the Rights of Lights I will send you and you can review.\n\n\n\nMaybe have them online as examples for this specific task, as it s something all the UK based projects need to use, when proposing new schemes.\n\n\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "April 15, 2014 at 8:15am", "created_by": "doompop", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nTo have the example online is such a great idea.
