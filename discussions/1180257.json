One is to use one of the other more advanced meshing tools in Grasshopper to generate a better mesh. If you don't want to do that what I usually do is to generate test points using evaluate surface and color surfaces instead of a mesh. I attached an example.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/51GNwYDFQ0RKpbW43QEGhFpf5Iy2VlBkvkBmN8UEgf0ZJPXCTAKU*kHDIKdHhuWvFN9ZcvdkAuUxtA7TZ2A33ekqQNJVEQ5g/generateTestPoints.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/51GNwYDFQ0RKpbW43QEGhFpf5Iy2VlBkvkBmN8UEgf0ZJPXCTAKU*kHDIKdHhuWvFN9ZcvdkAuUxtA7TZ2A33ekqQNJVEQ5g/generateTestPoints.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1180686", "name": "testPtsOnCircle.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 3, 2014 at 6:51pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks as always for your rapid answers. I usually get the mesh directly from the architect, so any option where I don't have to re-make the mesh would be preferred. Your solution is another good one - thanks.
