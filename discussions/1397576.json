{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nWhen I tried use the \"Grizzly Bear\" gbXML export component of Honeybee, I am getting a warning message indicating that Grizzly Bear Vector Math Dependency and Grizzly Bear Serializer Dependency cannot be found. The error log includes a Drop Box link to download these libraries, but the links are not useful, they are broken. How can I obtain these libraries to start using the Grizzly Bear components.\n\n\n\nHere is the error log that pops up on the upper right corner of the Honeybee component\n\n1. Cannot find Grizzly Bear Vector Math Dependency. You can download the libraries from the link below. Copy the file to C:\\gbXML\n\n2.

I downloaded the required DLLs and Grizzly Bear component is showing no errors. However, due to some reason, it is not logging anything. I am trying to export only the surrounding context of a building as a gbXML file. It should be fairly straightforward. Any comments why this problem could happen? Please see the screenshot of my Grasshopper set-up attached. Thank you.\n\nOmer T.

I was trying to export only the HB Context without the HB Zones. I need to use the optimized surrounding geometry for a building model in Design Builder. It seems that we need have both (Context + Zones) to successfully export gbXML files out of Honeybee. Best.\n\nOmer T.
