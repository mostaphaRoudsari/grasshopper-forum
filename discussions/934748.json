{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI just started fiddling around with Ladybug. I'm trying to plot the radiation during the day on a curved surface. So, I want to calculate 24 values, one for each hour, of kWh/m2 for the entire surface. I want to graph this, so I expect some kind of peak radiation during the day. I want to do this as a cumulative value for an entire year (so still 24 values).\n\n\n\nIs this possible in Ladybug?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Diederik Veenendaal", "created_at": "October 18, 2013 at 9:18am", "created_by": "DiederikVeenendaal", "topic": "Cumulative hourly radiation", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Diederik,\n\nThe short answer is yes you can do it but with the current released version which is uses genCumulativeSky to generate the sky it might fail. GenCumulativeSky has some bugs for hourly studies (check this\u00a0[discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/radiation-calculation-problem) as an example).\n\nThis is a perfect examples for what I have recently implemented to Ladybug. Using gendaymtx makes it extremely easy to do.
