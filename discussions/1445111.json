It's because a number of vectors are almost parallel to the surface. I suggest to study a single day before using the shading designer for an analysis period. That should help you to understand the process behind calculating shadings.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 5, 2016 at 11:58pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nMostapha, Do you think there should be check for this?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 2:00pm", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1445111"}
