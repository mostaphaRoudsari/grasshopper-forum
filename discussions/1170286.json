{"body": "\nHi all,\u00a0\n\nI have created some custom constructions for roofs and walls and saved them in the Energy plus library using the component \"Add to EnegyPlus Library component\". However, every single time I open the grasshopper file I need to create the customized constructions again, as the program doesnt seem to remember them. Is there any way to keep them in the library permanently?\u00a0\n\nAlejandro\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "November 17, 2014 at 9:00am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Create custom constructions in HB", "replies": [{"body": "\nAlejandro,\n\nUsing the 'Add to EnergyPlus Library' component will only add the construction to the memory of the Rhino document that you have open. \u00a0Not your hard copy of constructions. \u00a0Mostapha gives instructions for how to add constructions into your permanent library on this thread:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-material...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-material-construction-schedule-library)\n\nI hope that helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 17, 2014 at 1:26pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nNote that by\u00a0LadybugFolderOnYourMachine, Mostapha means either C:\\Ladybug or\u00a0C:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 17, 2014 at 1:28pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nCool, thanks again!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "November 18, 2014 at 1:08am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "jP Trujillo Levy", "created_at": "July 17, 2016 at 12:38pm", "created_by": "JuanPabloTrujilloLevy", "replies": []}]}
