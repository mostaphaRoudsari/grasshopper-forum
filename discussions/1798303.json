{"body": "\nHi,\n\nSomething weird is happening with the HB_readEPSrfResult.\n\nI'm getting the results from the simulation and connect the to the readEPSrfResult. It is not showing any error but none of the output items are giving any result.\n\nMoreover, some of the outputs are missing, for instance surfaceEnergyFlow, which is weird since i have external surfaces (and windows).\n\nOf course the HB_EPOutput is set to produce surface results.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UzNxsQaT08ZaeQmP-l2sS9dMkVVwkHn0sRiVW5zJeMUwFoux7JtwIrJv2JibeudAu7NdElGt6vSBNM2M21csx2JJfxK9JyC0/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UzNxsQaT08ZaeQmP-l2sS9dMkVVwkHn0sRiVW5zJeMUwFoux7JtwIrJv2JibeudAu7NdElGt6vSBNM2M21csx2JJfxK9JyC0/Capture.JPG)I have another file where this works fine (at the same working session). The only difference is that there is only one zone, and here i have many (which i don't believe should be a problem).\n\nThe folder where the results are is well populated, specially i have a in.eio in there (120kb).\n\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 14, 2017 at 8:40am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "[solved]readEPSrfResult - Results missing", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 14, 2017 at 8:45am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nQuick response!!\n\nAttached.
