{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostafa, great tool! Really helpful and I love it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am testing Solar radiation on geometry for annual period and also for 4 seasons.\u00a0\n\nNow when we compare two pictures, one with annual analysis and another with winter period, colors are almost same. Just an amount of radiation kWh/m2 is naturally higher or lower.\u00a0\n\nWhat I want to acomplish, is constant legend colors, from 100 - 1200 kWh/m2 for all calculation periods. Maybe with more segments.\u00a0\n\nThen would I get more blue to yellow coloring of winter period and more yellow to red for Summer.\u00a0\n\nThis way is better for understanding amount of radiation in different periods.\u00a0\n\nIs it possible now or is it just my wish.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\u00a0\n\n\n\nIgor\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AwOyT6gC1eH2iYX7HVFTnshTGxuq5yq8JZmQSWLgUF7L6UsVlZYoeMAN7*dLzblb12wAn1fpHLnppJoTHcmcTTq-M92BE3cy/WinterCase.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AwOyT6gC1eH2iYX7HVFTnshTGxuq5yq8JZmQSWLgUF7L6UsVlZYoeMAN7*dLzblb12wAn1fpHLnppJoTHcmcTTq-M92BE3cy/WinterCase.jpg)\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AwOyT6gC1eEaXocHGrr8W66pVRI7xOVwpShfjeG2hHW7Rx4pldPOjNGoV8TBzmPnESD9BWmPnUFWZ4xQV1M*0I0IENH590Mn/annual.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AwOyT6gC1eEaXocHGrr8W66pVRI7xOVwpShfjeG2hHW7Rx4pldPOjNGoV8TBzmPnESD9BWmPnUFWZ4xQV1M*0I0IENH590Mn/annual.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A876004", "name": "annual.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A876005", "name": "Winter Case.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Igor Mitri\u0107 Lavovski", "created_at": "June 22, 2013 at 12:16pm", "created_by": "Igor425", "topic": "Solar Radiation Legend Parameters", "replies": [{"body": "\nReply to myself!\n\nAnnual solar radiation calculates total radiation in kWh to m2 during a year. What is for Graz 1130\u00a0kWh/m2.\n\nThat is why I get red color on some places. It is max. radiation in a year.\u00a0\n\nWhen I change legend segment to more, 24 for example,then I menage change legend colors but now I always get just blue parts of gradient. Because now during a 3 month period every part of geometry gets no more than\u00a0400\u00a0kWh/m2.\u00a0\n\nConclusion : Wrong Question!!!\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AwOyT6gC1eGyQr-mTIzTUDKXjEBIoVqawvLWfqhuGzYpq3lEtql1HSMfrJDPrSkeJjDZrFnSncylLwFv6o6H5*y9Y3Psx20*/WinterII.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AwOyT6gC1eGyQr-mTIzTUDKXjEBIoVqawvLWfqhuGzYpq3lEtql1HSMfrJDPrSkeJjDZrFnSncylLwFv6o6H5*y9Y3Psx20*/WinterII.jpg)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AwOyT6gC1eGp-9BpooNdMY6o2UxQcryPQXV*4B2ORgAm*SPAUF1Lk3PyBi7W74GMtpdQDbeSWdz3sXjqCCZCtonwVnrCCjJ1/Spring.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AwOyT6gC1eGp-9BpooNdMY6o2UxQcryPQXV*4B2ORgAm*SPAUF1Lk3PyBi7W74GMtpdQDbeSWdz3sXjqCCZCtonwVnrCCjJ1/Spring.jpg)\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Igor Mitri\u0107 Lavovski", "created_at": "June 22, 2013 at 1:35pm", "created_by": "Igor425", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Igor.
