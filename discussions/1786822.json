{"body": "\nHi everyone! I'm trying to do ad integrated daylight and energy simulation. I've got a simple room with floor, ceiling and 3 walls adiabatic. Only one isn't adiabatic and it has 2 windows on it. To set the elements I used CreateHBsrfs and I added \"Adiabatic\" in the EPBC input. Since the EnergyPlus results weren't what I expected, I checked the idf file and I discovered none of the element is adiabatic. Furthermore, the simulation doesn't use the materials I set up for the not-adiabatic wall.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" height=\"94\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/gENxVTfXsZ9tnklMhycSbWoAMMyrof*zSj9QAZ69zFbOhGI2Ogvd9WYNsrzg6xqIKRSe3cHEty01oj5v46b4tba3H*EiYaMF/Buildingsurface.PNG?width=750\" width=\"618\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/gENxVTfXsZ9tnklMhycSbWoAMMyrof*zSj9QAZ69zFbOhGI2Ogvd9WYNsrzg6xqIKRSe3cHEty01oj5v46b4tba3H*EiYaMF/Buildingsurface.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI even tryed with MakeAdiabatic, MakeAdiabaticbyname and MakeAdiabaticbytype. <br/>With the first and second the problem is still the same. <br/>With MakeAdiabaticbyType, if I change one wall type in the CreateHBsrfs, it still remains the same type in EnergyPlus, so it makes all the walls adiabatic. <br/><br/>Is there something I can do? <br/>I attach the GH file <br/>Thanks in advance <br/><br/>Lisa\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1786821", "name": "IEA_18 07 2017_EPSimulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Lisa", "created_at": "July 20, 2017 at 2:44am", "created_by": "Lisa216", "topic": "Adiabatic elements, Energy plus simulation", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi,\n\nThe open office program overrides boundary conditions assigned by you.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/gENxVTfXsZ9Ls8zAohOQeK64n017Xj6igN7OH77Pb*geqlOQtBK4n4NWUkApGQG-cjVvZxJ5BkZGENuoPyjRQC4-qnyFLDpl/BC.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/gENxVTfXsZ9Ls8zAohOQeK64n017Xj6igN7OH77Pb*geqlOQtBK4n4NWUkApGQG-cjVvZxJ5BkZGENuoPyjRQC4-qnyFLDpl/BC.png)\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1786634", "name": "IEA_18072017_EPSimulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "July 20, 2017 at 3:35am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "\nLisa,\n\nTo second Devang, there's no need to use the \"Masses2Zones\" component in your file. \u00a0You are already creating the zone with the \"createHBZones\" component and there's no need to re-create it afterwards. \u00a0Just plug your zoneProgram to the\u00a0\"createHBZones\" component and things should work as you expect.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 25, 2017 at 10:40pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHI!
