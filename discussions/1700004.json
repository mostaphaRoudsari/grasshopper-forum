However, the daysim annual simulation would not run possibly due to a bug in the .hea file.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5Ki514VgtQySjfpP9wSqv5Z-TirzihRWUyX6PCguUEdbi*pAKJbNSrgFE32QXjrq7AlMDEFe-04k9Jj5gfLF4cGq4gkx87Vq/4.JPG?width=750\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5Ki514VgtQySjfpP9wSqv5Z-TirzihRWUyX6PCguUEdbi*pAKJbNSrgFE32QXjrq7AlMDEFe-04k9Jj5gfLF4cGq4gkx87Vq/4.JPG)\n\n\n\nthe following is the shading control part of my .hea file generated from honeybee. I believe the 1 underneath represents the number of the states I input. When I switch both of the \"1\" within the .hea. The batch files would start the process but there is another bug for the **gen_gdp_profile**. It was having problem with .oct that it is looking for **outside_daysim.rad** which is not exist in the tmp within the folder.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am still running the gen_dc and I will update it over if I encounter any error after editing the .hea file.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5Ki514VgtQxOIAJivy6w5ql-KW18otGL03uoXjl2KoN9-2mrQZHxi9P2VgcPtAAjWq*K-MzjP5bLNeDT3Q-XHvIOeRcJq7MQ/5.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5Ki514VgtQxOIAJivy6w5ql-KW18otGL03uoXjl2KoN9-2mrQZHxi9P2VgcPtAAjWq*K-MzjP5bLNeDT3Q-XHvIOeRcJq7MQ/5.JPG)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5Ki514VgtQy*U5mRZMRz6KP71O32G1VKzCjhQvIXPZ*10TH*pwrXXG790SeAVyfVsJYkzaEeGJrCrOP*x*XUuhu32D3VOI4x/6.JPG\" width=\"656\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5Ki514VgtQy*U5mRZMRz6KP71O32G1VKzCjhQvIXPZ*10TH*pwrXXG790SeAVyfVsJYkzaEeGJrCrOP*x*XUuhu32D3VOI4x/6.JPG)[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5Ki514VgtQxOIAJivy6w5ql-KW18otGL03uoXjl2KoN9-2mrQZHxi9P2VgcPtAAjWq*K-MzjP5bLNeDT3Q-XHvIOeRcJq7MQ/5.JPG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5Ki514VgtQw5R2OaatuCkMJs*3WSE81RIbAVGbJ6AwrGJw*-G3e4*Sz8wziYk8hSO9f9pAeTZ0*Cy49GkiIwcoYgGq979YNo/7.JPG\" width=\"680\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5Ki514VgtQw5R2OaatuCkMJs*3WSE81RIbAVGbJ6AwrGJw*-G3e4*Sz8wziYk8hSO9f9pAeTZ0*Cy49GkiIwcoYgGq979YNo/7.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Willy Tsui", "created_at": "February 25, 2017 at 12:43am", "created_by": "WillyTsui", "topic": "Error in DS parameters with 2 shading states.", "replies": [{"body": "\nThe error doesn't seem to have anything with using the states.
