{"body": "\nHi Everyone\n\n\n\nI an new to grasshopper and new to honeybee. I have created a room with numerous perforations in rhino. I was wondering how I could map the thermal grid within the room in grasshopper. I have been trying to follow 4th grid script example you guys posted but I just wasn't able to follow the reasons behind it, can any of you put me through the step by step process of how i would approach this. The design im using is attached below.\n\n\n\nThanks alot\u00a0\n\nDennis\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1174995", "name": "Capture.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Dennis", "created_at": "November 24, 2014 at 7:43pm", "created_by": "Dennis", "topic": "Interior Grid Analysis", "replies": [{"body": "\nIt's easier to help if you also post your definition and rhino file (or just internalize any geometry you're referencing from rhino).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Stasiuk", "created_at": "November 25, 2014 at 1:56am", "created_by": "DavidStasiuk", "replies": [{"body": "\nhere is the script I have been working on\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1175610", "name": "new.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dennis", "created_at": "November 25, 2014 at 9:14am", "created_by": "Dennis", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nOk so the following scripts are the files that i looked at as reference to try and develop my script. 004 and 000.

So i go for making your example work.\n\nFor starters your model units were in feet. I believe you need to work in meters (or at least this is the recommendation). I did it and i can see the model is a small box ...\n\nI need to say also that the size of the windows is tiny. In this case i don't think tiny is good. Probably you are doing this task parametrically.\n\nThe following thing is that you set the whole model for the test points. I'm not sure if this makes a good sense and you intended in this way. I selected the floor and used only it as the test surface.\n\nAdded a few components to the right to visualize results and updated some others.\n\n\n\nHope it helps.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1175552", "name": "new_A.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 25, 2014 at 11:47am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n\"I believe you need to work in meters\"\n\nThat is true, however for daylight analysis as far as everything is in the same units, and parameters are set correctly (e.g.-ad) it should work fine.\n\n\n\nDennis,\n\nHave you watched any of the Honeybee workshop videos for daylighting by any chance?
