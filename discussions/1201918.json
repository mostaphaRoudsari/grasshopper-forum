In the results from honeybee/ladybug, (or any analysis process I imagine), the default colors are created with a much wider range of values. I presume the legend is then created by an average of those values within a range. My point is that, with the analysis results, selecting objects by color in Illustrator is probably not a very effective workflow.\n\nI only tested this on my instance of rhino and Illustrator. mileage may vary.\n\n\n\nIn summation, at this point, it seems that the best way to get colored mesh faces, into illustrator, is to export the meshes, (which really ends up being the mesh face edges...curves), and bringing them into illustrator and running a quick script to swap the colors. \u00a0Once that is complete, you can then select ALL the objects, and change the stroke color/weight at once.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Hanley", "created_at": "January 13, 2015 at 4:08pm", "created_by": "ChrisHanley", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nGlad Human was of use to you in this workflow!
