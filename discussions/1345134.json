Some of them were not updated to the latest version, and when you use the update component you need to replace some of the components, for example when they have changed the number of inputs or outputs from the previous version.\u00a0\n\nI also added a component to add your customized EP materials and constructions to the library.\u00a0\n\nAfter these changes the simulation worked for me.\u00a0\n\nI hope that was useful.\u00a0\n\nRegards,\n\nAle\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1345156", "name": "APD_EnergyPLusHoneybee.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "August 18, 2015 at 6:39am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nJkanters,\n\nYour file is not updated at all.
