{"body": "\nHello fellow ladybuggers.\n\n\n\nAs a new user of ladybug I find it difficult to understand what all these awesome graphs and charts mean. I can try and make some sense out of all this, but I feel like I just don't have enough knowledge and experience on how to translate all this juiciness into meaningful conclusions that I can later on give my fellow architects or colleagues (better in a gentle manner, so their brains won't go to space).\n\n\n\nCan anyone suggest the books or maybe videos on YouTube or just share their experience here. I think it will be helpful to any new ladybugger.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "October 25, 2015 at 10:11pm", "created_by": "Timur582", "topic": "Learning materials on how to interpret and understand ladybug analysis data.", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Tim ,\u00a0\n\nthese videos for Mostapha &amp; Chris will help you to understand how to use ladybug &amp; honeybee plugin :\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0holrRypJilkFo-Dv4JsQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0holrRypJilkFo-Dv4JsQ)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6HWbF4UtdKdjbZ2tvwiCQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6HWbF4UtdKdjbZ2tvwiCQ)\n\nfrom my point of view, I think \u00a0you will need to read about basics of environmental design to know what you need to analyse , \u00a0why and what will you get from this analysis you have done \u00a0.\u00a0\n\ntry also to understand the inputs &amp; outputs of every Icon you use to avoid mistakes or errors .\u00a0\n\nwish you all the best,\n\nMona\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "October 26, 2015 at 7:21am", "created_by": "monarezk", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Tim,\n\n\n\nAs Mona said videos are a great place to start.
