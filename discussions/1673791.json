{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m studying solar radiance on facade building with Ladybug and I get some results that I think that\u2019s something wrong.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019d like to understand why this soo different results and why results so high. I configure something wrong?\n\n\n\n2. The results images has the some solar incidence color results for the four dates (21/03, 21/06, 23/09 e 21.12), but the sun are on different positions, the imagens could be different visual results too. I really don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing something wrong.\n\nExample 10:00am dates:\n\n\u00a021/03, 21/06, 23/09, 21/12\n\n\n\nSomeone could help me ?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nCamila\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1673789", "name": "Result Problems.pdf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1673790", "name": "RadiationAnalysis_Result Problems.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Camila Leone", "created_at": "January 17, 2017 at 2:32pm", "created_by": "CamilaLeone", "topic": "Ladybug Results Problem", "replies": [{"body": "\nI haven't checked your file but if you're running the simulation for a single hour the legend will be Wh/m2 and when it's for an analysis period it is **k**Wh/m2.

I think it got confused as a period from 10 to 10 is not exactly a period but an instant.\n\nIf you change it to an HOY it works\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/llVO6PYtbd6s9-BqBDjSnuSDPZVOlLGLF21Db1tKrOp9AUxAIt4q7ZYHVg8Xu2TBedCOr5Yky40q8vAmuLB6t6V6t3b*HWvz/HOY.PNG\" width=\"680\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/llVO6PYtbd6s9-BqBDjSnuSDPZVOlLGLF21Db1tKrOp9AUxAIt4q7ZYHVg8Xu2TBedCOr5Yky40q8vAmuLB6t6V6t3b*HWvz/HOY.PNG)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/llVO6PYtbd7Llf0J1vzAUgfsv28URPYzHW4axbH5TamvLG2GEKxoAUhuNg*2kd0YXlE-HJaFquCyUoTu8c95-0YcfLZ7HX5X/HOYdifference.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/llVO6PYtbd7Llf0J1vzAUgfsv28URPYzHW4axbH5TamvLG2GEKxoAUhuNg*2kd0YXlE-HJaFquCyUoTu8c95-0YcfLZ7HX5X/HOYdifference.PNG)\n\n\n\nYour results wont be the same as mine, as I didn't have an epw from Sao Paulo, so I used one from London\n\n\u00a0You will find the things I added grouped.
