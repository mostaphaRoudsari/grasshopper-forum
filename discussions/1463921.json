{"body": "\nHi all,\n\ncan anyone help me with this, maybe i don't know grasshopper so well, i searched the forum but could not find an answer yet:\n\nI try to paste 8760 values in a multi-line panel, but the panel can't fit all of them, only a part of them is pasted. Moreover, i enter the panel to \"manually\" write the rest of the values, but it doesn't allow for any extra lines, it looks like it is full. I tried different values, and it seems it can paste all 8760 values if they are one-digit numbers. Anyone know why? P.S. they are pasted from the attached excel.\u00a0\n\n\n\nthank you in advance!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1463920", "name": "equipment Living Room.csv"}], "created_by_name": "Iason Bournas", "created_at": "February 15, 2016 at 4:46pm", "created_by": "IasonBournas", "topic": "can't paste all 8760 values in multi-line panel", "replies": [{"body": "\nIason,\n\nI don't think that the GH team build the panel to handle such long lists of values as an input. \u00a0In your situation, I would just use the native Grasshopper 'Read File' component to read in the csv values like so:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNjUMgo1cDSa9*o4TrjQlQEU5ogVoXhEDebSOyMaKqJJQNybGjy**HSwGCIC0bbB38thLFyEyruQdez3BLC9pDEv/ParseCSV.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNjUMgo1cDSa9*o4TrjQlQEU5ogVoXhEDebSOyMaKqJJQNybGjy**HSwGCIC0bbB38thLFyEyruQdez3BLC9pDEv/ParseCSV.JPG)\n\nOr you could use a specialized excel reader like that which comes with TTToolbox:\n\n[http://www.food4rhino.com/project/tttoolbox?ufh](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/tttoolbox?ufh)\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1463704", "name": "ParseCSVFile.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 15, 2016 at 7:34pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\ni tried the native components as you show and the TT toolbox alternative and i get the list.
