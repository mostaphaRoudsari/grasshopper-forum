{"body": "\nHello team,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if I could request a simple component for Honeybee.\n\n\n\nSometimes, during the set up of the model, I will combine zones in order to set zone loads and parameters (e.g. same types of spaces in order to apply ASHRAE 189.1 lighting power densities). However, the output of the set loads component (in this case) gives zones as referenced breps which makes it hard to decompose them.\n\n\n\nI was wondering if a component could be created that would allow an easy decomposition of the zones. For example, it would be very useful to select air conditioned zones out of a batch of honeybee zones (coming out of the solve adjacencies component for example).\n\n\n\nHope this seems useful to someone. Or it might be I need more efficient workflows.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 3:59am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Component request", "replies": [{"body": "\nSounds like a great idea!

I have only thought of the case of a conditioned/unconditioned component. I'll try and brainstorm some more but I know that I will probably come up with something else only through modeling.\n\n\n\nOne note would be, if it is possible of course, to be able to output the zones by name (if provided in the create zone component) and not as referenced breps? Please correct me if that is there somewhere. I am not sure this merits a component of its own, but it would greatly help selecting zones after the are separated by these components (since in complicated models I usually go around using an external simulation log and not the actualy geometry).\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 6:49pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nOk. \u00a0Conditioned/conditioned is on the to-do list:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/337](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/337)\n\nLet us know if you think if anything else.\n\nYou can use the Honeybee_Ask Me component to get all of the names of your zones. \u00a0Also, the Label Zones component can output the text strings of your zone names if you only want the names in one list. \u00a0I might be misunderstanding, though.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 7:53pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHuh, I did not see that component.

For the use case imagine if you want to change the glazing construction for all the walls facing west to be different. You can use this component to separate the zones, find the ones facing west and change their construction.\n\nVector list shows the vector direction of glazing/outdoor faces.

In writing my exercise tutorials for some workshops I'm hosting this weekend, one of the phd candidates who is trialing it for me has expressed his frustration that he needs to do these extra steps to figure out which zone is which after he has already named them. In the tutorial, I just have them splitting two zones to show how you can edit one zone separate to the other.\n\n\n\nCheers\n\nElly\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 25, 2016 at 7:39pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Elly,\n\nYou can use Honeybee_Label Zone component to plot all the zone names in the center of the zone.
