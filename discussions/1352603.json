I've found the following:\n\n1. The geometry is in the end of the universe. Very far from the origin. This is not a problem but when you want to zoom it is really annoying. So i baked and moved the rhino geometry close to the origin. Easy to manage. Of course it didn't solved the issue. Now we can go to point 2.\n\n2. I noticed the curved concave corners at the middle. My instinct said that maybe this can be a problem for HB. And it is!! I straightened those and now it is working. See attached.\n\nI'm not sure we can say this is a bug, but probably yes.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1353227", "name": "Butterfly_EW_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "September 1, 2015 at 11:54am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1352603"}
