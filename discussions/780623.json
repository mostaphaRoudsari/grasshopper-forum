{"body": "\nHi Tangminghao,\n\nre-ColorMesh gives you the chance to customize the presentation of the result (which is a mesh) before you bake it. It is most useful in cases that you are dealing with multiple studies and you want to have a\u00a0consistent\u00a0presentation (eg. normalize the legends).\u00a0It is also useful to customize the presentation for or a study that takes so long to re-run.\n\nYou can apply the similar changes using legendPar input in the component itself but then you have to re-run the study.\n\nI attached an example file that shows how you can normalize the legends, change the colors and add custom comments.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/TdIQzJmQRtyNfdChQVj2l7bvcsvIWqN2MFYWJDgNoKQO2kZfvTt*8ZgowuZDH49cwgeBRyZ6qsfB3TpliMn1ZuMVF-2dTs1i/Ladybug_recolor_Example.jpg?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/TdIQzJmQRtyNfdChQVj2l7bvcsvIWqN2MFYWJDgNoKQO2kZfvTt*8ZgowuZDH49cwgeBRyZ6qsfB3TpliMn1ZuMVF-2dTs1i/Ladybug_recolor_Example.jpg)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A780622", "name": "Ladybug_recolor_Mesh_Example.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 31, 2013 at 5:48pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "topic": "re-colorMesh", "replies": [{"body": "\nhey mostapha, when the amount of analysisresult and input mesh don't match, the re-colored mesh would have some problem\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Xinyi Wu", "created_at": "October 22, 2015 at 11:01am", "created_by": "XinyiWu", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nIf I just would like to change the legend bar\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Xinyi Wu", "created_at": "October 22, 2015 at 11:02am", "created_by": "XinyiWu", "replies": [{"body": "\nThis post is pretty old.
