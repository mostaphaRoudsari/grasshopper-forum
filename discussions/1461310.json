{"body": "\nHi all,\n\ni am trying to create a sunspace in front of a living room, as in the attached script (internalised geometries). I made it into two convex zones, one for the sunspace and one for the adjacent living room. The results i get show zero solar gains for the living room. I have deliberately oriented it towards south and i have designed large windows, so i think something is wrong regarding the direct solar component. Any advice would be most appreciated,\u00a0\n\nthank you!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1461009", "name": "Livingroomsunspace.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Iason Bournas", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 4:20pm", "created_by": "IasonBournas", "topic": "No solar gains through interior window", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Iason,\n\nYour file runs fine and if you look at surface results you will see the solar gain through the window is there (attached!):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/I56XjtvsDcMj9UIWytDA9Ur0E21c-7sW18HJ4XVGFp3CSb-U5f-d-z*02aXr-bVguksuzt-lvbaT-a0K75L0Uxp1DkX7Rg4z/solarGains.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/I56XjtvsDcMj9UIWytDA9Ur0E21c-7sW18HJ4XVGFp3CSb-U5f-d-z*02aXr-bVguksuzt-lvbaT-a0K75L0Uxp1DkX7Rg4z/solarGains.jpg)\n\nThe confusion happens since solarGain output on zone results is actually \"Zone Windows Total Transmitted Solar Radiation Energy\" output in EnergyPlus. If you check EnergyPlus InputOutputReference you can see the definition below:\n\nZone Windows Total Transmitted Solar Radiation Energy [J]<br/>The total Surface Window Transmitted Solar Radiation Rate of all the **exterior** windows in a\u00a0zone.\n\nSince your room has no exterior window the solar gain is 0. I think we should add this to output description.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1461069", "name": "Livingroomsunspace_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 5:09pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nYes this helps a lot!\n\nIt is as you say, \u00a0i checked with the heating energy too, and it is the one i should be getting.\n\nCase closed!\u00a0\n\nT h a n k \u00a0 y o u ! ! !\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iason Bournas", "created_at": "February 12, 2016 at 12:35am", "created_by": "IasonBournas", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1461310"}
