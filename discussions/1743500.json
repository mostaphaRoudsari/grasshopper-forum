{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and group members,\n\n\n\nThere are two questions about the Green roof issue as I ran the gh file named \"[Green Roof In Energy Mode](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Green_Roof_In_Energy_Model&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)l\" . I'll appreciate it if you give me a hand.\n\n\n\n**A.\u00a0Can\u2019t run correctly within Honeybee_Export To OpenStudio as opposite to the Honeybee_Run Energy Simulation. After I uploaded the Green roof construction setting into honeybee library, it still can't work.** The error said:\n\n1. Honeybee currently can't calculate U-Values for Material:RoofVegetation.\n\nYour Honeybee EnergyPlus simulations will still run fine with this material and this is only a Honeybee interface limitation..\n\nLet us know if you think HB should calcualte this material type and we will add it to the list. :)\n\n2. The material type Material:RoofVegetation hasn't been implemented yet!\n\n\u00a0Solution exception:openstudio::model::Material const &amp; type is null\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cSylPmWkJTP6pL46MaCnnKQPMmTm8A0hw84ulSPGtkX4InF0PCa0i8AqCSXnNpU2BnZws898w46-Muw*wBg3OUC5wU2B66Ln/Capture.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cSylPmWkJTP6pL46MaCnnKQPMmTm8A0hw84ulSPGtkX4InF0PCa0i8AqCSXnNpU2BnZws898w46-Muw*wBg3OUC5wU2B66Ln/Capture.PNG)\n\n**So how could I manage to calculate the influence by green roof in openstudio component as I also tend to calculate Light Control in openstudio component?\u00a0**\n\n\n\n**B. I used Honeybee_Decompose EP Construction to check the Green Roof construction's U-value_SI, it is -1.133198. Why it could be negative, what does it mean when u-value is negative?**\n\n**[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cSylPmWkJTNy6QMqXqtfMmXiPW09qVF4jrQKous77hCAwoFubPKcB9GwGJtyhtLPybLr72x9cEkDnp3KXlKBF9ewg8AZ3onb/uvalue.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cSylPmWkJTNy6QMqXqtfMmXiPW09qVF4jrQKous77hCAwoFubPKcB9GwGJtyhtLPybLr72x9cEkDnp3KXlKBF9ewg8AZ3onb/uvalue.PNG)**\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\u00a0\n\n\n\nXiaojian\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "May 1, 2017 at 8:27am", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "topic": "Green roof issue (u-value and material problems)", "replies": [{"body": "\nXiaojian,\n\nI have not yet implemented green roof materials in OpenStudio but I can add it in now. \u00a0I'll post back here when it's done.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 6, 2017 at 5:29am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nXiaojian,\n\nRoof vegetation now works with OpenStudio:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/commit/b4ecb375aaa54f3...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/commit/b4ecb375aaa54f34796001ebc046e20735c2f3ab)\n\nSee attached for an example file.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1746506", "name": "GreenRoof With Honeybee.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 6, 2017 at 6:13am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nChris,\n\n\n\nI checked the file you uploaded.
