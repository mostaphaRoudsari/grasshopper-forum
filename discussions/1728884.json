(My understanding is the \"read annual result I\" visualizes the Daylight Autonomy based on the advanced shading schedule but didn't generate another ill file?)\n\nI was doing it in Excel and found the difference between shading schedule and the sensor reading. Please let me know if I made any mistakes in the simulation setting! Any comments on a better data processing method would be much appreciated!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nXF\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "XF", "created_at": "April 6, 2017 at 6:37pm", "created_by": "XF", "topic": "Question about Annual Simulation with Advanced Dynamic Shading", "replies": [{"body": "\nTwo quick comments:\n\n1.

Since State 1 (curtain was pulled over at the corner) always exists unless the curtain is in State 2 (covering the glass), the illuminance value for State 1 is \u00a0min 0 lux, max 1 lux; the illuminance value for State 2 is min 9999 lux max 10000 lux.\n\n2. Please correct me if I were wrong, I set up a Thermal Control with 1 interior sensor, and I didn't set any lighting groups in the model. But to your point: I sometimes found lighting group control data in\u00a0intgain.csv although I didn't set anything. I thought only the manual control will trigger the Light Switch Model in Daysim?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\nBest,\n\nXF\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "XF", "created_at": "April 7, 2017 at 9:08am", "created_by": "XF", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n2.1.

Please let me know if I'm missing something here.\u00a0\n\nOver the weekend I tried different settings of min/max illuminance, and found something wrong with my setting:\n\nIdeally State 1 is only in use between 1-9999 lux and State 2 is only in use when it's above 10000 lux (on the sensor point). However in the component, the min illuminance is for the blind to open, and max illuminance is for the blind to close.\n\nIf I set State 1 (min 0 max 1), State 1 will be in use when it's above 1 lux; Then I set State 2 (min 9999 max 10000), State 2 will be in use when it's above 10000 lux; Then from the inter gain csv file, I found State 2 stays even after the illuminance dropped back to less than 9999 lux.\u00a0\n\nBased on the\u00a0[daysim example](http://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-shading-control-modes), State 2 should go back to State 1 when the sensor illuminance drops below the min illuminance set.
