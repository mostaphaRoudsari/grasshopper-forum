{"body": "\nHi,\n\nIs there any simple solution to set surface boundary conditions to have a constant temperature?\n\nI have my zone in question (an atrium) in-between two apartment zones that are assumed to have a constant temperature of say 21\u00b0C. Hence, I would prefer modelling only the atrium with BC's as a constant temperature rather than adiabatic.\n\nIf there is a way to give a whole zone a constant temperature, this would also be fine; I would then just model up these apartments on the side.\n\n\n\nTIA\n\n- Lasse\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lasse Hamborg", "created_at": "October 27, 2016 at 7:29am", "created_by": "LasseHamborg", "topic": "surface BC: constant temperature", "replies": [{"body": "\nHave you searched the forum?

That's not a favourable solution IMO.\n\nI'd like to simulate one single zone. 1 of the surfaces is connected to the ground; 2 of the surfaces should be set to a constant temperature of 21 deg (as these are apartments which I assume to have a constant temperature as these are not in focus).\n\nSo I'm looking for a fourth option to the EPBC_ input in 'createHBSrfs' that says 'constant temp.' or something similarly instead of just adiabatic, outdoors or ground; it's neither of those.\n\n- Lasse\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lasse Hamborg", "created_at": "November 4, 2016 at 3:50am", "created_by": "LasseHamborg", "replies": []}]}]}
