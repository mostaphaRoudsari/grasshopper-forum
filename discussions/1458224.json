In any case i updated it to last GH version. Probably the reason it wasn't working is becouse the hydra file used \"old\" components and your version installed is newer ... and probably (#2) you had other files opened ...\n\nIn any case the hydra file is not correct in its description and goal. The file is not giving you SVF (as you want) but VSC (vertical sky component). For more info on this see this [discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/sky-view-factor-vs-vertical-sky-component).\n\nFor SVF Chris re-wrote the LB_viewAnalysis component.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 8, 2016 at 12:04pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nAnd now the file ...\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1458314", "name": "Sky_View_in_an_Urban_Canyon_ZJ_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 8, 2016 at 12:04pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Abraham, thanks for your clarification!\n\n\n\nHowever, using the updated GH file, I still got the same error, and I'm not sure what is causing this ...\n\n\n\nAppreciate if you can kindly advise!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DMNc-KMuV*n4RJXnYxypKDCVG*SjNpV4tnhA1uJ0uzzFcNhy*2yvRp0CkibvvOqsYfGZtuPY0gT5kViAxWjBlk9Eop5q8mH8/0.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DMNc-KMuV*n4RJXnYxypKDCVG*SjNpV4tnhA1uJ0uzzFcNhy*2yvRp0CkibvvOqsYfGZtuPY0gT5kViAxWjBlk9Eop5q8mH8/0.PNG)I also tried the viewAnalysis component you suggested, and it seems that the sky view on unobstructed vertical surface is larger than 50% even if I increase the simulation resolution up to 4 (50.98%).

Try also changing it at your end and recalculating the GH.\n\nSaying that, then i started to test the HB_ViewAnalysis and found some bugs that i will report on the github. Increasing the resolution gives weird/crazy results (for instance, 100 on vertical surfaces).
