{"body": "\nHi Guys,\n\n\n\nFirst of all thank you so much for the fantastic tool!\n\n\n\nI am trying to test how artificial light is getting diffused by an external object.\n\nWhat would you recommend to do using Honeybee? Is there a way to set up an artificial light source and what sort of visualization should I look for?\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\n\nArthur\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Arthur Mamou-Mani", "created_at": "October 6, 2014 at 6:19pm", "created_by": "arthurmamoumani", "topic": "Electric Light Source with Honeybee and Radiance?", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Arthur, Thanks-\n\nFirst, let's not call it artificial light as it is a real light at the end of the day! I would call it electrical light. :)\n\nYou can use Honeybee IES2RAD component to insert the light into your scene and everything will be pretty standard Honeybee workflow from there.\n\nYou can either render the scene and/or measure the values for a grid based analysis.
