{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI found a small issue on the\u00a0Honeybee_Run daylight Simulation component. As you can see from the screenshot the done output return True even if the simulation didn't even started, but just for the fact that the Rad file (?) has been written and actually the result folder created. Is it something wanted? Because this create some problems when planning many simulations one after the other in a \"cascade\" style, where the following could start when the previous end using the True in the done output of the previous as input in the the runRad input of the following simulation. Thank you.\n\n\n\nbest\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Gk-Khs5Ug5Onz9obYwopwrTTjQ6fHdYIH4R70WjaNkZBB6evdjtoe8NxcBPFgmKKCG2jTfHjHtlwRR3qab9d8JrdnJtHT7XX/notdonebuttrue.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Gk-Khs5Ug5Onz9obYwopwrTTjQ6fHdYIH4R70WjaNkZBB6evdjtoe8NxcBPFgmKKCG2jTfHjHtlwRR3qab9d8JrdnJtHT7XX/notdonebuttrue.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "April 16, 2015 at 2:08am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "Small issue - Honeybee_Run daylight Simulation done output", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Francesco,\n\nI think your logic is right but at the same time writing the radiance file is a task which is done at some point. Isn't it? Can you tell me more about your case? In Grasshopper logic the components under shouldn't trigger if the component upstream hasn't finished the execution.\n\nAlso can connecting the same boolean toggle to both writeRad and runRad potentially solve the problem?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 16, 2015 at 4:15pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nwhat I had to do recently is a bunch of simulations (10) for a total of about 4 days. I wanted to run the first simulation and come back after the weekend (approx.) to find everything done. So I prepared all the building variations and I did input every configuration in one daylight simulation component.

So I used this \"switch\" to have a true output after the .ill files where written (and I delayed the true output of 1 miunte). So after 1 minue that every simulation was complete (.ill files written) the next was starting.

More than Pollination itself (like also you say) that is just a visualization and result reading tool, nevertheless very interesting but not the solution to simplify a process like the one I presented, what would be very useful is the script by David Rutten, Permutations. Actually I knew about but I totally forgot. Is it already implemented into GH? I don't think so. So where I can download it?

I have just one question: do the component work also with a boolean toggle? Or only with the click button? Because with the click button first you have to wait that the first simulation is completed then you can start the run all the iterations component. If this works also with the boolean toggle then with just one boolean toggle is possible to start everything (the daylight analysis component and the run all the iterations component) so it is not necessary to wait that the first simulation is completed.\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "May 4, 2015 at 1:30am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "replies": []}]}]}
