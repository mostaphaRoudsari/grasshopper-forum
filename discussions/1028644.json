{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nI started to study Honeybee for a work, thank you for the tool, I'm impressed.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1 - is it possible to consider shadings outside the windows in a Daylight analysis?\n\n2 - is it possible give a material (transparency) to the shadings? It could be different fabrics with different opacities.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "March 19, 2014 at 6:29am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "Shadings in Daylight analysis with Honeybee", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Francesco, Thanks!\n\n1. Yes. Just create the shadings. Use Honeybee_CreateHBSrfs to change it to a Honeybee object. I'm pretty sure that I'm doing something similar in\u00a0007_annualDaylightAnalysis_II_dynamicBlinds example.\n\n2. Yes. Just create the material and assign it to the shading materials. You can assign any king of RADIANCE materials to the shadings including transparent or translucent materials.\n\nHere is an example file:\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/WA*Dv5OWc2jsjx8gsoamEHNVA00FrEaxxTsVE9DedveOzK0TYmirt42lMaHUO-mBQhVilZp4S629hKFiM4e4RAGaO2HCvte1/Shading_For_Daylighting.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/WA*Dv5OWc2jsjx8gsoamEHNVA00FrEaxxTsVE9DedveOzK0TYmirt42lMaHUO-mBQhVilZp4S629hKFiM4e4RAGaO2HCvte1/Shading_For_Daylighting.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1028999", "name": "shadings_for_daylighting.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 19, 2014 at 8:36pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}], "id": "1028644"}
