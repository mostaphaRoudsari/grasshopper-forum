{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nFirst, I want to ask if anyone did a study or concept design for a BUS STOP in LBHB and you are welcome to share your study. THANKS.\u00a0\n\nIF not, can anyone help me to answer these problems:\n\n1. How do I do Thermal Analysis for the Roof? Should I calculate only Roof or the whole BUS STOP ? Should I apply material ?\n\n2. I have done the Shading Benefit Analysis.\u00a0\n\n3. By using the Outdoor Solar Temp and Outdoor Comfort Cal, I know the comfortableOrNot and percentOfTimeComfortable (WITHOUT roof or any cover). And how do I calculate WITH a roof to see if more people comfortable or not.\n\n.......\n\nHere is my GH file.\n\nIm really appreciate for your help.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/qZy0SSdaD2eAm0kAp2w141ohakeUMMZLR1pG1O-Jm01-nUgWUNLRR3VMGUilGWBgTBDfd950**bjN7inLHvBzz0PQTZdLR1r/BaTQuAI_Perspective.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/qZy0SSdaD2eAm0kAp2w141ohakeUMMZLR1pG1O-Jm01-nUgWUNLRR3VMGUilGWBgTBDfd950**bjN7inLHvBzz0PQTZdLR1r/BaTQuAI_Perspective.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1452832", "name": "BUS 2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Bao Nguyen", "created_at": "February 2, 2016 at 5:14am", "created_by": "BaoNguyen", "topic": "Case study: BUS STOP", "replies": [{"body": "\nCheck this:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Accounting_for_Solar_Radiation_in_Comfort&amp;slide=1&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,-0.2760977113503884)\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 2, 2016 at 5:25am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Abraham, I have checked this tutorial, and yes this is just a small part in my big problem. I understand the comparison of comfort SHADE &amp; SUN, and this is the result.
