{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI have imported an IDF and create new schedule based on occupancy and all the definition works.\n\nI would like to optimize the results using octopus but after 3 simulation the energy plus run component stops working (also after 3 simulations run manually). In attached you can find the figure with errors and the GH definition.\n\nSomeone can you help me?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\u00a0\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nAndrea\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1549070", "name": "Foto 16-06-16, 19 44 52.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1549071", "name": "testimport3_az.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Andrea Zani", "created_at": "June 16, 2016 at 12:11pm", "created_by": "AndreaZani905", "topic": "Fatal Error in Energy Simulation", "replies": [{"body": "\nI'm sorry i have forgotten the idf file.\n\nIn attached you can find the idf.\n\n\n\nThanks again.\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nAndrea\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1549672", "name": "modulo-sh-control2.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Andrea Zani", "created_at": "June 17, 2016 at 10:03am", "created_by": "AndreaZani905", "replies": []}], "id": "1549072"}
