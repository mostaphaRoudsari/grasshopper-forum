{"body": "\nFirst of all, the work you are doing is fantastic.\n\n\n\nI'm trying to get some geometry to work in the grid-base analysis example file. It seems that the only geometry that will be accepted are surfaces that can be joined into a solid. Is this by design?\n\nWhen ever a set of surfaces can't be combined into a solid, it fails to produce results. I have a complex building lighting situation, where the daylight strategy relies on a central atrium to achieve lighting levels. I'm struggling to get the geometry to be properly converted into Honeybee geometry. Anybody have any suggestions?\n\nMy larger objective is to do some preliminary daylight analysis to see where a project stands on LEED IEQ 8.1. Is the grid based analysis example script the best place to start in building a script for this? As you can tell, I'm using the grid based analysis to get a daylight factor for a space that has been previously modelled, rather than parametrically defined. I'm also more interested in Lux readings than daylight factor, but this seems to be an easy modification.\n\nI know there are multiple questions here, but the main question is about the Honeybee object, and why the analysis fails when they aren't solids.\n\n\n\nThanks.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1132408", "name": "daylight modeling.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "will krzymowski", "created_at": "September 16, 2014 at 3:34pm", "created_by": "willkrzymowski", "topic": "Grid Based Analysis - Honeybee Object Question", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Will, Thanks-\n\nFor daylighting you don't need to have a closed brep/solid.\n\nYes. You should use grid-based analysis and you can get the illuminance values by setting the type of the analysis to illuminance.

I am trying to understand how to use this type of definition to determine percentage of occupied space filled with a certain level of FC daylight.\n\nI would like to calculate the percent of space filled with a certain level of light. I dispatch the illuminance values and divide them by the total number of values. I believe this is correct? however I would like to display the area that has the level of exposure and am not sure how to do that. Is there a good way to do this?\n\nAlso when I set the bounds off the legend parameters to the actual bounds of the illuminance values I get a very limited display of light. I want to be sure I am displaying the correct colors ... can you advise?
