{"body": "\nHi all, i'm trying to check the diference of\u00a0illuminance between a passive and active user for some variations of building elements: window size, shade type and size, orientation of building and numbers of shades. For that i used static blinds for simulate the passive user and the dynamic blinds with Honeybee_Advanced Dynamic Shading Recipe for active users. To see the results i'm using\u00a0 Honeybee_Read Annual Result II to see the results between the custom range of 500 to 5000 lux, i could do all the variations of elements that i wanted for the passive user, but when i started using the Honeybee_Advanced Dynamic Shading Recipe i keep getting a error with Honeybee_Read Annual Result II and cant get any result. It works fine with Honeybee_Read Annual Result I, but i can't change it to show me the range 500 to 5000lux. There's a way i can see this result? Also, i used the excel to calculate the UDI for the static blinds, there's a way to calculate that for the dynamic blinds?\n\n\n\nThank you all!!!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1709933", "name": "mandar para o forum.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Allyson Carvalho Silva Santos", "created_at": "March 11, 2017 at 7:44am", "created_by": "AllysonCarvalhoSilvaSantos", "topic": "Problem with Read Annual Daylight Results II", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Allyson,\n\nHoneybee_Read Annual Result II is not designed to deal with dynamic blinds and schedule.

You can use the shading profile from the generated .csv file to find the shading state for each hour and then use that to merge 3 .ill files into one based on shading states.

Does shade control type also affects the shadding state for annual Daylight Simulation, or just for energy simulation?
