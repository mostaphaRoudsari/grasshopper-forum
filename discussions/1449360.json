{"body": "\nHi All!\n\n\n\nFirstly, YAY I'm glad this component has arrived! Removes the annoying spagehti mess of the native components.\n\n\n\nHowever, I am curious as to why it has been coded to extrude the windows INSIDE the model. Typically these are extruded outside. The reason why I ask is because in daylighting analysis, these extrusions cause some shading under them which is not accurate.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/G6D6VGDF3GtQEk*KpYVi4QdgZOG6BnEhonD-S53TDoUOkFNgyYIH-10jeHAB*XBjtNVxIq2u4VQ-l7Ga0YYC6Dr5YIywHRVm/Extrusionsontheinside.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/G6D6VGDF3GtQEk*KpYVi4QdgZOG6BnEhonD-S53TDoUOkFNgyYIH-10jeHAB*XBjtNVxIq2u4VQ-l7Ga0YYC6Dr5YIywHRVm/Extrusionsontheinside.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 28, 2016 at 3:30pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Window Extrusion Component making the extrusions on the inside", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Elzine,\n\n\n\nI think the surface normals for your glazings might be facing inwards. If I remember correctly, the code looks for the direction of the surface normals and then creates extrusions in that direction. This error will (hopefully) be resolved if you flip your glazing surfaces.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "January 28, 2016 at 7:20pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}]}
