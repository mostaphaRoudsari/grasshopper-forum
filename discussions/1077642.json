{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI have set illuminance levels for my blinds state (100-2000 lux) of my two SH groups. When the analysis is done and sensor points have been defined I check the annual shading profile. Results say that the shading systems are open for all the year.\n\nI tried to do the annual study with the conceptual shading component and it works quite better giving me back an acceptable result.\n\nAnyway I see that the electrical lighting power consumption is oddly low.\n\nWhat mistake I'm not seeing?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nClaudio\n\nIf it can be useful *.ill files etc are here:\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13141514/annual_study.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13141514/annual_study.zip)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1077641", "name": "hall_annual_study_00.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "May 24, 2014 at 4:57pm", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "topic": "Daysim shading setting in annual study", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Claudio. I'm traveling right now and cannot check your file, but couple of questions that might help.\n\n\n\n1. In case of dynamic blinds where do you put your sensors? There is a component that let you check the annual results for a single point during the year. You can use that to see if the sensor point ever reaches the threshold.\n\n\n\n2. What is the number that you defined for LP? Daysim does a simple multiplication between hours, lighting power, etc.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 26, 2014 at 6:34am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha.\n\n1. I tried to apply that component you said. Actually it doesn't work saing 'Solution exception:KeyError' I have provivded my test points as a tree with 6 branches (n items) and sensors as a another tree with 6 branches (1 item).
