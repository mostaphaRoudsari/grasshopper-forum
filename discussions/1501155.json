{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\nI know you are super busy right now rewriting and improving the code. If it is possible (and maybe a good time to?) I'd like to ask for adding a functional transparency to PNGs (without color loss or baking). Once again quite often instead of pasting a diagram, I have to clean up white background from the image (which is not hard but leaves some artefacts).\n\nAnyway, I brought this issue up before and if it is something useful for others too, it would be mega awesome to see this feature in the next release.\n\nWhat do you think? What people think, is it just me?\n\nHave a nice day.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "April 5, 2016 at 1:19am", "created_by": "Timur582", "topic": "Wish: Add transparency to Capture View component", "replies": [{"body": "\nTim,\n\nThis has also been a hassle in my workflows. \u00a0It I had to deal with PowerPoint's artifact-ridden \"set transparent color\" method again, I was going to flip. \u00a0Thankfully, it was easy to implement on the component:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4-r35uyukEYW291gGyT7Ox-ULoz0*bOXmom26iTPkaI6iKbNTi3HZgU4uIzNbjIwQcobL-1BNp6CfOt8m2F81HP7OYEAYOBF/TransparBack.JPG\" width=\"583\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4-r35uyukEYW291gGyT7Ox-ULoz0*bOXmom26iTPkaI6iKbNTi3HZgU4uIzNbjIwQcobL-1BNp6CfOt8m2F81HP7OYEAYOBF/TransparBack.JPG)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1505997", "name": "TransparentBackground.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 11, 2016 at 12:24pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI love you man.

Before that I only learnt Visual Basic in chinese XD as one of compulsory courses after which I had enough XD.
