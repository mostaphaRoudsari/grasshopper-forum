{"body": "\nHi folks,\n\n\n\nLast month Honeybee got [PV panels simulation](https://app.box.com/s/70ztpo8xk31zuvxi7qbzcoqd2buioptv) components based on EnergyPlus.\n\nOur Ladybug and Honeybee pets love to work together. As a result of this, we are releasing PV simulation components for Ladybug too. They are based on [PVWatts v1](http://pvwatts.nrel.gov) online calculator, supporting crystalline silicon fixed tilt photovoltaics.\n\nYou can download them [from here](https://app.box.com/s/wu2hkxiav2bujb06fwa42pyattikesg9), or use the\u00a0[Update Ladbybug](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/video/sync-old-grasshopper-files-with-github-source-code) component instead. If you take the first option, after downloading check if .ghuser files are blocked (right click -&gt; \"Properties\" and select \"Unblock\").\n\nYou can download the [example files from here](https://app.box.com/s/xfn2h6m62db6p342gnt6u0u3flr3l7j5).\n\nVideo tutorials will follow in the coming period.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the very essence these components help you answer the question: \"How much energy can my roof, building facade, solar parking... generate if I would populate them with PV panels\"?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Z3BWMoplk5QKlFCx*BoLz-3t09XwpRA7kbZgiMRkXLXawnKoCZ2XCkKVyyF5cLbBm*kVV8WeHHFLiBU4zSyXvbhcP-wc*tCw/photovoltaics_usage.jpg?width=400\" width=\"400\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Z3BWMoplk5QKlFCx*BoLz-3t09XwpRA7kbZgiMRkXLXawnKoCZ2XCkKVyyF5cLbBm*kVV8WeHHFLiBU4zSyXvbhcP-wc*tCw/photovoltaics_usage.jpg)\n\n\n\nThey allow definition of different types of losses (snow, age, shading...) which may affect your PV system:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Z3BWMoplk5SKli5hVB7-9WdIvC1qAnTs4LdiOxOoi5lYNsNMY6Pziuk0mXUcOCMa*Ledz0Sb4XY6n3BjseCTWQTz60LAe0UZ/photovoltaics_shading.jpg?width=400\" width=\"400\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Z3BWMoplk5SKli5hVB7-9WdIvC1qAnTs4LdiOxOoi5lYNsNMY6Pziuk0mXUcOCMa*Ledz0Sb4XY6n3BjseCTWQTz60LAe0UZ/photovoltaics_shading.jpg)\n\n\n\nAnd can find its optimal tilt and orientation:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Z3BWMoplk5TtG*28T73YiS1aOkyNX37y18aXMerSsbHeeqg*3za9E2wQFEdlrcf4cLj0fxuW1diHeM2sae2lmbn*hsKa*-oe/photovoltaics_optimal.jpg?width=400\" width=\"400\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Z3BWMoplk5TtG*28T73YiS1aOkyNX37y18aXMerSsbHeeqg*3za9E2wQFEdlrcf4cLj0fxuW1diHeM2sae2lmbn*hsKa*-oe/photovoltaics_optimal.jpg)\n\n\n\nOr analyse its performance, energy value, consumption, emissions...\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/EMVKhgUIcMtH2jSZ1vdremCuQbf1TGTQNm8HDss9phdYnUlLlqobNwRsheyKGtCsXwRjYnM7dPD59PW3tbttskyrF7vHQORy/photovoltaics_performance.png?width=400\" width=\"400\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/EMVKhgUIcMtH2jSZ1vdremCuQbf1TGTQNm8HDss9phdYnUlLlqobNwRsheyKGtCsXwRjYnM7dPD59PW3tbttskyrF7vHQORy/photovoltaics_performance.png)\n\n\n\nBy Djordje Spasic and Jason Sensibaugh, with invaluable support of Dr. Frank Vignola, Dr. Jason M.

Works like a charm and gives all results. However, I have 11 different surfaces as my pv system that I am inputting to the components. The results come out one for each of the surfaces, along with a big number of sunpath shading graphs (I imagine for each). Is there a way to sum these up? I mean I can, and I am, manipulate the data structures when it comes to results. However, I was wondering if we can get a cumulative sunpath shading. Now that I think about it that wouldn't make much sense. Would it be possible to get different (coloured?) patches on a sunpath shading for each surface?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "July 22, 2015 at 1:33am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Theodoros,\n\nWould you be so kind to\u00a0[open a new topic](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topic/new?target=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grasshopper3d.com%2Fgroup%2Fladybug) on this issue?<br/>And attaching your .gh file would make it much more easier to give a reply.<br/>Thank you in advance.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 22, 2015 at 4:40am", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nyeah.. same problem here.\u00a0\n\nMultiple surfaces = multiple\u00a0sunpath shading would be great if this could be summed to one mesh\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Atis Sedlenieks", "created_at": "July 22, 2015 at 5:29am", "created_by": "AtisSedlenieks", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nOne more vote on that from me!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "July 22, 2015 at 12:27pm", "created_by": "doompop", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nGuau!!! great job, Djordje!!! :) I've tried your components recently and they are awesome!!!\u00a0<br/><br/>Just in case someone else have the problem that I found (and it took me many hours to realize...) : the PV surface should be oriented with the normal vector to the sun direction (it's SO obvious but I was founding an error and didn't know it was that stupid detail ;))\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Eli Li Li", "created_at": "November 6, 2015 at 12:01am", "created_by": "EliLiLi", "replies": []}], "id": "1309523"}
