It's usually a warning for when the direction of glazing surface is not the same as the parent surface. How are you generating the glazing surfaces? A quick way to check which surfaces are causing this issue is to import the idf file into OpenStudio and that will give you a report.\n\n\n\nThe second error is because you have non-convex surfaces in your model. As far as I can see it's not major in your case but you can always split non-convex faces into convex faces by splitting them into convex surfaces.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 4, 2016 at 6:57am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHey Mostapha,\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you for the fast reply.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe windows were generated using Rhino geometry imported from Sketchup, but I also tried using the glazing based on ratio component, which resulted in the same error.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI fixed the\u00a0non-convex surfaces in the model, which in turn fixed the window error.

In that case the simulation is fine. The reason that you see the surfaces on top of each other is that Rhino fails to subtract the window from the base surface and you see two co-planar surfaces in view which is what Tim mentioned. This doesn't change the results for energy simulation as EnergyPlus takes the full surfaces for wall and window.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 4:23pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHey Mostapha,\u00a0\n\n\n\nYes the attached pciture show the\u00a0visualization of the idf file.
