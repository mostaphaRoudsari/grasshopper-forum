{"body": "\nHi!<br/><br/>I just started playing around with Ladybug (great by the way) but I am still trying to get the hang of the whole thing. Is it possible you could upload a sample sunpath file to fully understand all the components.<br/><br/>I am wondering if there is any way of scaling the sunpath itself before baking. I am also having triuble customizing the color output. <br/><br/>I would greatly appreciate any info you can give us on this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBest!<br/>Andres\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andres Oyaga Loewy", "created_at": "February 27, 2013 at 9:48am", "created_by": "AndresOyagaLoewy", "topic": "SUNPATH?", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Andres,\n\nAbsolutely!

The shadow studies should be there... I have been thinking about it and there are possibilities to use the Rhino sun function to run the study on Rhino objects but it doesn't work for Grasshopper\u00a0geometries\u00a0([read more here](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/8)). I also tried Mesh/Mesh Intersection approach ([similar to this](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/sun-shadow-question?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A320346)), the result wasn't promissing at all. Not sure if there is any solid approach that I should try.\n\nThe possibility for now is to use sunlight-hours study component with sun-path and change the colors of the result. It will be slow but it will work. I will cover this is the in the tutorial.\n\n-Mostapha\n\nPS:\u00a0Can you please tell me more about your issue with customizing the colors?
