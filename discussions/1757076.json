Both\u00a0[CIE 157:2004](http://www.cie.co.at/index.php?i_ca_id=433) and\u00a0[LG8:2015](http://www.cibse.org/Knowledge/knowledge-items/detail?id=a0q20000008I7kIAAS) (which appears to defer to CIE 157:2004) mention limiting illuminance and limiting exposure (lux hours). Hours with direct solar irradiance are likely to exceed the limiting illuminance thresholds, which range from (200 to 50 lux as per Table 3.4 in CIE 157:2004). It makes sense to consider direct illuminance (an ab=0 simulation in Honeybee)\u00a0 separately from a normal illuminance calculation.\n\n\n\nAssuming that the museum exhibits have low to high responsivity to light, an ideal solution would minimize direct sunlight. For daylight from the sky and reflected light, it might be enough to keep the illuminance levels below the recommended thresholds and then sum up lux-hours.\n\n\n\nDaysim, the annual daylighting engine used by Honeybee and DIVA, is not very accurate for direct-sun calculations. You will get more accurate results if you run your analysis with Radiance directly.\n\n\n\nInstead of considering the horizontal illuminance grids, one can create grids that correspond to the dimensions of the exhibit and then average those values. I think single points, as shown in your gh file might not suffice. Calculating lux-hours is by far the simplest part of such a simulation. It will only require averaging these points, extracting them into an array and then summing up that array.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 24, 2017 at 5:29pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you for the detailed response, Sarith!\n\n\n\nCould you elaborate on why Daysim is not accurate for direct illuminance analysis?

The [DDS version of Daysim](https://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2009-boston-ma/Presentations/Radiance%20WS2009_DaysimInnovations_CReinhart.pdf) is more accurate but that is not implemented in Honeybee. Pure Radiance calcs for the entire year will probably take over 10 days to run for the entire year (which is why use Daysim in the first place!).\n\n\n\nWith regards to your questions about solar exposure, and lux-hours, Yes, that is what I meant. Within the context of Daylighting simulations, it is almost useless to consider UV modeling.\u00a0 Radiance is a three channel ray-tracing engine, where each channel corresponds to a certain [cone sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell). Daysim is a simplification of Radiance, which only considers the [photopic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_function). I am not sure if it would be possible to get the spectral reflectance distributions and spectral transmittance distributions of all the involved surfaces to get a proper idea of UV incident on a particular surface\n\n\n\nI recommend referring CIE 157:2004 for more info on this ([IES has an RP document on this topic](https://www.ies.org/store/recommended-practices-and-ansi-standards/recommended-practice-for-museum-lighting/), but since I haven't referred it before, I can't vouch for it).\u00a0\n\n\n\nAbout the array stuff, I was referring to the data structures in the python scheme of things. Assuming that you have a rectangular frame that you'd like to count lux hours for, it makes sense to average the illuminance on it at any given time. The sum of average illuminances for every hour will result in lux hours.\u00a0 The CIE document uses a similar logic for calculating threshold lux hours. For example, a threshold illuminance of 50 lux for 3000 hours will result in lux-hours of 150000, which will result in noticeable fading in high responsivity materials.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 25, 2017 at 5:22pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nOn a slightly separate note:\n\nI believe the GH file I posted produces annual lux-hour values and it allows you to visualize results with colored grids.
