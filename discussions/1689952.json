You can for instance lower the insulation thickness in order to lower the overall U-value of the wall.\n\n\n\nIf you really want to model a door, then I think a good way would be\n\n1- Create your geometry (including the door)\n\n2- Create HB surfaces with their properties\n\n3- Create your zone\n\n\n\nI am not sure this is possible, but maybe you can also add a opaque window to the wall ?\u00a0<br/><br/>Aurelien\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aurelien Keller", "created_at": "February 12, 2017 at 12:19pm", "created_by": "AurelienKeller", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Aurelien Keller,\n\n\n\nThank you very much, i will try to create module according to your solution.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSolon.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Solon", "created_at": "February 12, 2017 at 5:21pm", "created_by": "w9002", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHi Aurelien Keller,\n\n\n\nI tried to create window and door on a wall(surface), but I do not get successful.\n\n\n\nCould you please help me,\u00a0I would\u00a0appreciate\u00a0it\u00a0if\u00a0you send a sample to me.\n\n\n\nP.S.: Please use commend of Grasshopper only.

However, I feel like it would be great to know the uncertainties associated with every simplification in an energy model, including this one.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of different ways to take their effect into account.\n\nTo account for leakages, you can for instance add inter-zone mixing flow rates in E+ that would account for mixing air between adjacent zones and zones to outdoor.\n\nIf you need a greater level of detail, you should integrate an aeraulic model and a thermal model using CONTAM or COMIS for instance. (I know there are some ways to make them work with E+, but never used them this way)\n\n\n\nAurelien\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aurelien Keller", "created_at": "June 26, 2017 at 2:01am", "created_by": "AurelienKeller", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nJust seeing this, Thank you for your thoughts.
