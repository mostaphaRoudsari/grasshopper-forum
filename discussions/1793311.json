{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\n\nI keep experiencing a problem that disappears after I turn off multiple CPU\u00b4s. A DF calculation with simple geometry. It seems as if the analysis points that get routed to the different cores somehow acquire different settings/are calculated differently. Appears at random \u201crows\u201d of points, sometimes it all works fine, so I need to do a series for the error to show. See images below.\n\nIn the Ladybug fly run the VT of the window changes.\n\nIt\u2019s taken me a day and a half to track this error down. Phew.\n\nI get the same error on two different comps.\n\nWhat is causing this? Does anyone get the same error? Images below created with \u00a0RADquality set to 2, and 7 cores. Fiddling with Radsettings dont help, I think, except error goes away with very low ab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/r-deMYADSbo3pFRVSl4dmYPtbTfv9TTz3x4p9rGfF9Qm8qNDWoq6IhRhaI2hOspcBUKvYUZEdhmjnhlOnlG3CQtCzkuVwpY6/stortransmittans0.45q2gsize2.0_Topstor.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/r-deMYADSbo3pFRVSl4dmYPtbTfv9TTz3x4p9rGfF9Qm8qNDWoq6IhRhaI2hOspcBUKvYUZEdhmjnhlOnlG3CQtCzkuVwpY6/stortransmittans0.45q2gsize2.0_Topstor.png)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/r-deMYADSbrHIqPu9jlChmzEAYfq6lxxKzI9Tx9BIKUrRjnXCp*13XnU-vq5lppXIEav6NMkz14TyabiVXNz-UDhrpHEpGS8/stortransmittans0.55q2gsize2.0_Topstor.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/r-deMYADSbrHIqPu9jlChmzEAYfq6lxxKzI9Tx9BIKUrRjnXCp*13XnU-vq5lppXIEav6NMkz14TyabiVXNz-UDhrpHEpGS8/stortransmittans0.55q2gsize2.0_Topstor.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Qhk3-LcC9fheDZvJ2ZpIZsy2oW7bc7z2AGUZekqdAM3encGStranJasc*EwlAHmcBSiaOt4WT8jiFRL8TczbA5ACQ5D2eIVI/stortransmittans0.50q2gsize2.0_Topstor.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Qhk3-LcC9fheDZvJ2ZpIZsy2oW7bc7z2AGUZekqdAM3encGStranJasc*EwlAHmcBSiaOt4WT8jiFRL8TczbA5ACQ5D2eIVI/stortransmittans0.50q2gsize2.0_Topstor.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1793310", "name": "Stripes forum question.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "August 3, 2017 at 3:44am", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "topic": "Multiple CPU causing errors (Radiance)", "replies": [{"body": "\nOoh, I forgot to internalize geometry.
