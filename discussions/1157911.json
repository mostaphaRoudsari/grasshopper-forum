{"body": "\nHi everyone,\u00a0\n\nI am trying to show the VSC (vertical sky component) over the facade of a building but turns out the output I get is 14 times bigger that the number of points in my grid, and therefore the \"Ladybug re-color mesh\" component fails to work. Does anyone know why is are the results larger than my grid and how could I make it work?\u00a0\n\nThanks!\n\nAlejandro[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/n9CkP9pTfMNWeHrrIfaOu-iu1evQdisRLs65*Apqz-gXcDPmx9DW1CcS9nLkAdKQrsbJVOMpCkbGeV4wmJgTV5i-fLsB03Z6/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/n9CkP9pTfMNWeHrrIfaOu-iu1evQdisRLs65*Apqz-gXcDPmx9DW1CcS9nLkAdKQrsbJVOMpCkbGeV4wmJgTV5i-fLsB03Z6/Capture.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "October 29, 2014 at 8:22am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Showing VSC over a grid", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Alejandro,\n\n\n\nCan you please attach the file here? It is really hard to say why it is happening by just looking to screen capture.\n\n\n\nAlso why are you connecting the output of Honeybee_Honeybee to runDaylighting component?\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 1, 2014 at 10:03pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\u00a0\n\nHere is the file.
