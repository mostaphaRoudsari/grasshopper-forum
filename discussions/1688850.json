{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI am trying to monitor and save summer radiation mesh, winter radiation mesh, parameters and the shading geometry seperately. Capture view component is really handy when i save the images manually. However, when I coupled those with the fly component, in order to automitize the process and further make a brute force search, view 2 doesn't capture any geometry. This may be due to the custom preview components that I used.\n\n\n\nI am attaching screenshots from the related parts of the definition.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nMustafa\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1688847", "name": "Screenshot - 10_02.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1688848", "name": "Screenshot - 10_02 002.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1688849", "name": "Screenshot - 10_02 003.png"}], "created_by_name": "Mustafa Teksoy", "created_at": "February 10, 2017 at 1:15am", "created_by": "MustafaTeksoy", "topic": "Capture View doesn't work with custom previews when the fly component is run", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mustafa,\n\nI created capturing view with the same as your screenshots, it works for me for all views.\n\n\n\nPlease find attached.\n\nregards,\n\nOmid.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1689117", "name": "View_capturing_OMD.rar"}], "created_by_name": "Omid Rashidi", "created_at": "February 10, 2017 at 6:32am", "created_by": "OmidmRashidi", "replies": [{"body": "\nAlso, you can set the different path for each view.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Omid Rashidi", "created_at": "February 10, 2017 at 6:55am", "created_by": "OmidmRashidi", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Omid,\u00a0\n\nThank you for your reply.
