The use of dielectric materials leads to an increase in simulation time.It is one of the reasons why Radiance has a glass material which is optimized for thin surfaces. For most daylighting calculations it rarely makes computational sense to model dielectric materials. For example, Glazings almost always should be modeled with the glass material.\n\nThere are several applications, however, where you need to use dielectrics. For example, to model water or a glass bricks.
