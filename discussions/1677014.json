{"body": "\n\n\nThis post is about 10 days overdue, but as they say, better late than never! Also this is two posts in one post. If you're not interested in the news about the new releases scroll down to the end of the post.\n\n\n\n10 days ago was the 4th anniversary of the release of the first version of Ladybug and as the title says, I wanted to share with you what 2017 entails for Ladybug Analysis Tools (previously known as Ladybug + Honeybee).\n\n\n\nIn December 20016 at the AEC Tech Hackathon, I gave a presentation which pretty much covers all I need to write here. I\u2019m copying the links to the videos so you can watch them and I will just highlight the most important topics. [Here are the slides that I used for this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v07eP_xtsZfRltynQH_aSLpxynjIEBigOiVYmkojSCc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0Zd2SyuLpU?wmode=opaque\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZXp1sJaIzk?wmode=opaque\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n\nThe first major release of 2017 is a new version of the original Ladybug + Honeybee plugins, which will hereafter be referred to as the legacy version of Ladybug Analysis Tools. Now that the plugins have been fully connected to the major open source engines and databases, the majority of changes represent \u201cicing on the cake.\u201d There are a number of new components related to maximizing the visual capabilities of Rhino, including contour map visualizations, components to make rendered animations, texture mapping components for transparent meshes (and connections to VR programs), and stereographic sky projections. Furthermore, the last of the thermal comfort models for local discomfort (drafts and radiant asymmetry) have been incorporated along with components that help calculate discomfort from given geometric and thermal criteria (a simplified downdraft model and a view factor component). There have been a few extensions of OpenStudio/E+ capabilities to get out HVAC system sizing results and to request/search through the hundreds of outputs that E+ offers. Finally, there are a few workflow improvements, including changes to use less memory when building large energy models and a workflow to import HBZones from gbXML. Chris has been leading the development for the legacy version during the last year or so and he deserves all the credits. There is no way to thank him enough for what he does on a daily basis. I can only say that we are all so lucky to have him around!\n\n\n\nAfter the release of the legacy plugin, the next major release of 2017 will be the public release of Butterfly, which is already long overdue. If you are watching the project on GitHub, you should already know that we are very close and are trying to make the final improvements before the release. The release will have its own separate release notes. For now, I want to thank Theodore Galanos and everyone who helped us with their suggestions during the development process. There would be no Butterfly if it wasn\u2019t for Theodore.\n\n\n\nButterfly\u2019s release will be followed by the release of Honeybee[+]. The first release of Honeybee[+] supports most of the functionalities in the current version of Honeybee for daylight simulation plus it addresses many of the current limitations for annual daylight modeling by using Radiance 3-phase method. It should also support Grasshopper both on Windows and Mac as well as Dynamo. There is much more about Honeybee[+] which again will be included in a separate post. I want to thank Sarith Subramaniam and everyone who helped us with testing the code during the development. Honeybee[+] won\u2019t have most of its features if it wasn\u2019t for Sarith.\n\n\n\nI also want to thank everyone on the forum who helps other users with questions and solutions. That\u2019s how I and the rest of the developers get the time to focus on the new developments. Yet I didn\u2019t get a chance to update the graph for this year but you know who you are. Thank you!\n\n\n\nFinally, I am posting a modified draft from last year February. Chris and I drafted this post last year but never posted it as I was waiting for the \u201cright time\u201d to post it. The \u201cright time\u201d would be when we have free time to answer all the questions but that time seems not to come! We will do our best to reply to your comments as much as we can. Here is that post:\n\n----\n\nEven though we receive comments and ideas from many of you on a daily basis\u00a0[Tim's recent comment](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/xn/detail/2985220:Comment:1463246) [it was recent at the time!] made me think that we should, once more, explicitly ask for your comments while developing the new version of Ladybug (and at some point Honeybee), and also collect the ongoing ones in a single place.\n\n\n\nSo post your comments, suggestions and wishes here and let us know what can we do to make Ladybug and Honeybee better. Any type of comments are welcome as far as you tell us why you think it is important. Here are a couple of questions to get you started:\n\n\n\n- What is currently missing? Why do you think that missing feature is important?\n\n- If you could only change one thing, what would it be and why?\n\n- What do you like the most about Ladybug + Honeybee that you don't want to change in the new release?\n\n- What kind of bottlenecks do you run into? - What have you done with Ladybug + Honeybee that you think it should/could have been done much simpler if we could have made a couple of changes?\n\n- What do you think will be essential/missing from Ladybug for Dynamo?\n\n- ...\n\n\n\nYour turn! Let us know your thoughts!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 23, 2017 at 9:09am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "topic": "Ladybug Analysis Tools in 2017!", "replies": [{"body": "\nFirst off: thanks for all you great work.

I remember your discussion about this. The main issue for showing the progress is to know how much of the progress is already done. [For radiance ray-tracing there is no easy way to do that](http://www.radiance-online.org:82/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010399.html). EnergyPlus and Rpict (Image-based) daylighting already generate some sort of reports. I assume your main request is for annual daylight analysis? In that case moving away from Daysim might actually help to find a solution. Sarith and I discussed the option to check the file size but haven't really tried it. I added a new issue to the new honeybee repository.

GSHP system templates) will be implemented as Measures and shared through the OpenStudio BCL.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 28, 2017 at 1:24pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nExciting post and news Mostapha!!!\n\nThank you\u00a0 ... and Happy 4th Birthday.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 23, 2017 at 11:35am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you sir and thank you for supporting us during the last 4 years!

He has done a great job rewriting most of them but there is still a lot to be fixed. At the same time, as they say, people are blind to their own mistakes. We need the input from you or other users to get them fixed. If you can provide us a list of the descriptions that you think can be improved we will make sure to get them fixed in the next release.\n\nGenerally speaking we need better documentation but we have right now what is available is the [primers](https://www.gitbook.com/@mostapharoudsari). That should be a good place to start.\n\nI think both of this comments takes an effort from the community more than the developers. We can definitely help to get it started like the primers but then making it perfect takes a group of people.\n\n\n\nFor the rest of your questions see my replies between the lines\n\n\n\n- It might be a WIP, but a tool to add/change some parameters could be nice.

Then it should be possible and I would open an issue for this on GitHub.\n\n\n\ncomponent to add surface properties to shading/context geometries.\n\nEnergyPlus has limitations for how much you can set the properties for shading objects but there is room for improvement in this case. See [this discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/energy-simulation-taking-into-account-albedo-of-urban-context-1?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1526511&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987).\n\n\n\nif possible: get the losses trough the envelope of the building to add to the energy balance.\n\nThis is already there you can get the conduction both for transparent and opaque surfaces.
