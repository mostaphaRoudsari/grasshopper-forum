{"body": "\nI have an apartment building that I am trying to model and I need to allow for each bathroom and kitchen extract that is present in each apartment.

Would you be able to give me an example of the additional string text that I would use to simulate bathroom extracts of 25l/s for each bathroom in the apartments for one hr per day (each apartment has 2 bathrooms) and kitchen extracts of 50l/s for one hour per day.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nChelle\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chelle Payne", "created_at": "March 28, 2016 at 7:31pm", "created_by": "ChellePayne", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nChelle,\n\nThere's a small correction that should be made to Mostapha's comment. \u00a0We do have the ability to model fans but it is a simple implementation that will require you to answer the question of where fresh outdoor air is being pulled in by this fan. \u00a0If fresh air is just being pulled in from a window or outdoor grille in the bathroom zone, you can use the NatVent component to easily model this fan. \u00a0Part 3 of this example file shows you how to set up such a fan:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Natural_Ventilation&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\nIf fresh air is being pulled from neighboring zones, then you have to set up a series of mixing objects between zones if you want to be super-accurate and this can get a bit messy. \u00a0In this case, I might just account for the extra heating/cooling energy from the bathroom fan by increasing the ventilationPerArea of the source zone using the \"Set EnergyPlus Zone Loads\" component. \u00a0Overall, I imagine that such fans are not going to greatly impact your energy use unless they are always on or on for all occupied hours.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 30, 2016 at 10:17pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThank you for replying. I feel a bit like royalty has replied as I've watched everyone of your youtube videos. Many more than once :)\n\n\n\nI've tried to replicate part 3 of the example file but when I select 3 for fan driven ventilation my component doesn't change to give me fan options (like I believe it should). Am I missing a key step somewhere?\u00a0\n\nAlso whenever I close and reopen my gh file the EPsetzoneschedule component goes red and comes up with an error about ventilation schedules which I am a bit baffled about as nothing has changed in the interim.\u00a0\n\nDo you if anyone has posted any examples on how to set up an apartment building multizone Honeybee model? I've been trying to put this together from scratch (I'm very new to Honeybee) and it would be much easier to follow someone else's example.
