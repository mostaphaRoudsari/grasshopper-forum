{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI would like to know if anybody knows a good way of controlling natural ventilation based on the difference between Indoor and Outdoor temperatures in an energy analysis.\n\nI thought this was how\u00a0****Honeybee Set EP Air**** **Flow** worked but apparently not as it still opens the window when T(out) &gt; T(in) (I get positive heat gains in this case).\n\n\n\nI basically want to use sensible natural cooling when possible and relevant, i.e. when the 2 following conditions are met :\n\n\n\nI know this is possible in EP but I have the feeling it is not yet implemented in HB ?

But then again, this would change the simulation result and thus T(in).. so maybe after a few iteration you could consider that you result is quite good but it makes it quite complicated to run ..\n\n\n\nAbraham :\n\nI read the discussion, but it does not solve my problem..<br/>The problem is that the component allows you to specify a range for T(in) and T(out) separately but for instance if I want to use natural cooling, then I want to cool when :\n\nT(in) &gt; 24\u00b0C \u00a0IF T(out) &lt; T(in)\n\nFor instance, if T(in) = 25\u00b0C and T(out) = 26\u00b0C, I don't really want to open the windows, which is what this component does.\n\n\n\nAurelien\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aurelien Keller", "created_at": "January 30, 2017 at 2:15pm", "created_by": "AurelienKeller", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nJust an update on the situation,\n\nThe best way I found right now is to implement several components with a 1\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C difference between indoor and outdoor temperature, but there is surely a bette way of doing this.<br/>For instance :\n\none for 25\u00b0C&gt; T(in) &gt; 23\u00b0C and T(out) &lt; 23\u00b0C\n\none for 27\u00b0C&gt; T(in) &gt; 25\u00b0C and T(out) &lt; 25\u00b0C\n\none for 29\u00b0C&gt; T(in) &gt; 27\u00b0C and T(out) &lt; 27\u00b0C\n\netc etc ...\n\n\n\nBut this is quite an ugly solution, so still wondering how we could do it in a better way !
