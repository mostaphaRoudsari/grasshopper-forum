{"body": "\nHey everyone,\n\n\n\nNeed to clarify something bugging me. When we create zones through surfaces, and then in one or more of those surfaces we create custom geometry for windows, do we have to link both the opaque surface and the opaque surface+glazing to the create zones icon? I would think just one but don't know why i'm not sure.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 24, 2015 at 3:23am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Kind of a silly question", "replies": [{"body": "\nTheodoros,<br/> The windows are hosted by the walls they are located on. When you assign a window to a surface in the proper component, this component contains both the wall and the window and this is the one you need to connect to the CreateZone component. Don't connect the surface component previous to the window inclusion.<br/>\nIn short, you are right in your thinking.<br/>\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 24, 2015 at 3:34am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks for clearing it up Abraham,\n\n\n\nSometimes I get stuck in silly things.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 24, 2015 at 3:48am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}]}]}
