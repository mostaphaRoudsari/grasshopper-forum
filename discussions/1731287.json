{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\n\n\nI'm experiencing for the first time a strange issue with the Honeybee EnergyPlus simulation components.\n\nWhen connecting the \"Honeybee_generate Output\" component to the \"Run Energy Sim\", I don't get any cooling energy results nor mechanical ventilation results.\n\nWhen leaving the \"simulationOutputs_\" input of the \"Run Energy Sim\" as default, I get the cooling energy results. I still don't get the mechanical ventilation energy...\n\n\n\nHere you can find attached the \"report file\". It seems that the problem is coming from the .rdd file. Some variables related to ventilation or cooling can't be found in the .rdd but are written in the .idf.\n\n\n\nWould you have any solution to help me resolve this issue?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\nAymeric\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vslvlu4m03OdvnicM0pi4aqkvVUkvPw45uXlpZ-ZhQRER4fwemDTTOUTE37dZMHMotUgKdElWBWGqcyiiiFTzZg0dcn6rCDg/Honeybee_EPresults_error.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vslvlu4m03OdvnicM0pi4aqkvVUkvPw45uXlpZ-ZhQRER4fwemDTTOUTE37dZMHMotUgKdElWBWGqcyiiiFTzZg0dcn6rCDg/Honeybee_EPresults_error.JPG)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vslvlu4m03MQeEtNikUNKzxEOKqsBR35-RFYs0WI4q-L2n0lhqUtPbayBTq5zDsj-pDfZ-WFMfyOH8ZE2JGP1Dy5GRaH55mO/Honeybee_EPresults_error_2.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vslvlu4m03MQeEtNikUNKzxEOKqsBR35-RFYs0WI4q-L2n0lhqUtPbayBTq5zDsj-pDfZ-WFMfyOH8ZE2JGP1Dy5GRaH55mO/Honeybee_EPresults_error_2.JPG)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vslvlu4m03NEN-OCOH*6sAnE0zVCoFHGAztDgzvDvfGVH4nRxpDWesnlbjqvSyKyk5SS24b8qReIcb88*chEh2VxvHTbQOWb/Honeybee_EPresults_error_3.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vslvlu4m03NEN-OCOH*6sAnE0zVCoFHGAztDgzvDvfGVH4nRxpDWesnlbjqvSyKyk5SS24b8qReIcb88*chEh2VxvHTbQOWb/Honeybee_EPresults_error_3.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1731284", "name": "Honeybee_ReadEP_results_error.txt"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1731285", "name": "unnamed.rdd"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1731286", "name": "unnamed.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Aymeric", "created_at": "April 11, 2017 at 4:46am", "created_by": "AymericDELABACHELERIE", "topic": "Honeybee_ReadEP results issue", "replies": [{"body": "\nAymeric,\n\nThe fact that some of the requested outputs are not in the rdd is normal. \u00a0The \"Generate EP Output\" component requests outputs for all different types of HVAC systems and these are meant to be ignored if no such HVAC system is in the IDF. \u00a0Your issue is happening for some other reason.
