{"body": "\nHello all!\n\n\n\nI am writing my master thesis on innovative building performance simulation software and how useful they are in architectural design. As I am trying many different geometrical configurations, I have a problem regarding a single surface that is marked as \"ceiling\" by Honeybee's Adjacency module , while it should be an outdoor \"roof\". Is there anyway I could change its type manually or tweak the settings of Adjacency module so it gets it right?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nEhsan\n\n\n\nP.S.

The issue happens because Honeybee fails to figure out the adjacencies\u00a0correctly. Do you really need the geometry to be this complex? EnergyPlus will probably take a good amount of time to run the analysis for this geometry.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/c2myy45ArwM4Y-LsuVbR9eA-gDIzf7i2dM1EelIcUPj8GmOsN5ATfxLXigNlFw31WCYzGBobYkH72yk6nbE7wga5gy5fulqv/adjacency.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/c2myy45ArwM4Y-LsuVbR9eA-gDIzf7i2dM1EelIcUPj8GmOsN5ATfxLXigNlFw31WCYzGBobYkH72yk6nbE7wga5gy5fulqv/adjacency.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 9, 2016 at 10:12am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHoneybee can handle complex geometries but EnergyPlus is not designed to handle a lot of faces.
