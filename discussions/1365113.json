I am not sure if different versions of E+ or Daysim would matter, but it does seem odd if you are simply using the same \"imaged\" computers and the same gh file that the results would be different...\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "September 22, 2015 at 4:11pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "replies": [{"body": "\nRadiance uses a stochastic sampling for calculation and 5-10% difference is expected.

My understanding is that you're getting two different optimum options based on the result of the optimization algorithm. It can have several reasons such as finding a local optima instead of the global optima, or having a weak objective function. This doesn't necessary have to do with Honeybee's daylight analysis. To have a better understanding about what is happening you can re-run the best cases against each other and compare the results. Your problem may have several local optima.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 23, 2015 at 10:06am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1365113"}
