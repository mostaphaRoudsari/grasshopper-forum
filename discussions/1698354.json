{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\n\n\nI would like to simulate the effect of reflections of beam solar irradiance and concentration due to concave aspect of a facad (as for the 20 Fenchurch Street building in London).\n\n\n\nI read this post on the same subject:\u00a0[http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-Marc...](http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004856.html)\n\n\n\nBut I don't understand exactly how to assign the materials to the surface.\n\n\n\nWhen I use the Honeybee_CreateHBSrfs component it gives me an error:\n\n\n\n1.
