And I encounter this problem. I have 2 massing one in a L shape the other a simple rectangle. Both of them are connected trough one wall (see the image)\n\n1. Mass to zones does not create the first floor of one of the massing (the L shaped one)\n\n2. Add glazing by ratio (the one that lets you chose to brake up the windows or not) creates a strange window Srf. at the connection of the L shaped massing.\n\n\n\nAttached the GH and Rhino file.\n\n\n\nAny Ideas\n\n\n\nThank you all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1097944", "name": "2volumesTest.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1097945", "name": "2volumesTest.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "July 4, 2014 at 7:33pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "Glazing Creator and Mass2Zone problems", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\nAs far as I can tell the issues that you are addressing all have been solved in the new version.
