What is bizzare (as you can see in the image) is the fact that this point can see behind the walls!\n\nAlso you have provided ain image with a transparent shading mask, is ti possible to explain me how you did it?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nKostas\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1140730", "name": "image1.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "kostas mourkos", "created_at": "October 1, 2014 at 8:38am", "created_by": "kostasmourkos", "topic": "inquires regarding the shading mask component", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Kostas,\n\nDidn't get well the \"behind the walls\" issue, but for the transparency you have 2 options:\n\n1. Using the LB_shadingMask (as you are doing) there is no option in GH. Just to bake the resulting geometry and do the transparency directly in Rhino.\n\n2. Use the LB_shadingMaskII (the one with the colors). Then you can play with the color and transparency if you conect the appropriate outputs to a CustomPrevie component. The pitfall is that is a kind of proof of concept version of the component and can take some time to do the calculation.

Higher numbers input here will ensure a greater accuracy but will also take longer.

As Chris mentioned sky can be as dense as you want. There is no limitation. The reason that I put limitation on genCumulativeSky is that it can take very long for denser skies and it won't do that much for accuracy of the results.\n\n\n\nAlso looking to Kostas image it might be a good idea to break the top surface also in pieces so it gives more accurate results.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 2, 2014 at 4:48am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi all,\n\nMany thanks for your answers,\n\nKostas\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "kostas mourkos", "created_at": "October 4, 2014 at 3:48am", "created_by": "kostasmourkos", "replies": []}]}]}
