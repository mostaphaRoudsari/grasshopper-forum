Just add them to the library and use the name or connect the full material definition to the component.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Fp4OwEQ0362gxAbGlB2nWDUEnEVudVPlYZzs08WxbIo*u2IgjH*yL9HgxKiHXQM*sZe0rw*Axo2juALGaNw1ET224ohpROwN/prism_modeling.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Fp4OwEQ0362gxAbGlB2nWDUEnEVudVPlYZzs08WxbIo*u2IgjH*yL9HgxKiHXQM*sZe0rw*Axo2juALGaNw1ET224ohpROwN/prism_modeling.png)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Fp4OwEQ0363ZHzCGuNBVNnnxwYQJeEmpesYzLN1hFlGacuxRvjizY2OEAg88j7P6k87HLwUqZEcXuvSDB35kYKk5ICW036ti/prism_glass_1_IMG_Perspective.PNG\" width=\"619\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Fp4OwEQ0363ZHzCGuNBVNnnxwYQJeEmpesYzLN1hFlGacuxRvjizY2OEAg88j7P6k87HLwUqZEcXuvSDB35kYKk5ICW036ti/prism_glass_1_IMG_Perspective.PNG)\n\nI made an example file based on this document:\u00a0[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.4214.pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.4214.pdf) - Check page 12. There are references that are mentioned in the document that you can check to learn more about the input values. I played with radiance input parameters but couldn't get that far with my laptop. I really like to what a high-res render would look like and if it is possible to get different colors by setting up the input parameters for prism surface correctly.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1409959", "name": "prism.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 25, 2015 at 8:10pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nFirst of all thank you for the quick reply!\n\nI'll try to apply your script on my model and I'll keep you update on next results.\n\nThank you also for the document you put, it will be essential for my design.\n\n\n\nBye,\n\n\n\nAlessandro\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alessandro Corso", "created_at": "November 26, 2015 at 5:08am", "created_by": "AlessandroCorso", "replies": []}]}
