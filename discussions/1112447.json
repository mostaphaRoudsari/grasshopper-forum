{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI want to know how to solve the problem as title says. Because I want to calculated the percentage of hours with illuminance uniformity over 0.7 occupying the total working hours. So firstly I need all the illuminance values to calculate the hourly uniformity. The method in the figure can only read one hour once.\n\nThank you for help.\n\nBests,\n\nDan\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/xLJQfJNYZ-xlEoLOOkV-zbbPBF2cZ0YGu03TtTzv5qE8dH4LDRFl8nIrdW8GE1Wl6CL6owaH8ilZS-FCp7*RuFniE8n6U-mJ/1.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/xLJQfJNYZ-xlEoLOOkV-zbbPBF2cZ0YGu03TtTzv5qE8dH4LDRFl8nIrdW8GE1Wl6CL6owaH8ilZS-FCp7*RuFniE8n6U-mJ/1.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Hou", "created_at": "August 8, 2014 at 7:21am", "created_by": "DanHou", "topic": "How to read all hourly grid illuminance throughout the year?", "replies": [{"body": "\nHello Dan,\n\nI had your problem too and I solved it by this way:\n\n\n\nIt takes quite a lot (10 minutes), but you get all the data you need. I had a 72-point grid, so I had 72*8760 numbers. It's up to you manage the database you create: if you have a n-point grid the record you create is:\n\n\n\nthan you can manage all your record as you want. I used it to find the trend during the year to calculate with genetic\u00a0algorithm the electrical light requirement and see if it matched to Daysim.

Still it takes some time as it has to generate all the branches.
