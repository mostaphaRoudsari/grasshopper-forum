{"body": "\nHi, I just started learning ladybug. Recently, I tried to make a grid-based analysis\u00a0with manually\u00a0assigned windows. However, after I finished battery map based on tutorial file\u00a0006_Parametric_GridBasedAnalysis, the simulation did not run. Could you please help me take a look what may be wrong? Honey bee did not response after I switch the boolean toggles.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/XxiqNhEdfHDip-WhLr17ffZVpEiEQdK5-8Nw-OxZsSTpRci6lAx4pXn1fv4mdyXDupn04OdBaa77WvJNsQYyeLES8ov46*VI/Gridperspective.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/XxiqNhEdfHDip-WhLr17ffZVpEiEQdK5-8Nw-OxZsSTpRci6lAx4pXn1fv4mdyXDupn04OdBaa77WvJNsQYyeLES8ov46*VI/Gridperspective.png)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/XxiqNhEdfHBCBlqrQjr8muCS0LAe6ZPXWo9*am6JXi7WNtpxRhUtcDYJFlvCseUYPnD*U-00HMp5c*OtkpQXFjg3RCDBAMwx/Grid.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/XxiqNhEdfHBCBlqrQjr8muCS0LAe6ZPXWo9*am6JXi7WNtpxRhUtcDYJFlvCseUYPnD*U-00HMp5c*OtkpQXFjg3RCDBAMwx/Grid.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1768145", "name": "a.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Considering", "created_at": "June 12, 2017 at 10:06am", "created_by": "Considering", "topic": "Grid Analysis did not response with no error information", "replies": [{"body": "\nAlways debug backwards from the component that doesn't work.\n\n1.
