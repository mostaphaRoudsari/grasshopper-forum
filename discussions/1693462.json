You defined the surface type of a wall as Window. See red group in the image below. The input needs to be o instead of 5. Another issue you had is connceting a window construction to the same wall. I disconnected (so now it has a default construction) and connected it to the HB_addHBGlz (see blue line).\n\nI also rebuilt those surfaces (so they are not trimmed) but at the end there is no need for that. But just in case i left the, so you can get the idea from the image.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/NxE20jujyI*hJWcefshkP3K9bFBSt0d-sa7pIcR*cHEskMc3A05msKWh2CKKTvRQbhqopCffN1kQj1U21NeQ7korwqHn4Ops/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NxE20jujyI*hJWcefshkP3K9bFBSt0d-sa7pIcR*cHEskMc3A05msKWh2CKKTvRQbhqopCffN1kQj1U21NeQ7korwqHn4Ops/Capture.JPG)After those changes it runs fine.\n\nBTW, i would not define a door as you did.

You can not assign an opaque material to a window. Right now you can not define a door element in HB and probably it will be tricky to do that. What i suggest is to define the window properties for the door with a VT of 0 (assuming is doesn't have any transparency), U value as you need and SHGC also as you need/know.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1696624", "name": "TrimmedSurface3_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 20, 2017 at 11:23pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nUpdated file with an example of the construction.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1696586", "name": "TrimmedSurface3_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 21, 2017 at 4:28am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi\u00a0Abraham,\n\n\n\nThank you very much, I will research your suggestion.\n\n\n\nSolon.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Solon", "created_at": "February 21, 2017 at 11:07pm", "created_by": "w9002", "replies": []}]}]}
