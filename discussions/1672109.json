{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\nI am running a Daylight simulation with Honeybee, and I am trying to get some results also with the last version of Diva.\n\nI was wondering if there is a way to run the daylight simulation only for a specific amount of time. I'm modeling a school, so I'm interested only in what happens during the months of school occupancy.\n\nIs there a specific component I can use or is there a way to add the schedule that I create?\n\nThank you all for your work and time.\n\nCarlie\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carlie_3", "created_at": "January 15, 2017 at 4:43am", "created_by": "Carlie_3", "topic": "Question about daylight simulation with Honeybee", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Carlie,\n\nPlease find a sample for Honeybee.\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1672441", "name": "Daylighting.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "January 15, 2017 at 8:46am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\nThank you very much for your help.\n\nI was wondering: why do you have to add the ground outside in the simulation?\n\nThank you very much,\n\n\n\nCarlie\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carlie_3", "created_at": "January 15, 2017 at 9:18am", "created_by": "Carlie_3", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nCarlie,\n\nIdeally, all the context geometry shall be\u00a0modelled.

I'm trying to run the daylight analysis as said before. For what concern the daylight analysis everything seems to work properly but when I'm trying to calculate the SunLightAnalysis and the ViewAnalysis inside my classroom, the result is always zero. Do you have any idea of why is that? Is it because these component work only for the outdoor? It seems that the window is not recognize.\n\nI don't know if I was clear enough, so I've attached the gh file on which I'm working on.\n\n\n\nThank you again for your time,\n\nCarlie\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1672358", "name": "Daylight_analysis_CS.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Carlie_3", "created_at": "January 15, 2017 at 11:05am", "created_by": "Carlie_3", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nCarlie,\n\nYou're absolutely right.
