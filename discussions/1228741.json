If you created your zones from individual surfaces then the problem is that one zone is probably not closed. You can quickly verify that if you have an open brep in your list of breps. Try hiding all zones and then visualize each zone surface by surface to find the culprit. At least that was the issue in my case.\n\n<br/>Edit: It could also be that a wall is referenced twice in one zone.\n\n\n\nHope that helps!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 21, 2015 at 4:35am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Theodoros,\n\n\n\nThanks for your response, I checked each individual zone over and over again to make sure they are closed but I still have the same problem.

I watched the first 12 videos, over the last week. Great videos and an awesome grasshopper plug-in, thanks a bunch. \u00a0I grabbed all the new components from github, then tried again, but I still have no luck. So what I did is I modeled the building again in Rhino and reduced the curves then I imported the geometry into GH and used the HoneyBee zone by surfaces component , but I noticed that after I grabbed the new components I get a \"NULL\" if I plug a panel to the final zone. \u00a0Finally I decided to model a very simple box and grab all its surfaces to create a zone , and to my surprise I still get \"NULL\" Am I doing something wrong ? here are what I did to create this one zone box\n\n1- modeled a 3d box in Rhino\n\n2- Exploded it\n\n3- In grasshopper I created HB-surfaces ( Floor, Ceiling, 4 individual walls and added I glazing by ratio to one of the walls)\n\nHere is an image, also I attached the file, the box components are grouped with an orange background. Now I'm convinced that I have a bug or something because it can't get easier than creating a zone from a simple box and yet I get a \"NULL\" message.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/GutZeHmFpMti-tD3Hyoo*BgqK1uQhbNj9tqnDmU9KhnScGzwpdxATJJMaFyCjfCt9CndI20G-lZipjoxbnWUQfEAwTQ8MqD9/Canvasat234140.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/GutZeHmFpMti-tD3Hyoo*BgqK1uQhbNj9tqnDmU9KhnScGzwpdxATJJMaFyCjfCt9CndI20G-lZipjoxbnWUQfEAwTQ8MqD9/Canvasat234140.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1230020", "name": "BOX.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1230021", "name": "Base_case_All-zone.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 10:57pm", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Rania,\n\n\n\nYou need to flatten the surface inputs in the CreateZone component.
