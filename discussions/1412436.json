{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n<br/> I'm actually trying to figure out if it's possible to add a shading control to a window in the Energy+ script by using some HoneyBee components. In particular I would like to add a setpoint, for example \"OnIfHighSolarOnWindow\" with a setpoint of 120 W/m2, as you can do in the IDF Editor of the Energy+ tool. See screenshots below.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/STKcnUst*ZQ0wgqLD32ckQBRVNXiQFs4KbUfFDwt2P8GR2v1kCuQOWcFPnjPTCfqfllM4CxJO5iF3cbi*3UausPj*Y0t-5ey/Capture.JPG\" width=\"466\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/STKcnUst*ZQ0wgqLD32ckQBRVNXiQFs4KbUfFDwt2P8GR2v1kCuQOWcFPnjPTCfqfllM4CxJO5iF3cbi*3UausPj*Y0t-5ey/Capture.JPG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/STKcnUst*ZRDwIXY5KSyJP43WsuO6LGwnZIlYof-pMIR2KgFpislF4C4n4QLCxEYXExNlSQyRE*3QK68IThwUTZxGpCyxHFs/Capture2.JPG\" width=\"465\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/STKcnUst*ZRDwIXY5KSyJP43WsuO6LGwnZIlYof-pMIR2KgFpislF4C4n4QLCxEYXExNlSQyRE*3QK68IThwUTZxGpCyxHFs/Capture2.JPG)\n\nI'm wondering if I necessarily have to dive into the wonderful world of the \"additionalStrings\" input in the HoneyBee_RunEnergySimulation panel or if there's an easier way since I'm not really confident with scripts.<br/><br/>\n\nThanks a lot in advance,<br/>Claudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Marini", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 4:05am", "created_by": "ClaudioMarini", "topic": "Shading Control with a defined setpoint", "replies": [{"body": "\nIn this [POST](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/shades-generated-by-window-shades-generator-are-not-shown-by)\u00a0there are some good tips by Chris Mackey\u00a0about how the shades work, but I could't find a solution to my problem.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Marini", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 4:33am", "created_by": "ClaudioMarini", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Claudio\n\n\n\nAfter looking through the code I see that Chris hasn't implemented this functionality.

Never had the chance to thank you before so, thanks!<br/><br/>Unfortunately today I've had too many things to do and I didn't manage to check properly Anton's panel. At a first look it looks great anyway.<br/>Just, if you add this updated component to HoneyBee I would suggest you to add another input. Actually the preset for the Shading Control Type is \"ALWAYSON\" but it needs to be replaced with \"OnIfHighSolarOnWindow\" for example. Otherwise the setpoint is useless I think.<br/>I solved it just by replacing every \"ALWAYSON\" there was in the code with the name of the new desired type and it apparently works fine (I'll update if something get wrong), but maybe you have a nice way to implement it into your HoneyBee panel.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your help.<br/>Claudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Marini", "created_at": "December 1, 2015 at 11:06am", "created_by": "ClaudioMarini", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\nThank you for the nice comments and the feedback.
