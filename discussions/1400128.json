{"body": "\nHi There!\n\n\n\nSince I updated HB/LB to the latest version I am having a problem. I am missing a lot of information in terms of the EP library including material and constructions. For example, I dont have the clear window material or the AIRWall construction. I believe I am doing things right in the scripts and cant find why. I am attaching an image. I believe that in theory I should be seeing more constructions right? Please help me and thank you for your time.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1400127", "name": "Capture.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Jose Holguin", "created_at": "November 13, 2015 at 2:53pm", "created_by": "JoseRafaelHolguin", "topic": "Missing EP Libraries/Constructions", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Jose,\n\nCan you check output of Honeybee_honeybee. It should give you a short report about the number of constructions and materials. Make sure the libraries are downloaded on your machine.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 14, 2015 at 6:18am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI believe I fixed it, I deleted the master template idf file from C:\\ladybug and downloaded a new one from a thread here in the forum. The old one I deleted was a very small file and when i opened it with a text editor it was pretty empty. The new one seems fine.
