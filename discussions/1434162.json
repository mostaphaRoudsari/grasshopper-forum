{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nI feel quite confusing about my result for Indoor Micro-climate map, see as below. When I set the up limit and bottom limit for my legend, it turned out to be all blue. How can the temperature that low in July?\u00a0\n\nPS: I use the Example file and Shanghai weather data.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ekAtSD9WG6LPJ2WJ7*zpyBU4aIDyTkaoiopJBdTKcgi9rhFUfXznYPl3Z2nmK*1Cdwow3-51JxdReWbBPKfIgyh0emn7YWPK/2.jpg?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ekAtSD9WG6LPJ2WJ7*zpyBU4aIDyTkaoiopJBdTKcgi9rhFUfXznYPl3Z2nmK*1Cdwow3-51JxdReWbBPKfIgyh0emn7YWPK/2.jpg)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ekAtSD9WG6JNnFAMYpjIfn0Z7NalZpwM3uArDXwZchIxz8tALNwXD5K1qdZb-Pvna743xfED7wweWzMNRtzuxzK5Fv5t8K9t/3.jpg?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ekAtSD9WG6JNnFAMYpjIfn0Z7NalZpwM3uArDXwZchIxz8tALNwXD5K1qdZb-Pvna743xfED7wweWzMNRtzuxzK5Fv5t8K9t/3.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Maria X", "created_at": "January 8, 2016 at 1:49am", "created_by": "MariaX", "topic": "Abnormal result for indoor micro-climate map result", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 8, 2016 at 8:19am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nDear Abraham,\n\n\n\nThanks for your explain and extremely sorry for my delay.
