{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nFor some of you who are interested in case studies of using analysis and optimization here is a recent publication which is using Ladybug and [Galapagos](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/galapagos)\u00a0for geometry optimization.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/CDpOn5M7-BsbHTE5CxJX7jMTGlj5iZFOMbvskLEPYunVMn7ubZGdYsSl257c-vCYXNgmqDcxkGbcvRpRxH7NF8a0OvPl-6Ex/AgentBasedGeometryOptimizationForSolarLight.jpg\" width=\"645\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/CDpOn5M7-BsbHTE5CxJX7jMTGlj5iZFOMbvskLEPYunVMn7ubZGdYsSl257c-vCYXNgmqDcxkGbcvRpRxH7NF8a0OvPl-6Ex/AgentBasedGeometryOptimizationForSolarLight.jpg)\n\n\n\nYou can read and download the full paper from this link:\n\n[Yun Kyu Yi, Hyoungsub Kim, Agent-based geometry optimization with G...](http://authors.elsevier.com/a/1QS-Q,tRcsG2M)\n\n\n\nThe paper is available for free download until March 21!\n\n\n\nAlso Dr. Yi shared an example with me on a similar topic last year which took me for ever to update! I attached the updated definition. [Here is the the .pdf file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wa8k9t815m290rs/LADYBUG-YUNKYUYI.pdf?dl=0)\u00a0for anyone who is interested. My apologies for the delay!\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/CDpOn5M7-Bu9rUppc8WVpUt9waCn*KkWSfU7mljGQxPMu5-4LLXlBc4XGY7NhlUvBei4NfQUnvN*Y3Z2zcRbQnEDH0XD0SDF/Capture.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/CDpOn5M7-Bu9rUppc8WVpUt9waCn*KkWSfU7mljGQxPMu5-4LLXlBc4XGY7NhlUvBei4NfQUnvN*Y3Z2zcRbQnEDH0XD0SDF/Capture.PNG)\n\n\n\n**Again all the credit for the paper goes to Yun Kyu Yi and Hyoungsub Kim and for the example file goes to Yun Kyu Yi and his class ARCH-632 Performance &amp; Design - Parametric Integration at University of Pennsylvania. I'm just sharing them here.**\n\n\n\nHappy #ValentinesDay!\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1224711", "name": "04-Box-2point-control-ladybug-radiation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 14, 2015 at 10:00am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "topic": "[Knowledge Sharing] Agent-based geometry optimization for tall apartment\u2019s solar right", "replies": [{"body": "\nthanks\u00a0[Mostapha](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/MostaphaSadeghipour)\u00a0,\u00a0Yun Kyu Yi and Hyoungsub Kim for the paper :) that's really a kind of you :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "February 14, 2015 at 11:42am", "created_by": "monarezk", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nNice!
