{"body": "\nI am trying to visualise the zone cooling loads for a structure, 5 floors at a time (since for some reason, Rhino would crash if i create additional floors and assign windows).\n\n\n\nAnyways, **the Colour Zones by EP result component would not output anything once i connect cooling load from the read EP result component**.\u00a0\n\nI have attached my GH file.\n\nP.S: you need to toggle True for many components. Also, materials assigned need to be updated every time the file is opened the file by double-clicking on the corresponding text boxes to the material creating components (again, not sure why, but i think that's unimportant)\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nHere is a screenshot of outputs from Write EPW and Write OSM files (with same inputs).

I think the answer lies in the image Nishant shared. Due to some reason, the output from Export to OpenStudio component does not have correct number of branches. The zoneData input on Honeybee_Color Zones By EP results has TreeAccess. If you could find why this branching is not right, that would solve the problem I believe.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "February 8, 2017 at 12:06am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nOk . So if you remove the context surfaces then the non-Convex error should go away. The other problem that I see from your attached image is that the cooling output from read Ep result is not a tree for Export to Open Studio component. That's the reason why you're not able to visualize the results. You'll need to make it output 45 branches like you have from EnergyPlus Component.

The HVAC system that you're applying is Chilled Beams + DOAS. This is a central system so electricity is consumed at the chiller plant level and therefore, you're not receiving zonewise\u00a0cooling energy.
