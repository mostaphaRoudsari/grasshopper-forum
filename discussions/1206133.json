Thank you for reporting.\n\n\n\nThe answer is that it depends on how you generate the sky. If the sky is selected for an HOY then the values will be in wh/m2, otherwise the values are in Kwh/m2. Based on your image and the values I guess that you're generating an annual sky and so Kwh/m2 is correct.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 18, 2015 at 7:02pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Bedeschi", "created_at": "January 18, 2015 at 11:49pm", "created_by": "FrancescoBedeschi", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you for posting, Francesco. \u00a0I think that Mostapha and I each thought that the other was going to fix the issue and neither of us ended up addressing it. \u00a0Rest assured that it will be taken care of before the stable release that is happening soon.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 21, 2015 at 5:18pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nFrancesco,\n\nI am just letting you know that this is now fixed. \u00a0All of the Ladybug radiation components now use kWh, as do all of the Honeybee energy modeling components. \u00a0The only place where Wh still appear (in all of the components) is in the import of radiation with the Import EPW component (I figure that we should stay true to the EPW file).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/rUrHnDSl8N95u8QPIRYk9iL7iDkcCMaP2Hl2Lwwd82EEEc1k*klBWtBPTrvtoAXvKH*Ia95P0Y8kY-Wzj0e5a93hEGGgwxIq/RadinkWh.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/rUrHnDSl8N95u8QPIRYk9iL7iDkcCMaP2Hl2Lwwd82EEEc1k*klBWtBPTrvtoAXvKH*Ia95P0Y8kY-Wzj0e5a93hEGGgwxIq/RadinkWh.PNG)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 29, 2015 at 4:19am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris!<br/><br/>Maybe I've been sitting at the computer for too long, or does this seem a bit strange?<br/><br/>A mass addition of the radiation results gives the same results as the total radiation output. <br/><br/>[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/gX09JerEUx3EJx*cSV7NDp-DvW6u5CsTXMxymlm5XXYeuxoDOysB*AfL7YqfeU9CZkh4iDX*zUzkkjRyNJKvIhY2TKIjA0C5/RadResults.PNG\" width=\"649\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/gX09JerEUx3EJx*cSV7NDp-DvW6u5CsTXMxymlm5XXYeuxoDOysB*AfL7YqfeU9CZkh4iDX*zUzkkjRyNJKvIhY2TKIjA0C5/RadResults.PNG)<br/><br/>The info for each of the outputs says...<br/><br/>\"RadiationResults:\u00a0The amount of radiation in kWh/m2 falling on the input test _geometry at each of the test points.\"<br/><br/>\"TotalRadiation:\u00a0The total radiation in kWh falling on the input test _geometry. \u00a0This is computed through a mass addition of all the kWh/m2 results at each of the test points and then multiplying this by the area of all the the surfaces in the test _geometry.\"<br/><br/>The upper panel in the image should therefore be displaying the results in kWh/m2 and the lower panel should be displaying the results in kWh... but they give the same result.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "\u00d6rn Erlendsson", "created_at": "March 2, 2015 at 9:40am", "created_by": "OErnErlendsson", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Orn,\n\nIs the grid size equal to 1 m2? \u00a0If not, you are right that I made a typo in the description. \u00a0Mostapha, are the results in total radiation divided by the area of each grid cell? \u00a0If not, than an output name of \"totalRadiation\" might not be so appropriate.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 2, 2015 at 3:41pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nSeems to be fixed in the latest version (March 8th).
