I've attached the file with internalized geometry does anyone have any idea whats going on?\n\n\n\nMany thanks!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1516727", "name": "Radiation_Analysis 4.25 AJZ.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "April 25, 2016 at 4:11pm", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "topic": "Strange results from ladybug solar radiation analysis", "replies": [{"body": "\nCheck the input for context geometry.
