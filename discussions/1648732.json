One could make a mistake by not adjusting Visible Tranmittance in E+ material to match the Radiance material.\u00a0\n\nThanks again for your help and support\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "December 1, 2016 at 10:36am", "created_by": "LillyGD", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1648732"}
