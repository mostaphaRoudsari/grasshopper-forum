{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI am trying to create very simple custom schedules for heating and cooling setpoints to use with OpenStudio, but the results I get for heating and cooling consumption are far too low. Is there a problem with OpenStudio reading custom set point schedules, or have I done something wrong? The .gh file is attached<br/>Thanks\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1682662", "name": "Testing setpoint schedule.gh"}], "created_by_name": "James Crowley", "created_at": "February 1, 2017 at 10:12am", "created_by": "JamesCrowley", "topic": "Having trouble with Openstudio and custom set point schedules", "replies": [{"body": "\nJames,\n\nDid you run the same analysis with EnergyPlus and received different results?
