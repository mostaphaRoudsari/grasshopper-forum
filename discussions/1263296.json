{"body": "\nHey Guys,\n\n\n\nI have a typical floor plan that we are trying to analyze to determine different glazing ECMs (glazing type and WWR). I'm noticing that the results from the Ideal Air Loads runs are showing very high heating demand (~350kWh/sm/year for example with a 2009 IECC glazing construction), also with the cooling demand high as well but not as equally outrageous (~50 kWh/sm/year). We were expecting something in the 25-30 kWh/sm/year range for heating and cooling loads each. \u00a0I've double checked all inputs and they seem to be legit. Any idea for these high loads? So perplexed.\n\nI was hoping to be able to add a mechanical system to the model to get actual energy demand, not just the load. \u00a0When I used the component to change the mechanical system to one of the other off the shelf systems, the total thermal energy demand was not affected at all. \u00a0Was this because I did not have an air side and a plant side component plugged into the mech override component? What I was hoping to be able to do was to set a base off the shelf mech system, similar to the E+ example files that come with the E+ download. \u00a0Am I missing something?\n\nAlso, it seemed to consistently get errors when reading the surface data from the glazing. \u00a0I was unable to determine if this was causing the heating error.\n\nWe've modeled all of the zones around the perimeter as conditioned, and the core and plenum as unconditioned. \u00a0The floors are modeled as adiabatic. \u00a0Attached is the model and the gh script. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny help would be awesome.

Once these surfaces are oriented outwards you should see changes in energy use as E+ will be able to recognize the window\u00a0geometry.\n\n--J\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "JPE", "created_at": "April 15, 2015 at 8:17pm", "created_by": "JPE", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks J for your response.\n\nI had a look at your suggestions. \u00a0Several notes:\n\n1. I switched the simulation from \"Full Interior &amp; Exterior\" solar distribution to run on \"Full Exterior\" solar distribution. \u00a0This switch did get all of the severe E+ errors to disappear.\u00a0 Also, it initially got the glazing surface results to read. \u00a0Then I ran the simulation a second time and the results disappeared again. \u00a0Any idea why the surface results disappear the second go round? \u00a0\n\n2. \u00a0As for the surface normals, the normals of the surfaces coming out of the \"Glazing Based on Ratio\" component do seem to be oriented both in the correct direction, both oriented outward. See the image below. \u00a0I've also tested it using the Child Surface method with the \"addHBglz\" component, and all of those surfaces are also correctly oriented outward. \u00a0When I rerun both simulations, the surface data still does not read surface results for the glazing (it does read the surface results from opaque portion of the wall). \u00a0\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" height=\"308\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/rhqcRsJl7aRfhBxK**a1nS13OkYE6YorU-0gWwSdFVaIqAjE-10rwfKo*maFj*4LOb78H*hU2muxSB1Ia1xe3tKuEvs-2Jcg/GlazingSurfaceNormals.JPG?width=721\" width=\"607\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/rhqcRsJl7aRfhBxK**a1nS13OkYE6YorU-0gWwSdFVaIqAjE-10rwfKo*maFj*4LOb78H*hU2muxSB1Ia1xe3tKuEvs-2Jcg/GlazingSurfaceNormals.JPG)\n\n\n\n3. 3.Lastly, any suggests for getting an off the shelf mech system hooked up so the results will read as End Use Energy Consumption, rather than the Ideal Air Loads? \u00a0Any suggestions would be great!\n\nThanks for your help.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Patrick Keeney", "created_at": "April 17, 2015 at 3:26pm", "created_by": "PatrickKeeney", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n1.
