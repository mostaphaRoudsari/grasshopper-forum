I think it would have helped if you could have uploaded a simplified example file.\n\n\n\nIf you are running an energy analysis, you can calculate the bounding box for the other floors and use EPContextSrf to add them as context.\n\n\n\nIf it's a daylighting simulation then just generate the test points for this floor and connect all the zones to the component.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 11, 2015 at 2:41pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}], "id": "1290321"}
