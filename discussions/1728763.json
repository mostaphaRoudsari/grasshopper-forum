{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nIs it possible to change the Uref in \"ABLConditions\" in Butterfly, if meshes are already generated?\n\nI have tried with the component \"solutionParam\", but it shows:\n\n**1.

If you open your case folder, navigate to 0/ or 0.org/ and open ABLConditions file. You will find the Uref input there.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, I imagine you could try connecting your Wind tunnel component directly to the solution component (the end of your file). If you then change your Uref there (at the input of wind velocity of the wind tunnel component) and press true on write case only it should update your 0 folder without re-running blockMesh and/or SHM.\n\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 6, 2017 at 9:48pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nWell, we can/should actually give you access to ABLConditions. It's a special type of a dictionary. Can you open an issue for this on github?\n\n\n\nMeanwhile Theodore's suggestion will work for you. Once you generate the mesh you can set both of the components (blockMesh and snappyHexMesh) to false and connect the case directly from WindTunnel component to solution and run the analysis.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 7, 2017 at 6:15am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nGreat!
