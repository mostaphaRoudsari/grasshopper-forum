Where can you find/add materials/construction to Honeybee?\n\nQ2. How can you check the details of the materials/constructions in Honeybee?\n\n\n\n\n\n**A1.1. Radiance:**\n\nHoneybee loads default materials for Radiance internally. If you are interested you can overwrite default materials using Honeybee_RADDefaultMaterials component.\n\nTo add more materials to the library you can use several components to create the material and then use addToRADLibrary component to add them to library. Check example 002 &gt; ([https://app.box.com/s/znns0dtewd1tclicx74q](https://app.box.com/s/znns0dtewd1tclicx74q))\n\n\n\nFinally if you want to add some radiance material that you already have from another resource you can copy them to C:\\ladybug\\HoneybeeRadMaterials.mat and they will be loaded when you let the Honeybee fly.\n\n\n\n**A1.2. EnergyPlus**\n\nThe process for EnergyPlus is slightly different. EnergyPlus loads default materials/construction and schedules from\u00a0OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf\n\n\n\nAgain you can create your own materials and constructions using Honeybee components that you can find under 06|Material...\n\n\n\nIf you want to add your own material/construction/schedule you can add them to\u00a0userCustomEPLibrary.idf and they will be loaded every time that you let Honeybee fly.\n\n\n\n**A2.1. Radiance**\n\nFor Radiance you can use Honeybee_Call from Radiance Library to see the list of available materials and then use Radiance Info component to get the full string of information. Again check the example file.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hXj4gw9-MpOo7CI-q3LZ3-5bsrronoNDgewoSTRHprN7Ut6eBEObszDy*ndF-eJKSmv-a4uGj8QfI8nqWCnP96VHWRJRCJd6/radMaterial.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hXj4gw9-MpOo7CI-q3LZ3-5bsrronoNDgewoSTRHprN7Ut6eBEObszDy*ndF-eJKSmv-a4uGj8QfI8nqWCnP96VHWRJRCJd6/radMaterial.png)\n\n**A2.2. EnergyPlus**\n\nThe process for EnergyPlus is also similar to Radiance. The only difference is that there is a deconstruct component for each different type (material vs construction vs schedule). Here is an example:\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hXj4gw9-MpMImSBo643Ej-H*GkRWBxXUnu*OIbTERK-*szg8TOyt4uwgu9*ySZEBbd48xe1PbQucwOPbFfLdPCsIWfBBbrfS/EPMaterial_Construction.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hXj4gw9-MpMImSBo643Ej-H*GkRWBxXUnu*OIbTERK-*szg8TOyt4uwgu9*ySZEBbd48xe1PbQucwOPbFfLdPCsIWfBBbrfS/EPMaterial_Construction.png)\n\nHope this helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 30, 2014 at 7:13pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha,\n\n\u00a0I'm sorry to reply to you a little later.
