{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nI\u2019m currently road-testing Rhino, Grasshopper and Honeybee for daylighting analysis. I\u2019ve been using Ecotect as a front end for Radiance for years \u2013 but Ecotect isn\u2019t ageing well and it is time to move on\u2026 I am mostly preparing analysis for planning applications in accordance with BRE guidelines in the UK. I\u2019ve some, hopefully simple, questions for those of you who know Honeybee well and I\u2019d really appreciate your feedback / help. I\u2019m aware some of these queries are general Grasshopper rather than Honeybee questions.\n\nI\u2019ve attached my first simple model and grasshopper script \u2013 the culmination of a week of learning\u2026\n\nIn the first instance, I want to complete VSC analysis of windows in a model and I need to export the results for inclusion in a report. I need to be able to:\n\nI\u2019m sure this will be the first of many questions \u2013 but I really appreciate your help.\n\nMany thanks\n\nNick\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1477255", "name": "VSC_Tag_Model_1.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1477256", "name": "Working VSC Script.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Nick Devlin", "created_at": "March 4, 2016 at 5:07am", "created_by": "NickDevlin", "topic": "Object Reference Tagging and VSC Calculations", "replies": [{"body": "\nHere you go Nick.\n\nSee white group.\n\nI updated the file and some components needed to be reinserted.\n\nFor excel there are some ways to do that.
