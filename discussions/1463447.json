It's fixed now!\n\nAlso just in case you haven't seen it you can use section planes in Honeybee.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/w1RO3fq7oDYZmrRQxav8VgZU-s395QTLTebVMJUWjizYdBE0RtyxKkjuJyyTYxBZMLzLGGDhjTM*sX6VK633SRg9M50hHRSR/parallelViewWithSectionCut.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/w1RO3fq7oDYZmrRQxav8VgZU-s395QTLTebVMJUWjizYdBE0RtyxKkjuJyyTYxBZMLzLGGDhjTM*sX6VK633SRg9M50hHRSR/parallelViewWithSectionCut.png)\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1464462", "name": "parallelView_Export.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 16, 2016 at 11:02am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nWorks well now.<br/>Incredible response time :)\n\nThanks Mostapha.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ejnar Brendsdal", "created_at": "February 18, 2016 at 1:51am", "created_by": "EjnarBrendsdal", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1463447"}
