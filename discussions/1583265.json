{"body": "\nHello,\n\nWith the SolveAdjacencies HB component, is it possible to specify new EP constructions for more than one surface type? That is: specify a wall construction and also an interior window construction. This seems like a syntax question. I took a look at the ventilated DSF example, and searched for other \"solve\" situations in Hydra, but haven't found any examples showing multiple constructions yet.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, I can use the SetEPZoneIntConstr to re-define the surfaces after the surface mating. But any suggestions welcome!\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Novelli", "created_at": "August 17, 2016 at 10:13pm", "created_by": "NickNovelli", "topic": "Syntax for assigning different adjacency constructions?", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Nick, Can you help me to understand what do you exactly need.
