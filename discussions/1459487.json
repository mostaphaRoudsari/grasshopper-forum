{"body": "\nHey there,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI've experienced a number of small errors in my script that is reoccuring.\n\n\n\n1) I'm told to \"let Honeybee fly\" every single time I open the script.\u00a0\n\n\n\n2) After\u00a0\"let Honeybee fly\" then I normally recompute, from time to time recomputing the script solves all the \"orange ballons\" regarding letting Honeybee fly on the individual components, other times I've to reconnect the inputs on every component still having the\u00a0orange ballon.\u00a0\n\n\n\n3) A few times when opening the script I get a \"red ballon\" on the Run Energy Simulation component saying \"Solution Exception: DefaultSchedulesLib\". I've tried a number of different things to solve the problem, the only solution I've found so far is to replace the\u00a0Run Energy Simulation component itself.\u00a0<br/>I tried leaving the original\u00a0Run Energy Simulation component and place a new one next to it, and then run both with the exact same inputs. The old doesn't run and the new runs like normal (see attached picture)\n\n\n\nThe script is also attached.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI would be more than happy to hear any good suggestions how to solve these.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1459485", "name": "Pic1.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1459486", "name": "2016.02.10 - GH - M0018141-42 (Schedules Lib error).gh"}], "created_by_name": "Nickolaj Feldt Jensen", "created_at": "February 10, 2016 at 8:28am", "created_by": "NickolajFeldtJensen", "topic": "Reoccuring errors in my script", "replies": [{"body": "\nTry selecting the HB_HB and LB_LB and do ctrl+B (send to back) then ctrl+E (twice: Disable, enable).\n\nThis should make those components to be executed from now on first, before the others.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 10, 2016 at 8:42am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nHey Abraham,\n\n\n\nAlright thanks, I'll give it a try.\n\n\n\n- Nickolaj\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nickolaj Feldt Jensen", "created_at": "February 10, 2016 at 8:49am", "created_by": "NickolajFeldtJensen", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nctrl+B (send to back) ?\u00a0\n\ncool!\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Igor Mitri\u0107 Lavovski", "created_at": "February 10, 2016 at 9:28am", "created_by": "Igor425", "replies": []}]}]}
