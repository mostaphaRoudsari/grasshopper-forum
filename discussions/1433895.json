{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\n\nI am starting now with honeybee after I have been using ladybug.\n\nIn my laptop I had the problem that the ladybug component did not fly, due to the username with white space. Was easy to find the solution, just by seeting the c:/ladybug and connected it.\n\n\n\nSame thing happened with honeybee, so I did the same. I set a c:/honeybee into the panel and connected to the honeybee component. It is working.\n\n\n\nWhen I tried to set up an AIRWALL I had an error. I asked around and someone told me to bring into the canvas the\u00a0callFromEPConstrLibrary component, that displays an error.\n\n\n\nI enclose screenshots of the canvas.\n\n\n\nAny suggestion is gonna be very much appreciated.\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\n\nFederico\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1433893", "name": "problem_01.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1433894", "name": "problem_02.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Federico", "created_at": "January 8, 2016 at 1:39am", "created_by": "Federico587", "topic": "HONEYBEE CAN NOT LOAD MATERIAL LIBRARY", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Federico, Can you check the output of Honeybee_Honeybee component?
