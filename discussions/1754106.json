{"body": "\n\n\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am getting \"Index Out of Range:0\" error when I run shading analysis. Interestingly Honeybee populates the results in its corresponding folder but for some reasons it does not visualize it!\u00a0\n\n\n\nPlease see the attached file. The red circle positions where error occurs in grasshopper. Since I do have the results, I attached the \"annual Simulation\" folder.\n\n\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7gV9LwHC4QuV0JNdGpESU9ScDg/view?u...](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7gV9LwHC4QuV0JNdGpESU9ScDg/view?usp=sharing)\n\n\n\nBest\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "saram", "created_at": "May 19, 2017 at 10:51am", "created_by": "saram", "topic": "Index Out of Range", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi I have had similar errors, just replugging the lighting schedule might do the trick or try internalize data on the lighting schedule. that worked for me. I dont know if internalize data works for string-text inputs always, meaning when you open the definition next time, so you might have to do it again each time when you open the definition. I havent looked at your definition yet but.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "May 28, 2017 at 6:30pm", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nSara, Update honeybee!\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3Wsv3wQeZCAzkeh9hTgh-Am5jFf9a6Uw90vdr66A6h5ytldOPXyWSRpzGkuBH3cGsxkvsv2285fnhNseKhOuoj0MZI5gjRa1/read_results.png\" width=\"542\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3Wsv3wQeZCAzkeh9hTgh-Am5jFf9a6Uw90vdr66A6h5ytldOPXyWSRpzGkuBH3cGsxkvsv2285fnhNseKhOuoj0MZI5gjRa1/read_results.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 29, 2017 at 9:03am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}
