{"body": "\nGreeting Ladybug Community!\n\nThis is just to let you know that there will be a 3-hour workshop/webinar on Honeybee Daylight on April 24th. The workshop will cover all of the basics of setting up daylight simulations at a pace where those with Honeybee pre-installed can follow along. This will be followed by a faster, near-complete overview of all daylight simulation types and the application of the results to design.\n\nThe organizers of the webinar have greatly decreased the cost for registration to just $10 so, if you have been looking to pick up some knowledge on the daylighting tools, this is a great opportunity to get you started and obtain an overview of what you can do. For seasoned daylight users, I think you will find some new features covered in the workshop that you might not have been aware of initially.\n\nThe workshop is a part of a larger series on energy tools that you can find here ([http://www.performance.network/](http://www.performance.network/)).<br/>You can register for the Honeybee Daylight event by going to this address:\n\n[https://attendee.gototraining.com/r/6086496514016899074](https://attendee.gototraining.com/r/6086496514016899074)\n\nHope to see see you there!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 25, 2015 at 1:09pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "topic": "Honeybee Daylight Workshop / Webinar", "replies": [{"body": "\nGreetings,\u00a0\n\n\n\nHow to watch\u00a0\n\nfrom February 27. ?\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Igor Mitri\u0107 Lavovski", "created_at": "March 31, 2015 at 2:22pm", "created_by": "Igor425", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Igor,\n\nTo be honest, I am not sure if Arpan recorded everything but I will ask him as soon as I can. \u00a0I can say that you can find most of everything that was covered in the workshop between these two youtube playlists:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-Sj_XGz3kzHUoWmpWDX...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-Sj_XGz3kzHUoWmpWDXNep1O)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkjfDmSc5OrzBgdPWQB7rbqFycWp...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkjfDmSc5OrzBgdPWQB7rbqFycWpbxtaN)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 31, 2015 at 5:55pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHi Chris,\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Igor Mitri\u0107 Lavovski", "created_at": "April 1, 2015 at 3:11am", "created_by": "Igor425", "replies": []}], "id": "1250164"}
