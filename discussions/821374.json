But, gencumsky component seem to write error message below on report output out put as image 1 attached.\n\n\n\n**\"gendiscretesky:Error -\u00a0invalid\u00a0input parameter '-p'.\"**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing components also write error message as image 2 attached.\n\n\n\nDose anyone have an idea to solve this problem?\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nMaru\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A821372", "name": "Explain-01.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A821373", "name": "Explain-02.png"}], "created_by_name": "Ryosuke Maruyama", "created_at": "April 1, 2013 at 4:41am", "created_by": "RyosukeMaruyama", "topic": "Where can I download GenCumSky.exe manually??", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Maru,\n\nCheck the attached file and\u00a0let me know how it goes.\n\nYou can also try to change the workingDir to a new location on another drive that you have a higher level of permission (e.g. d:/test) and see if it does solve the security problem.\n\nBest,\n\n-Mostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A821714", "name": "GenCumulativeSky.exe"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 1, 2013 at 8:22am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you for your replay.
