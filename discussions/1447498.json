{"body": "\nI am having trouble finding information on how to go about modeling a basement in honeybee that is only partially below grade. Can someone point me to any examples or tutorials for working with basements in honeybee?\n\n\n\nYou can see the model in the screenshot with a simplified ground plane (there will be retaining walls to manage the grade change). I'd like to be able to include the exposed exterior walls in my outside walls HBobjects so that I can add glazing, etc.\n\n\n\nIt looks like my solution may be to go through and build up my zones surface by surface rather than the quick method?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zANsye7pDaaJcSPY0bZuLrOpK3PCFDi2o8KEpgUPwix8qPk11sF5pSAOQW-uOgdI--TXxL4LcdADC9OYVXDJOnFIl8NosDfq/basement.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zANsye7pDaaJcSPY0bZuLrOpK3PCFDi2o8KEpgUPwix8qPk11sF5pSAOQW-uOgdI--TXxL4LcdADC9OYVXDJOnFIl8NosDfq/basement.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Naryn Davar", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 10:00am", "created_by": "NarynDavar", "topic": "Modeling a walkout basement in honeybee", "replies": [{"body": "\nNaryn, Use CreateHBSrfs and set the EPBC to ground for the surfaces which touches the ground.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 5, 2016 at 10:56pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}], "id": "1447498"}
