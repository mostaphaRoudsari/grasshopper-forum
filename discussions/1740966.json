{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am trying to set up an example model and I notice that falsecolor rendering does not work even though the 3d rendeing is there but the false color lines do not show up. I was able to do the glare analysis. The only problem I have is to run falsecolor. I have attached the .gh model.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1740965", "name": "daylight_submit.gh"}], "created_by_name": "saram", "created_at": "April 27, 2017 at 2:27pm", "created_by": "saram", "topic": "Falsecolor does not work in Ladybug and Honeybee", "replies": [{"body": "\nDo you have falsecolor2.exe in radiance\\bin?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 27, 2017 at 7:26pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nYes, I do have Falsecolor2 and evalglare in c\\radiance\\bin\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "saram", "created_at": "April 28, 2017 at 10:40am", "created_by": "saram", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nIt works fine. You were connecting the image from the run daylight component to the image viewer instead of FalseColor. Also you should not adjust the exposure for a false color image. If you need to do so, do it before generating the false color.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/S6s2Mu0DvER56gd*ofeEPC3M1o99s8Otc5mPuNNI7548VPnz1f9OLRi2gd*44GMDoWVQ7ssxX3HDFE3VVldkfIl48Q6u-u83/falsecolor.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/S6s2Mu0DvER56gd*ofeEPC3M1o99s8Otc5mPuNNI7548VPnz1f9OLRi2gd*44GMDoWVQ7ssxX3HDFE3VVldkfIl48Q6u-u83/falsecolor.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 29, 2017 at 7:12am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks for noticing my mistake.
