Since to be that the last update force that the default is now at the .../Roaming/... location and not also at C:\\Ladybug (as both of them were allowed before). After that it worked fine.\n\nI would check, anyways, also the tolerance of Rhino (mine is 0.001). Not sure this can be, but please check.\n\nIf nothing of this helps, test the component to identify the code line where the error is happenning. This can be helpful for debuging.\n\nAttached the file that i \"touched\".\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1692817", "name": "Rebuilding_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 16, 2017 at 12:27am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you Abraham for looking into this one.\n\n\n\nI expected that this would work on someone else's machine.

I did not fully understand your comment on default folder path. Can you please elaborate on that?
