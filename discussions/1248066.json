{"body": "\nHi,everyone\n\nI was trying to\u00a0set the floor constructions with honeybee. but it is always show interior floor.

The HB_setEPZoneCnstr component don't allow to change ground floor construction, but only exterior floor (See attached, white group at the bottom). In the zone definition process the surface was defined as an interior floor (didn't find how to change this in the way you defined the zone).\n\nI defined the zone differently (based on surfaces) and there i could change the surface type and the construction (see white group at the top of the file).\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1248225", "name": "test_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 23, 2015 at 2:18am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nUpdated version of the file.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1248084", "name": "test_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 23, 2015 at 3:03am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "rendy perdana khidmat", "created_at": "March 23, 2015 at 4:22am", "created_by": "rendyperdanakhidmat", "replies": [{"body": "\nRendy,\n\nTo change the construction of a ground floor, you should use the \"Set EP Zone Ground Construction\" component.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5W1fGMD3XQTTFYD*U0pgVX1IeEhqUvkNzSVYmY0pT*l91ia2lNV4SRjnkbtW1cIrZqFmgUk5Qqnqm*PHtVrmU9UhY*K49EPz/SetEPGrndConstr.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5W1fGMD3XQTTFYD*U0pgVX1IeEhqUvkNzSVYmY0pT*l91ia2lNV4SRjnkbtW1cIrZqFmgUk5Qqnqm*PHtVrmU9UhY*K49EPz/SetEPGrndConstr.PNG)\n\nAbraham's method is also good and thank you for posting it, Abraham. \u00a0I think this alternative one should be a bit better in that it requires fewer components and is more manageable in cases of a large number of zones.\n\nSee updated GH file attached.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1253679", "name": "test_AY_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 31, 2015 at 5:08pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}]}
