{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nthank you for this great tool. :)<br/>I have a question concerning view dependant legends.<br/>I see that legends are placed with a reference point in 2d-space.\n\nAnd I found the quite interesting module orienttocam which can be used for text.<br/>Sadly, both cannot be connected in a proper way when operating in 3dspace trying to place a legend for an animated sequence.\n\nIs there a workaround to accomplish something similar?<br/><br/>Kind regards,\n\nAnte\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ante Ljubas", "created_at": "February 23, 2014 at 1:18pm", "created_by": "AnteLjubas", "topic": "View Dependant Legend", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ante,\n\n\n\nThanks. The ideal solution is to develop a component that generates the legend as a graphic (and not a geometry). I tried it a number of times and it is not that hard to create the legend however it is really hard to dispose! You can easily end up having the legend up there with no way to remove it. This is something that I can give it another try later but I hope someone else does it before me! ;)\n\n\n\nThe current workaround is to find coordinate of a Point2D on the screen and then use that as the legend basepoint. It will work as far as you animate in a single viewport. Attached is a quick and dirty example. It should work as far as you are creating gentle camera moves!\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1014218", "name": "reMaplegendBasePt.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 23, 2014 at 3:01pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,<br/><br/>thank you for the example. :)<br/>As far as I could understand the procedure, the legend parameters are handed through to the re-color mesh component.
