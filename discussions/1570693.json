Now i get an error saying the schedule i use for the window's blinds is not in the HB schedule library. Also some fields in the people section are missing (i'm using defaults according to chosen activity).\n\nProbably i'm doing something wrong here, but maybe ... i'm not :-) since the HB_runEnergySimulation runs fine in the same file.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 24, 2016 at 9:09pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nAbraham,\n\n\n\nThanks for all of the information. \u00a0Two of the issues were bugs, which have now been fixed, and one of the issues was the result of an error on your part (I think).\n\n\n\nOne bug resulted from me not realizing that emissivity is an optional input for E+ opaque materials. \u00a0Another bug was because I did not include the whole csv file name in the schedule assigned by the shade generator. \u00a0I have been using Antonello's new 'Annual Schedule' component, which makes schedule creation very easy and allows us to write schedules into the .OSM (not just the .IDF) using the day-week-year IDF format. \u00a0As a result, I failed to notice this bug on the CSV component until you pointed it out.\n\n\n\nBoth bugs are fixed in the attached gh file and [on the github](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/5e3e8185258ec63d7199f8a631d2055e384b19b6).\n\n\n\nFinally, the issue with the 'activity schedule' is that you connected a CSV schedule that is 'Fractional' to an input that requires you to specify the unit as 'ActivityLevel' (and, accordingly, schedule values in Watts). \u00a0You can either change the units on the CSV component to be\u00a0'ActivityLevel' or (what I think you meant to do) connect your schedule to 'occupancySchedules_' instead of 'occupancyActivitySchs_'.\n\n\n\nThanks again!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1570936", "name": "07_E_Simulation_Surface_by_surface_InternalisedBlindsLoads_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 24, 2016 at 11:05pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris Thanks for taking care and sorry for the late response.
