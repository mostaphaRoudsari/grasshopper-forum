Alternatively you could show us where to add the additional strings we need inside the runEnergySimulation command so that we can add the values we need to run the simulation.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor clarity, these are the internal gains in idf file we need (that are inside de gh file in the panel just below the additional strings command)\n\nLights,<br/>, !- Name<br/>, !- Zone or ZoneList Name<br/>, !- Schedule Name<br/> Watts/Person, !- Design Level Calculation Method<br/> , !- Lighting Level {W}<br/> , !- Watts per Zone Floor Area {W/m2}<br/> 16, !- Watts per Person {W/person}<br/> 0.2, !- Return Air Fraction<br/> 0.59, !- Fraction Radiant<br/> 0.2, !- Fraction Visible<br/> 0, !- Fraction Replaceable<br/> GeneralLights; !- End-Use Subcategory\n\nPeople,<br/>, !- Name<br/>, !- Zone or ZoneList Name<br/>, !- Number of People Schedule Name<br/> People, !- Number of People Calculation Method<br/> 4, !- Number of People<br/> , !- People per Zone Floor Area {person/m2}<br/> , !- Zone Floor Area per Person {m2/person}<br/> 0.3, !- Fraction Radiant<br/> , !- Sensible Heat Fraction<br/> attivit\u00e0 metabolica, !- Activity Level Schedule Name<br/> 0.0000000382, !- Carbon Dioxide Generation Rate {m3/s-W}<br/> , !- Enable ASHRAE 55 Comfort Warnings<br/> ZoneAveraged, !- Mean Radiant Temperature Calculation Type<br/> , !- Surface Name/Angle Factor List Name<br/>, !- Work Efficiency Schedule Name<br/> ClothingInsulationSchedule, !- Clothing Insulation Calculation Method<br/> , !- Clothing Insulation Calculation Method Schedule Name<br/>, !- Clothing Insulation Schedule Name<br/>, !- Air Velocity Schedule Name<br/> AdaptiveCEN15251; !- Thermal Comfort Model 1 Type\n\nElectricEquipment,<br/>, !- Name<br/>, !- Zone or ZoneList Name<br/>, !- Schedule Name<br/> Watts/Area, !- Design Level Calculation Method<br/> , !- Design Level {W}<br/> 5, !- Watts per Zone Floor Area {W/m2}<br/> , !- Watts per Person {W/person}<br/> 0, !- Fraction Latent<br/> 0.3, !- Fraction Radiant<br/> 0, !- Fraction Lost<br/> General; !- End-Use Subcategory\n\n\n\nThank you very much!<br/>Filippo\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1287589", "name": "userCustomEPLibrary.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1287590", "name": "HB_TEST_1505.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Filippo", "created_at": "May 15, 2015 at 11:52am", "created_by": "Filippo", "topic": "Internal Gains editing in Honeybee", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Filippo,\n\n\n\nDo you still need help with this or is it already solved?\n\n\n\nWhen I was putting default values for people inside the component I had the wrong assumption that nobody would ever need to change this one and you and\u00a0Letizia proofed me wrong.
