I hope you find it helpful.\n\n[http://patternguide.advancedbuildings.net/using-this-guide/analysis...](http://patternguide.advancedbuildings.net/using-this-guide/analysis-methods)\n\n\u00a0\n\nDaylight Autonomy requires a target light level, which is commonly set at 300 lux. However, different space types require different light levels. The IESNA handbook offers light level targets for various commercial space types. For example, corridors only need 50-100 lux, while workspaces need 300-500 depending on the task and building type.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor residential space types, exact light levels may not be as important as ensuring that the space\u00a0**feels** well daylit. To make the space feel well lit, I would recommend at least 500 lux even though this is far more light than your electric lighting system will need to provide. Access to outside views and ensuring\u00a0high brightness on vertical surfaces helps make a space feel brighter as well.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "November 12, 2015 at 12:29pm", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks a lot Leland\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "sajad shahin", "created_at": "November 13, 2015 at 3:07am", "created_by": "sajadshahin", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1399260"}
