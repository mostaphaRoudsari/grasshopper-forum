{"body": "\nHi, does anyone know how to solve this problem?\n\nI have recently downloaded Honeybee but I'm unable to use it. There's always the error message: You should first let Honeybee fly. I have tried re-downloading all the necessary programs such as Radiance, Daysim, Openstudio and Energyplus, but am still unable to get Honeybee to run. Could anyone suggest any ways which I can solve this problem? I'd appreciate that a lot!\n\nAttached is the screenshot showing the error message.\n\n[Screenshot%202017-02-05%2009.01.54.png](http://api.ning.com/files/*ix1zXEQDKMgqtB0dQl2kU-SbS3JzHoogwWYG2JNEE6KHO55T9OsC4CM3v9AG2LlSDdHVLyi8ik5LYGF3CdNI3zRhoyFiuRN/Screenshot2017020509.01.54.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers, Nicole\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nicole Chung", "created_at": "February 4, 2017 at 6:21pm", "created_by": "NicoleChung", "topic": "HB error- You should first let Honeybee fly", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Nicole,\n\n1.
