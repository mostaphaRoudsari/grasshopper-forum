Meanwhile I give it a try.\n\n\n\n1. Are you talking about the Grasshopper definition? If so that's optional. You can choose any other day that you want.\n\n2. That is again to show how you can use conditional statement to filter sun positions. You can remove it from your file.\n\n3. As far as I can see it's because your base curve is located underground.\n\n\n\nIf you still have questions please also share the grasshopper definition.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 23, 2015 at 8:51am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor Q 1/2.

If you see the whole south (from SE to SW) is free of obstructions. The lower mesh you get is telling you that your solar elements can be installed at those low heights without being affected by the surroundings. The default low value is -20 m, which is the lower mesh you get. You can input less than that (i did -50) and still get the possibility of having the solar collectors very low.\n\nIf you want to test what i'm saying just put some buildings at the south and you'll see that the solar collection mesh will rise. At an ideal situation you want it as lower as possible. In this way you are granted to receive sun at your plot, since the neighbors are not blocking it from you.\n\nAs for the solar envelope something similar but opposite is happening. Your context is pretty much away so you can build high. The default height is 50. You can give a higher number and you'll see that.\n\nHope this is clear.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 27, 2015 at 9:14pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nDear Abraham,\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply.
