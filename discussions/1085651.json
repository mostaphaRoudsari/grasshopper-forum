Giving a low window height will do the trick (i believe).

The newest version of addGlazing (which you can download from github or find in the attached file) has a toggle for keeping the window as a single window. If this is still not what you are looking for then you can create the glazing as a separate geometry.\n\n\n\n2. You can just use the schedule component to create the new schedule.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SRbpV0Al75qXxMdNcVSkWUdp0QzvdsgQjuoMJstny0QNGqx-OizcZfMfegYwdr9WHlqVp-RA-SrQYZoQJmRPpzhezrCjZ4zB/addGlazing_Schedule.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SRbpV0Al75qXxMdNcVSkWUdp0QzvdsgQjuoMJstny0QNGqx-OizcZfMfegYwdr9WHlqVp-RA-SrQYZoQJmRPpzhezrCjZ4zB/addGlazing_Schedule.png)\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1085837", "name": "addGlazing_and_Schedule.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 9, 2014 at 5:52pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nMustapha,\n\nThat's exactly what I'm looking for. again you have saved my day\n\nThank you very much\u00a0\n\n\n\nClaudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "June 9, 2014 at 6:20pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHello Mostapha.
