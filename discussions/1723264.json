{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI am currently trying to receive the maximum luminance values from falsecolour images in a number format. I know how to get the extrema printed on the falsecolor image, however I will have to analyze a high number of images, so manually typing them is not a solution for me.\n\nIs there a command or a component where I can get the maximum luminance value for an image?\n\nBest regards,\n\nFlorian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Florian Wochele", "created_at": "March 29, 2017 at 6:04am", "created_by": "FlorianWochele", "topic": "Maximum luminance as number output from falsecolor image", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Florian,\n\nDo you have all the HDR images in the same folder? As Rob already answered in radiance mailing list you can use radiance pextrem command ([http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/pextrem.1.html](http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/pextrem.1.html)) to get the location and the value. Then you need to parse the output to get the max value and then store it in a text file. We don't have a component but this is an easy enough task to do if you know a little bit of scripting.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 29, 2017 at 9:35am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}
