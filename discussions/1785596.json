{"body": "\nHello\n\n\n\nI am having a problem running honeybee and I see an Runtime Error; Win32Exception.\n\nThe problem started when I uninstalled HB/LB and reinstalled the new version, and now I am getting the error.\u00a0\n\nFrom Radaince, Eplus and OpenStudio, I ONLY re-installed OSM again to save it in C:\\program files rather than the automatic location that it selects. My radiance and Eplus are the same old ones.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy radiance is located in C:\\radiance\n\nOpenStudio is in in C:\\program files\\Open studio\n\nEnergyPlus is in C:\\EnergyPlus V8.5\n\n\n\nI read a previous post about this error but that did not solve my issue.\u00a0\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/honeybee-ru...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/honeybee-runtime-error-win32exception?xg_source=activity)\n\n\n\nIn another example file from Hydra, when I connected a panel to my Honeybee component, \u00a0I saw:\n\nFailed to sort OpenStudio installation folders. I don't know if that is the same problem or not.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWould you please tell me what could be causing this error?\u00a0\n\nI appreciate your help.\n\nLadan\n\nAttachments:\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1785594", "name": "Win32.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1785595", "name": "Win32-2.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "July 18, 2017 at 1:56pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "Honeybee Runtime Error: Win32Exception", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ladan,\n\n\n\nDid you check c:\\ladybug folder?

I do see C:\\ladybug on my computer.\n\nI feel that it is because of my OpenStudio or EnergyPlus because I can see daylighting results but not energy simulations.\n\nI read on other discussions that OpenStudio should be in C:|program files and since it automatically wants to be located on C:\\OpenStudio, I created a folder myself in C:\\program files and called it OpenStudio and saved the openstudio documents there while installing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn regards Eplus, I have had all versions including V-8.3 and V-8.5 before re-installing LB+HB. HB picks V-8.3 automatically. I don't know if that could be a problem too.\u00a0\n\nPlease help me to get these bugs fly again!\u00a0\n\nThanks\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "on Wednesday", "created_by": "LillyGD", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Ladan,\n\n\n\nCan you please try C:\\EnergyPlusV#### and C:\\openstudio-###?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "on Wednesday", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nFollowing are directories on my machine.
