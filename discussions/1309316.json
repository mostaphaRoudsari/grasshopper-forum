Solution exception:'Brep' object has no attribute 'upper'\").\n\nYou gave me a hint about the possibility that the names are the cause of the problem. So i connected a HB_LabelSurfaces component to check that. The component became red at the final zone level definition. So i started to connect it to each zone in order to identify the one(s) that are making trouble. The one is the NorthEast. After checking different possibilities i solved it changing the tolerance in Rhino to 0.001, and disabling/enabling all zones (see blue arrows). That solved the problem (!!). See in the attached the big red arrow and comments for more information.\n\nAfter that everything is almost working fine.\n\nI disabled the context geometry which is making the simulation time to be so high. So you need to enable it.\n\nThat's it. Besides the HB_srfDataByTypeDetailed everything is working well. I flattened the data input. But the results you get are only for the airwalls. So don't know what to suggest here.\n\n\n\nRegarding the update question. See the top left corner, yellow group. You need to toggle those elements to true. This should do the work most of the times. But it happens that some components change the number of input/output items or their names. For those cases you need to reinsert them.
