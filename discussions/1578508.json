You can locate the text from the pts file that Honeybee generates, assign a directional vector based on the view specification and assign color as per the illuminance value. (This is most likely what they did above anyway...)\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe other approach is to generate an equally sized jpg/bmp/tiff with numbers alone, then do a reverse conversion to HDR and finally combine the two images with pcomb.\n\n\n\nI just don't think it is worth the effort as even in the image above, the numbers in the end are completely obscured. I prefer the mesh thingy that we already have :)\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "August 8, 2016 at 4:07pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Sarith\n\n\n\nThanks for your helpful reply, you are right you can indeed assign the text values in radiance however Im not sure how to do a reverse conversion to HRD and combine to a Pcomb do you have an example of this?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "August 15, 2016 at 8:38am", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\n\n\nHere is a quick and dirty example..\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/j5BEQWmInn2EFV1Jh7p6taGAN4io6lKUAxwdQetaX-bKuRZyhDeBAawvyW9VXW3Aey2iZltDZMf-TvcU9*VBxTwbpnQII*nR/1.bmp?width=400\" width=\"400\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/j5BEQWmInn2EFV1Jh7p6taGAN4io6lKUAxwdQetaX-bKuRZyhDeBAawvyW9VXW3Aey2iZltDZMf-TvcU9*VBxTwbpnQII*nR/1.bmp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/j5BEQWmInn0FKXzVniAT8y8oK6aQOQe69*exoqyvVqPlh0hNrBG7H65DquJvouvZ*Q*T1BoF8-5zb6zMviqyiI3TD-YuoSNz/2.bmp?width=400\" width=\"400\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/j5BEQWmInn0FKXzVniAT8y8oK6aQOQe69*exoqyvVqPlh0hNrBG7H65DquJvouvZ*Q*T1BoF8-5zb6zMviqyiI3TD-YuoSNz/2.bmp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/j5BEQWmInn2u2yiXsbIAb0*FZgjkOwfvb9ruzT*AJqbgvaDTPFB6i88qtX8cF2hSAO2tNln00f9mGFiyksmBBxnjRbljDSU1/res.bmp?width=400\" width=\"400\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/j5BEQWmInn2u2yiXsbIAb0*FZgjkOwfvb9ruzT*AJqbgvaDTPFB6i88qtX8cF2hSAO2tNln00f9mGFiyksmBBxnjRbljDSU1/res.bmp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/j5BEQWmInn2e9-QWfYmZxdt4Fml3QS8Er9oRc3nYI-vAufBw7l0I2xd8*NAYG1qME8G-QWDPeyGTItuqnyKq-QIBTwaK3bfu/8162016121103AM.bmp\" width=\"586\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/j5BEQWmInn2e9-QWfYmZxdt4Fml3QS8Er9oRc3nYI-vAufBw7l0I2xd8*NAYG1qME8G-QWDPeyGTItuqnyKq-QIBTwaK3bfu/8162016121103AM.bmp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe files are attached.
