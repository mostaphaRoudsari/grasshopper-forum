Usually it doesn't work with very old versions of Ladybug. With your current version should be fine.\n\n\n\nComing back to your issue, your file works fine. Probably, you have an issue with\u00a0Ladybug_GenCumulativeSkyMtx.\n\nI think you have an issue like this:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/cumulatives...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/cumulativeskymtx-error)\n\nSo, try to connect panels in this way:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/nhHDy1eLksUi5uP8MPb5qvs*9a5efYhuK4XGj*cCXvMDZJd3*uFg*R07p1kZsdEg-QjkgboRRO-RN0FUH24NwzZGl6jS4Tel/test_panels.png?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nhHDy1eLksUi5uP8MPb5qvs*9a5efYhuK4XGj*cCXvMDZJd3*uFg*R07p1kZsdEg-QjkgboRRO-RN0FUH24NwzZGl6jS4Tel/test_panels.png)\n\nlet me know what does it say.\n\n\n\nBest\n\nAntonello\n\n\n\nP.S. When your issue will be solved, I suggest you study this example here:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;amp...;](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Real-time_Radiation_Analysis_with_Ladybug&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\nI think your grid size is too large.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "March 24, 2016 at 4:19am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks !!
