{"body": "\nHello Djordje and all,\n\nI'm playing with your Ladybug Photovoltaics Surface component. It's very clean--nice work! It seems there might be something awry in the scaling of the output: I'm modeling a 4000sf system (~380m2) and it's reporting a nominal system size of 0.6kW, though I would expect more like 60kW. For reference, through the pvwatts web interface, the default size (4kW) is explained as roughly a 25m2 system. I suspect this has to do with my rhino model being in units=feet, and I've looked into the code a bit; could there be a bug in the use of the\u00a0unitAreaConversionFactor?\u00a0\n\n\n\nHere's a screenshot of my output, if it helps to explain what I'm looking at:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UNsexXQ7LVk3*QMWVggryHjtkRTQEMvsrjJbFDh*tPF2Ks6xpRCvAcKERm11AyZV6FUIxrrhQCoCguJFNojoV2BX3qX6OkR2/Clipboard01.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UNsexXQ7LVk3*QMWVggryHjtkRTQEMvsrjJbFDh*tPF2Ks6xpRCvAcKERm11AyZV6FUIxrrhQCoCguJFNojoV2BX3qX6OkR2/Clipboard01.jpg)\n\n\n\nThanks for your thoughts!\n\n-Nick\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Novelli", "created_at": "May 12, 2016 at 10:22am", "created_by": "NickNovelli", "topic": "System size scaling in LB photovoltaics?", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Nick,<br/><br/>From your screenshot I can see that you are having an issue with a vertical PVsurface (tilt angle equals 90 degrees). This was a [bug and it has been fixed](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/xn/detail/2985220:Comment:1482064). To benefit from this fix, your Ladybug_ladybug component must be equal or newer than 11th of March 2016. (Ladybug version 0.0.62). Download the [newest one from here](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/userObjects/Ladybug_Ladybug.ghuser).<br/><br/>As for the issue you're having with the final output, would you be so kind to attach both your .gh and .3dm files please?
