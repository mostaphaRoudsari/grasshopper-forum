{"body": "\nHello guys,\n\nWhile running a simple energy simulation following the tutorials from Youtube so\n\nfar I have found 2 issues:\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. 1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> \u00a0\n\n\u00a0** Severe\u00a0 ** Problem in interior solar distribution calculation (CHKBKS)\n\n\n\nThat happened after running the energy simulation. I will attach the file and image I\u00b4m working with since maybe the geometry could be the problem. (Attached image)\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. Trying to visualize EP results in colored surfaces and one of my BREPS is ignored\n\n(Attached image)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/p9ey71ICjWcNk*elnzgUIbK2A0En-bGgRtjY9RQdHLddzLoXFnBq6gBEsfYV2RJLX-0B*prOnPCzr3q10UDfxF8wgMxQosg6/ignoredbrep.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/p9ey71ICjWcNk*elnzgUIbK2A0En-bGgRtjY9RQdHLddzLoXFnBq6gBEsfYV2RJLX-0B*prOnPCzr3q10UDfxF8wgMxQosg6/ignoredbrep.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1461661", "name": "simple_ext.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1461662", "name": "simple_exp100216.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Luis E.
