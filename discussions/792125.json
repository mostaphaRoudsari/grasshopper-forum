{"body": "\nI recently received multiple questions about the orientation study and I hope this discussion answers the majority of them.\n\n\n\n**WHAT + WHEN?**\n\nOrientation study is a feature integrated to the analysis components (radiation, sunlight-hours and view analysis) which let you study the effect of the orientation of your building and the analysis result. When you come to a question similar to **\"what is the orientation that the building receives the most/least amount of radiation?\"** is probably the right time to use this component.\n\n\n\n**HOW?**\n\nI'll try to explain the steps using a simple example. Here is my design geometries. The building in the center is the building to be designed and the rest of the buildings are context. I want to see the effect of orientation on the amount of the radiation on the test building surfaces from the start of Oct. to the end of Feb. for Chicago.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0kgYed5*J8MQiBB1Jfp7FV9WklKOFl0u2JbESpr8UytFW*MTEWT1K6n0nwy6UlgviP36i62fewRYcstLUTQXgiPEUeENMWA1/orientationStudy_testGeometries.jpg?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0kgYed5*J8MQiBB1Jfp7FV9WklKOFl0u2JbESpr8UytFW*MTEWT1K6n0nwy6UlgviP36i62fewRYcstLUTQXgiPEUeENMWA1/orientationStudy_testGeometries.jpg)\n\nFirst I need to set up the normal radiation analysis and run it for the building as it is right now. [I'm not going to explain how you can set up this since you can find it in the sample file (**[Download the sample file from here](https://www.box.com/s/06t7b2yfhg0gjhedybbj)**)]\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0kgYed5*J8MkYDPaCkKGrmGxXVaZmKg5W4QW6*ct22XnWm*U0bAJO*iaLuoJQ7g0-ks4Jeu6Ib7X5tJI20LQL5r6vVw16MRx/orientationStudy_radiationTest.jpg?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0kgYed5*J8MkYDPaCkKGrmGxXVaZmKg5W4QW6*ct22XnWm*U0bAJO*iaLuoJQ7g0-ks4Jeu6Ib7X5tJI20LQL5r6vVw16MRx/orientationStudy_radiationTest.jpg)\n\nNow I need to set up the parameters for orientation study using orientationStudyPar component. You can find it under the Extra tab:\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0kgYed5*J8MuerZ4M662iD5qzqK2Xozn7CRPerwEvxFJMZbIAr5lmjKjwLHZkPujqs8IZx-hgoMK5KoNeZh5lGb0HJyNbxc6/orientationStudy_Parameters.jpg?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0kgYed5*J8MuerZ4M662iD5qzqK2Xozn7CRPerwEvxFJMZbIAr5lmjKjwLHZkPujqs8IZx-hgoMK5KoNeZh5lGb0HJyNbxc6/orientationStudy_Parameters.jpg)\n\nAt minimum I need to input the divisionAngle, and the totalAngle and set runTheStudy to True. In this case I put 45 for divisionAngle and 180 for the totalAngle which means I want the study to be run for angles 0, 45, 90, 135 and 180.\n\n[Note1: The divisionAngle should be divisible by totalAngle.]\n\n[Note 2: If you don't provide any point for the basePoint, the component will use the center of the geometry as the center of the rotation.]\n\n[Note 3: You can also rotate the context with the geometry! Normally you don't have the chance to change the context to make your design work but if you got lucky the rotateContext input is for you! Set it to True. The default is set to False.]\n\n\n\nYou're all set for the orientation study, just connect the orientationStudyPar output to OrientationStudyP input in the component and wait for the result!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0kgYed5*J8MgWI7uJLTHhY*sio14uGXLKdMyL15mklLC30X8C*VZnGU41pVc4RE8tQjjoHb-TnYdU8xkd-tXfQBYoZ7MDcHd/orientationStudy_ConnectTheWires.jpg?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0kgYed5*J8MgWI7uJLTHhY*sio14uGXLKdMyL15mklLC30X8C*VZnGU41pVc4RE8tQjjoHb-TnYdU8xkd-tXfQBYoZ7MDcHd/orientationStudy_ConnectTheWires.jpg)\n\n\n\nThe component will run the study for all the orientations and preview the latest geometry. To see the result just grab a quick graph and connect it to totalRadiation. As you can see in the graph 135 is the orientation that I receive the maximum radiation. Dang!\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0kgYed5*J8N3QD9ha*RvK-qbdT7H2YmdCytA5flyKkv2eRRS1qpAb-jYqUZ9BHdCRJymBD4hnQF29DjetKA5bKJ9LhJ3MrgR/orientationStudyResults.jpg?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0kgYed5*J8N3QD9ha*RvK-qbdT7H2YmdCytA5flyKkv2eRRS1qpAb-jYqUZ9BHdCRJymBD4hnQF29DjetKA5bKJ9LhJ3MrgR/orientationStudyResults.jpg)\n\nIf you want to see all the result geometries set bakeIt to True, and the result will be baked under LadyBug&gt; RadaitionStudy&gt;[projectname]&gt;\u00a0 . The layer name starts with a number which is the totalRadiation.<br/>\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0kgYed5*J8MiFW2v44LFpGNhHe9pjL2*3BvXL1WEy2K*lct*kjUAq026I*2E0Ccq5*KBub5P3iN7RUwShDkv-p*Lma9Ve8wl/orientationStudy_layers.jpg?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0kgYed5*J8MiFW2v44LFpGNhHe9pjL2*3BvXL1WEy2K*lct*kjUAq026I*2E0Ccq5*KBub5P3iN7RUwShDkv-p*Lma9Ve8wl/orientationStudy_layers.jpg)\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A792124", "name": "orientationStudy_SampleFile.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 17, 2013 at 3:31pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "topic": "Orientation Study", "replies": [{"body": "\n[<img class=\"align-right\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3Gs40plUa2Mjcp9KSw6cKZPa2gbu-HnxAmOihfbkI833IxSIXrjWW8954q6zTy8PIrGMMwOd-KAqv1wPglxMvJ83KTV2wKbB/Untitled1.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3Gs40plUa2Mjcp9KSw6cKZPa2gbu-HnxAmOihfbkI833IxSIXrjWW8954q6zTy8PIrGMMwOd-KAqv1wPglxMvJ83KTV2wKbB/Untitled1.jpg)\n\nHi\u00a0\n\n[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3Gs40plUa2Mjcp9KSw6cKZPa2gbu-HnxAmOihfbkI833IxSIXrjWW8954q6zTy8PIrGMMwOd-KAqv1wPglxMvJ83KTV2wKbB/Untitled1.jpg)\n\nI'm new using Ladybug, i just download the orientation study sample file and i get the following bug, not\u00a0sure\u00a0if this is because i'm\u00a0using\u00a0the\u00a0password\u00a0protected version or a win 8 problem, any thoughts? thanks its a really\u00a0powerful\u00a0friend this ladybug\n\n[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3Gs40plUa2Mjcp9KSw6cKZPa2gbu-HnxAmOihfbkI833IxSIXrjWW8954q6zTy8PIrGMMwOd-KAqv1wPglxMvJ83KTV2wKbB/Untitled1.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jose Miguel Armijo", "created_at": "May 2, 2013 at 1:06pm", "created_by": "JoseMiguelArmijo", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Jose,\n\nWelcome to the camp! ;)\n\nLocked version and unlocked version are the same code.
