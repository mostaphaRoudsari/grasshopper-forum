{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nI have been looking at the Honeybee microclimate maps to evaluate external thermal comfort in Dubai. I was looking at the MRT results for shaded and non shaded areas and it seems that we have a difference of \u00a050\u00b0C between shaded and exposed areas. Moreover, MRT goes as high as 110\u00b0C in exposed aeras, does that seem plausible? Is anyone aware of measuring campaign in those areas?\n\nAttached is a benchmark script.\n\nThanks for your help,\n\n- Nicolas\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1703111", "name": "MRT benchmark.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1703112", "name": "2017-03-01 11_29_51-Untitled - Rhinoceros 5.0 Commercial - [Top].png"}], "created_by_name": "Nicolas Chaulet", "created_at": "March 1, 2017 at 4:30am", "created_by": "NicolasChaulet", "topic": "MRT in hot climate", "replies": [{"body": "\nNicolas,\n\nSorry for the incredibly late reply. \u00a0What you are seeing is true but it is important to keep in mind that MRT is a theoretical concept and not the actual temperature of a material. \u00a0Only half of the heat transfer of a given surface is radiant and the convective heat transfer picks up a lot when MRT is this high. \u00a0So no material ever gets that close to the boiling point of water.\n\nStill, if you need an image of something really hot to justify these numbers, temperatures as high as what you are seeing there are probably enough to melt asphalt or at least fry an egg on the pavement. \u00a0The sun is very powerful, particularly when you're observing it at the right time.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 6, 2017 at 5:24am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}
