{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am trying to do a\u00a0Cumulative Radiation Analysis study of a landscape.\n\nI have tried using\u00a0mostaphaRoudsari's script from Hydrashare, however having some troubles getting it to work.\u00a0\n\n1. When I run the script even with a large grid size (that I understand speeds up the run time) it still freezes for 20mins and forces me to restart my machine.\n\n2. If i connect a point component to testpts to see the test sampling, the points are not visible.\n\nMaybe I am missing something, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTest files attached. (rhino file too big to upload) site is\u00a01639073 x\u00a01243694 mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1460481", "name": "Cumulative_Radiation_Analysis_Edited.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Paddyf123", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 2:42am", "created_by": "PADDYFernandez", "topic": "Cumulative Radiation Analysis from large landscape", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi\n\n\n\nSo I ran your script and it works fine for me. It is probably an issue with genCumulativeSkyMtx. Are you running it on your own machine? You may want to define the workingDir and LadyBug_Ladybug defaultFolder if you are having access rights issues.\n\n\n\nDo you get any error message?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nDuncan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 10:17am", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "replies": [{"body": "\n1.
