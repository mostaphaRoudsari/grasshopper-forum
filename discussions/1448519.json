{"body": "\nHello all,\u00a0\n\nHas anyone else had trouble recently using the Ladybug Legend Parameters component with the SkyDome component? I was using them through mid-December, then at the end of that month I updated some components, and it hasn't worked since. There was a version mismatch, but all my components are currently at v0.61, and they are still not working together (tho the sky dome works with default legend parameter settings).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Novelli", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 2:03pm", "created_by": "NickNovelli", "topic": "recent LegendParameters bug?", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Nick,\n\nI just uploaded the new version to Food4Rhino.
