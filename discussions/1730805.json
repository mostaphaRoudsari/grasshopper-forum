{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\n\nI'm having a bit of trouble figuring out the right approach for something..\u00a0\n\nI'd like to model a wall which has pipes embedded in the walls acting as heat exchangers throughout the day. I'd like to optimize the size of pipe, number of pipes, location etc etc using software like Therm which outputes a heat map.\n\n\n\nThing is, I'm having difficulty linking this up to Galapagos/Octopus since each run of analysis requires you to open up Therm Seperately, run an analysis and re-import it into GH.\u00a0\n\n\n\n... Any Suggestions how to go about this? Is there a way to perform the analysis entire through grasshopper so it can be easily linked to Galapagos etc.?\n\n\n\nthanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris bc", "created_at": "April 10, 2017 at 2:03pm", "created_by": "Chrisbc", "topic": "Thermal Wall Optimization", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nExcellent question. \u00a0We have historically not been able to run THERM directly from Grasshopper because the Command Line Interface (CLI) version of THERM has not been free. \u00a0However, the wonderful scientists at LBNL have changed this policy with the release of [THERM 7.5](https://windows.lbl.gov/software/therm/7/index_7_5_9.html)\u00a0and it seems they are gradually working towards an eventual open source version of the software.\n\nI have had the implementation of the THERM CLI in Honeybee\u00a0[on my agenda for a few months now](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/issues/618)\u00a0and you have given me a good reason to get it done. \u00a0I will try to implement this soon and I will post back here once it is ready. \u00a0Once this is in place, you will be able to parametrically generate THERM files and automatically run them through THERM to get the results.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 11, 2017 at 9:26pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi!
