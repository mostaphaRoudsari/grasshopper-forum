{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI'm struggling with the Honeybee_False Color component, see the attached definition. I've tried everything I know - updated ladybug and honeybee, checked to make sure falsecolor2 and evalglare are located under my c:/radiance/bin folder - and the component appears to be working and is not giving me any errors but is not producing an image in the file path location... Any ideas?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1779187", "name": "HDR_FalseColor.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Heather Jauregui", "created_at": "July 5, 2017 at 4:03pm", "created_by": "HeatherJauregui", "topic": "False Color not generating an image", "replies": [{"body": "\nHeather,\n\n\n\nWe need you to upload the starting HDR image that is going into the component in order to be able to run your GH file correctly.\n\nEverything looks like it should work in your file, though. \u00a0Are you saying that the component is outputting a file path but you don't see any falsecolor HDR image at that file path?\n\n\n\nAlso, it might be worth checking this example file that makes use of falsecolor:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;amp...;](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Glare_Analysis&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 6, 2017 at 5:10am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks!
