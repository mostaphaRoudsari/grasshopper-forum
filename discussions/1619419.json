{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI know that this is something that the new version of the Ladybug Analysis Tools API is going to handle but I was wondering if there is anything that can be done till then.\n\n\n\nThe idea is to have a way to use OS measures for the creation of quick reports (and perhaps certification templates) out of our models directly in GH. I have to admit I am not entirely sure if this isn't already available in HB. I am guessing it is possible to currently export the .osm, run the measure and get the report, but it would be cool to do it within GH especially with the visualization capabilities in GH/LB/HB.\n\n\n\nAnyways, just dropping the idea of a post-processing tab/component that can use these and new OS measures to play with simulation outputs. See what people think.\n\n\n\nP.S.: The current list can be found here I believe [https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site/?f](https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site/?f)[0]=bundle%3Anrel_measure&amp;f[1]=im_field_measure_tags%3A959\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "October 16, 2016 at 1:59am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "OpenStudio Measures: Reports", "replies": [{"body": "\nI guess we can extract the data required for the reports using the RDD component. Next week I am hoping to re-focus on energy simulations and I will try and do that using the current standard LEED report from other software as a guide. I could then possibly reproduce this by using the same list of simulation outputs each time.\n\n\n\nOf course, between numerical data outputs and a report there is some distance. That's where an OS measure would come in handy. I guess, after following Chris's amazing webinars I know how easy\u00a0 it is to just open the HB model in Openstudio and run the measure. I can do that for now with no problem, but I'm partial to LB/HB so it would be cool to have it as a feature.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "October 16, 2016 at 3:00am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\nIf you check under WIP tab in Honeybee there are two components that let\u00a0you load OpenStudio Measures and apply them to your case.
