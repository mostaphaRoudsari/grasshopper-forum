{"body": "\nHello everybody,\u00a0\n\nI am running lately some studies about external glare/veiling Glare.\n\nI found really difficult to play with Radiance glass material because cannot input a \u00a0selectivity to it. how can I sort out this problem?\n\nI used 2 different glass transmittance and i get higher luminance value on the external facade for the glass with higher transmittance, which does not make much sense to me.\n\nAny hint on that?\n\nI added a picture as well to show which is the effect that i am looking to replicate.\n\nThanks!\n\nAmedeo\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1254317", "name": "photo.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1254318", "name": "GlassTramittance0.8.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1254319", "name": "Glasstrasmittance0.6.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "amedeo scofone", "created_at": "April 1, 2015 at 5:26am", "created_by": "amedeoscofone", "topic": "Reflective Glass in Radiance", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Amadeo\n\nI'm not an expert on this but from what I understand reflections on glass are very dependent on context. In your case the images out of Radiance has no context what so ever so it s normal that no reflection is displayed by the software. Perhaps you could model some context bldgs. as well as some interior geometry and compare the results. Also a more oblique POV will give\u00a0 a more pronounced\u00a0Fresnel effect therefore more reflections. From what I can see in your example image the glass unit seams to have quite amount of reflections, if your glare study is for an exterior POV then a mirror like material will give better results\n\nGood luck\n\nclaudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "April 1, 2015 at 7:09pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Amadeo,\n\nI'm not sure if I can fully understand the question but I hope Caludio's answer help.

It is a bit strange though because I noticed that if you use a cloudy sky you will see reflections on the glass, but not for the same condition run with a sunny sky.\n\nThanks!\n\nbye\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "amedeo scofone", "created_at": "April 8, 2015 at 3:59am", "created_by": "amedeoscofone", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHello guys! do you have any idea how to evaluate Disability glare with radiance?
