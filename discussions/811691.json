That sounds great!\n\nI checked your preview video of Honeybee and it looks equally amazing to your Ladybug work so far.\n\nEven the different sub components you have like the floor sub-division per ftf and use, are extremely useful to simplify custom made larger algorithms. You really stretch GH to a new level of usability for real life projects. Your work will be very soon widely used worldwide, replacing relevant software suites.\n\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\n\ndoompop\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "March 19, 2013 at 7:27am", "created_by": "doompop", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Doompop,\n\nDo you have any example of results of the VSC calculation that you can share with me.
