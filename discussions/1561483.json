{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI am making a honeybee based tool to assess daylight factors in rhino. I managed to validate a thin-wall model with results from IES but when I try adding breadth to the walls (basically adding a sill and overhang to the window) my results in rhino diverge, with IES showing DF figures around 20% lower. I modeled the wall thickness as a shading geometry. All radiance parameters are the same between IES and Honeybee.\u00a0\n\nAny chance someone encountered this problem?\u00a0\n\nIs there a good way to account for the wall thickness when doing daylighting sims?\n\n\n\nRegards\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dmitri Korolenko", "created_at": "July 7, 2016 at 8:07am", "created_by": "DmitriKorolenko980", "topic": "Thick wall model daylight factor simulation", "replies": [{"body": "\nIll just keep posting my issues here in hopes someone notices. I solved the thick wall issue by modelling the thick wall in rhino.\u00a0\n\nThe question now is how was honeybee daylight factor results validated? I ran a honeybee calc and and an IES calc with the same parameters. On the attached images the grid is not really matching but you can see the divergence anyway. Some honeybee results are 100% better than ones from IES. Can anyone tell me why? Im not great at Radiance, but maybe there is a set of settings where results would converge? \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dmitri Korolenko", "created_at": "July 11, 2016 at 5:13am", "created_by": "DmitriKorolenko980", "replies": [{"body": "\nforgot to add the picture\u00a0[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/W8zFTI3S9EnpZagfekwekuB9ukfXTTRFzgBIrzC5CVEUwkS0GZRT4bK1TEEMF8hg3z6FrkU2VQNrvj1sfNU2uZcb28nF7LXG/IESHBDFcomparison.GIF?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/W8zFTI3S9EnpZagfekwekuB9ukfXTTRFzgBIrzC5CVEUwkS0GZRT4bK1TEEMF8hg3z6FrkU2VQNrvj1sfNU2uZcb28nF7LXG/IESHBDFcomparison.GIF)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dmitri Korolenko", "created_at": "July 11, 2016 at 5:45am", "created_by": "DmitriKorolenko980", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nif the reflectance is the same in the IES and Honeybee model, there should be no big discrepancy.

Do you know which sky type does IES uses for calculating DF? It might be the difference between uniform and overcast skies.
