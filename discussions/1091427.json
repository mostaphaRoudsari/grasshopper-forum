As far as I can see it is an option for just importing the geometry:([http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/67/106/](http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/67/106/))\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 25, 2014 at 5:52am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you very much for checking the files for my questions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRegarding the capability of DesignBuilder for\u00a0importing and exporting, you can see the file formats which DB allows to import and export from the images below and also from the HELP file of DB in attachments (Page 71: Importing Geometric Data; Page 78-80: Import 3 - D CAD Data). In their HELP file, they mention about \"import geometric data\".\n\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, regarding the input of schedules, loads, constructions and etc., DB normally uses \"Component \" and \"Template\" (Page 29: Templates And Components; Page 591: Templates; Page 533: Components). \"Templates\" are databases of typical generic data, including Activity templates, Construction templates, Glazing templates, Facade templates, HVAC templates, Location Templates, and etc. \"Component \" are databases of individual data items (e.g. a construction type, material, window pane).\n\n\u00a0\n\nBoth \"Component \" and \"Template\" are allowed to be imported and exported by using \"Import / Export library data\" command (.ddf format - DB Database File; Page 734: Import Components/Templates, Export Components/Templates). DB also allows us to build up our own libraries of templates and components (Page 731: Library Management; Page 733: Template Library Management).\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn order to import both geometric information and other information related to schedules, loads, constructions and etc. from GH to BD, we supposed the following two ways:\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. GH(HB+GB) --&gt; gbXML (both geometric and \"Component \" and \"Template\" information) --&gt; DB\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is the way we most prefer. We did see information related to schedules, loads, constructions encoded in the gbXML file generated by GB, but still do not know the reason why DB did not take this information (I also mentioned this in Q6 within the gh file). We assume this might because the gbXML file we create encodes the schedules based on a different template / schema than the one DB expects. We also post this question to the [DB](http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/component/option,com_forum/Itemid,25/sid,ac828b78ef7f1035357c5ac26786ac50/) forum for help.\n\n([http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/component/option,com_forum/Itemid,25...](http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/component/option,com_forum/Itemid,25/page,viewtopic/p,13755/#13755))\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. GH(HB+GB) --&gt; gbXML (geometric information only) + .ddf (\"Component \" and \"Template\" information only) --&gt; DB\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf the first way doesn't work and DB only takes geometric information from the gbXML, then we might think of the other way - generating the .ddf files from GH(HB+GB) to pass the schedule, load and construction information to DB.\n\nI was wondering if it is feasible for HB and GB to have this function? And what is your suggestion to achieve this?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn addition, we notice that DB can export XML files (not gbXML), so we are trying to figure out if DB also accepts / reads the XML file. If so, we might be able to convert the gbXML (with both geometric and schedule information) to XML.

For our case, the \"temperature distribution\" is quite important due to its large volume of the building (because different locations within the large volume/thermal zone have quite different temperatures)\n\n\u00a0\n\nIs there a way, do you think, to figure out the \"temperature distribution\" within a large volume/thermal zone by using OpenStudio?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf we cannot get the \"temperature distribution\" directly from the CFD simulation (because it is time consuming and not suitable for the early phase design), we supposed another compromised way - dividing the large volume/thermal zone into small thermal zones separated by zone boundary surfaces that don't really exist - like \"air walls\" material (in Energyplus/OpenStudio) or \"virtual partitions\" (in DB).\n\n\u00a0\n\nl\u00a0\u00a0 \"air walls\" in Energyplus:\n\n[http://energyplus.helpserve.com/knowledgebase/article/View/18/0/air...](http://energyplus.helpserve.com/knowledgebase/article/View/18/0/air-wall-open-air-connection-between-zones)\n\n\u00a0\n\nl\u00a0\u00a0 \"air walls\" in OpenStudio:(using Energyplus as its simulation engine)\n\n[http://openstudio.nrel.gov/forums/openstudio-plug-google-sketchup/h...](http://openstudio.nrel.gov/forums/openstudio-plug-google-sketchup/help-desk/air-wall-construction-material)\n\nBut if I understand right, according to the OpenStudio Developer, \"air walls\" in OpenStudio are in support of Radiance simulations instead of energy simulations.\n\n\u00a0\n\nl\u00a0\u00a0 \"virtual partitions\" in DB: (using Energyplus as its simulation engine)\n\n[http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/helpv4.1/#Virtual_Partitions.htm?Hig...](http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/helpv4.1/#Virtual_Partitions.htm?Highlight=virtual%20partitions)\n\n[http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/helpv4.1/#Add_Hole.htm?Highlight=holes](http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/helpv4.1/#Add_Hole.htm?Highlight=holes)\n\nA virtual partition is a partition between 2 zones which exists purely to sub-divide the space up and has no corresponding wall in the actual building. Virtual partitions are modelled using a \"hole\" that fills the whole surface area.\n\nThe way that airflow through holes (and virtual partitions) is modelled depends on the Natural ventilation model option selection, including \"scheduled\" and \"calculated\" natural ventilation. In the Scheduled Natural Ventilation, the airflow through internal holes is calculated (using the EnergyPlus Mixing option) based on the airflow rates and schedules for this flow; In the Calculated Natural Ventilation, the airflow through holes is calculated (using the EnergyPlus Airflow network) based on the pressure difference across the opening and a coefficient of discharge of 0.65.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, I was wondering if the gbXML file generated from Honeybee Zones and GrizzlyBear includes(defines) the information regarding these \"holes\" or \"virtual partitions\"? In other words, is it possible to automatically generated \"holes\" or \"virtual partitions\" (which allow airflow between thermal zones) in DB when importing the gbXML file (generated by Honeybee Zones and GrizzlyBear)?\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlternatively, can we just use Energyplus related components in Honeybee to get each different temperature of the subdivided thermal zones which compose the large thermal zone and allow airflow between them? How to achieve this?
