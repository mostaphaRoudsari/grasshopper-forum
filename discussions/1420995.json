{"body": "\nHi everyone,<br/> one of my colleagues wants to post a discussion but they didn't accepted her here on the GrassHopper forum yet. I post the following for her so that you, brilliant minds, are able to start looking at it...<br/>She will join the conversation as soon as they accept her.\n\nThanks in advance,<br/> Claudio<br/> <br/> <br/> Original post from Claudia:<br/> Hi guys, <br/> I\u00b4m new in this forum and I hope I can find here a solution of my problem.<br/> I\u00b4m tring to do an energy simulation (and the next step would be the optimization with octopus) with honeybee and ladybug.<br/> I\u00b4m analyzing a floor of 2600mq with more than 2/3 of external walls glazed. I\u00b4ve got also 174 fins along the perimeter.\n\nThe problem is that when I run the simulation I recive these errors for each window:\n\n** Severe ** GetHTSubSurfaceData: Surface Openings have too much area for base surface=EEE8110BF0A843E9A620_9<br/> ** ~~~ ** Opening Surface creating error=GLZ_0_EEE8110BF0A843E9A620_9_A2E7F42406024C9A833A<br/> ** Severe ** GetSurfaceData: Zero or negative surface area[0.00000], Surface=EEE8110BF0A843E9A620_9\n\nIf i have understood well, according to .err file, the dimension of the window in rhino seems to be bigger then the wall. But it isn\u00b4t! i mean i\u00b4ve tryed also to put a frame to the windows or to scale them but i got the same results. <br/> Do you know why or how i can solve it??\n\naaand it isn\u00b4t finished! even if i checked my Rhino with \"SelCrv, SelBadObject,selLine...\" and i got \"only\" 303 surfaces and 3 polysurfaces i still can\u00b4t find the degenerate surface for which i have these errors:\n\n** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: There are 2 coincident/collinear vertices; These have been deleted unless the deletion would bring the number of surface sides &lt; 3.<br/> ** ~~~ ** For explicit details on each problem surface, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;<br/> ** Severe ** GetSurfaceData: There are 1 degenerate surfaces; Degenerate surfaces are those with number of sides &lt; 3.<br/> ** ~~~ ** These surfaces should be deleted.<br/> ** ~~~ ** For explicit details on each problem surface, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;<br/> ** Fatal ** GetSurfaceData: Errors discovered, program terminates.<br/> ...Summary of Errors that led to program termination:<br/> .....

I deleted these windows and retraced the walls so your model is running fine now (see attached gh file), although the hundreds of surfaces means that it takes an hour to run. \u00a0Anything that you can do to reduce the number of surfaces is going to help you a lot. \u00a0EnergyPlus is not a program that you can simply throw any geometry into. \u00a0Also, as a general note, EnergyPlus does not like it when you put window surfaces right up against the edge of the wall surface as you do here:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Pp9njAMWrxyyRmu1e2D6YQAsf8P3*Qs8HI6D2ISdGcR4jhXerXSE5BQeUKLVef9oI-9lvxy7WY0xRF5LZD3VCx*hRtm3RDsC/Glazingatedges.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Pp9njAMWrxyyRmu1e2D6YQAsf8P3*Qs8HI6D2ISdGcR4jhXerXSE5BQeUKLVef9oI-9lvxy7WY0xRF5LZD3VCx*hRtm3RDsC/Glazingatedges.JPG)\n\nYou have to leave some room between the window and the wall edge.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1421610", "name": "Floor_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 14, 2015 at 8:07pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks a lot for your quick answer!!\n\nNow that i\u00b4ve been accepted i can directly write on this post :)\n\nI didn\u00b4t know that \"**EnergyPlus does not like when you put window surfaces right up against the edge of the wall surface**\", so good to know for the future, thanks a lot.\n\nI would like to ask you another thing: when i open your gh file i recive this message:\n\n\"**IO generated 4 message, would you like to see them?\",** is this related maybe to different plugins you used that i haven\u00b4t installed yet? could you please tell me their name?\n\nThanks a lot again!!\n\nAll the best\n\nClaudia\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "December 15, 2015 at 1:34am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nClaudia,\n\nI did not add components from any other plugins.
