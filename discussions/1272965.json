{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI'm getting 0 KWhr for 'totalSolarGain' internally out of 'runEnergySimulation/readEPResult' for a very simple model with one zone. I have large windows facing north (Australia, so heat gains should be there).\n\nTried all I can think of e.g. changing window material/construction types etc. I've got an EPMaterial with UV/SHGC/VT input to SetEPZone and childSurfaces input to HBSurfaces further down the line.\n\nI'm doing something wrong, so any ideas out there?<br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/><br/>Rob\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1272962", "name": "Canvas 1.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1272963", "name": "Canvas 2.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1272964", "name": "Canvas 3.png"}], "created_by_name": "Robert Doe", "created_at": "April 26, 2015 at 12:37am", "created_by": "RobertDoe", "topic": "totalSolarGain", "replies": [{"body": "\nRobert,\n\nHard to say. it will be helpful to attach the file.\n\nThough it s suspicious that the analysis period is orange.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 26, 2015 at 12:48am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nYes, I nearly re-uploaded that png but it makes no difference.

The more critical one. You hooked the zone, afyter rotating it, to a HB_Mass2Zone. This move cancelled the windows definition. I connected the proper inputs to the HB_createHBZones component instead. If you see in your file the HB_decomposeByType you\"ll see that before the rotate the model is ok and after the rotate it isn't (see group red and green in the attached). Do that in your model not in mine.\n\n2. Critical one also. You connected EP materials to the HB_Surface instead of connecting EP_Construction.\n\nIn the way to understand what was wrong i updated the file, but after finishing the fix this is not important.\n\nGood luck,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1273499", "name": "mod_3_simple_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 26, 2015 at 1:09pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks Abraham,\n\nAll makes sense, I see where I went wrong, and now I've got some numbers out of totalSolarGain which is great. However rotate3D goes through setEPZoneConstruction and seems to be cancelled out, so no rotation.\n\nI guess the energy data/numbers are for the model windows facing east/west. But I wanted to be able test different orientations.\n\nDo you think it's possible?\n\nRob\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1273694", "name": "mod_3_simple_AYtest4.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1273695", "name": "mod_3_constructions.png"}], "created_by_name": "Robert Doe", "created_at": "April 26, 2015 at 6:11pm", "created_by": "RobertDoe", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHmmm ...\n\nWhen i checked i previewed the rotate component and it looked fine.
