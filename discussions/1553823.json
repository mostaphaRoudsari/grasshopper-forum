{"body": "\nHi everybody!\n\nBefore asking a new question i would like to thank you all for all the support you are giving through this page! Thanks a lot!!\n\nI would like to ask you if there is a way to plot\u00a0EnergyPlus results (like Zone Operative Temperature, Zone Windows Total Transmitted Solar Radiation Rate..) in Rhino.. I mean , i would like to see those results as i can see the Daylight Factor after a daylight simulation.\n\nBecause i remember to have seen a video, showing something similar.. is it possible?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 22, 2016 at 10:24am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Plotting EnergyPlus results", "replies": [{"body": "\nClaudia,\n\nYou probably want to connect the results to the LB_reColorMesh.\n\nFrom there you can bake using this component options.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 22, 2016 at 7:38pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks\u00a0a lot Abraham, i think that that component\u00a0is what i was looking for.\n\nBut i have another question:\u00a0how do i create a mesh that fits perfectly with the 8760 values from the EnergyPlus simulation?\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 23, 2016 at 3:13am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nJust to be clear, I would like to have something like that:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNylb42FPIc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNylb42FPIc)\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 23, 2016 at 4:02am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThen you should look at [this](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Comfort_Autonomy&amp;slide=1&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0).\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 23, 2016 at 5:09am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks a lot Abraham!!
