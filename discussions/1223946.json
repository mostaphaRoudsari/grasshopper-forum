{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI wonder if someone with more experience than me in Rhino can answer this.\n\n\n\nIf we have our different surface materials in layers (e.g. opaque walls, windows, window frames, shadings), can we assign each layer in a brep and create glazed and shaded surfaces?\n\n\n\nMy concern is that of course we need orientation for each window, wall and shading device, in order to run the daylighting. Is there a way to assign the orientations on a later step. Or could there be a way of later decomposing the surfaces into directions? (I might be answering to myself here). I hope this is clear. In cases where we have good Rhino models, this can really speed things up in setting up zones and facade elements.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 13, 2015 at 4:25am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Working with layers and daylighting in Rhino", "replies": [{"body": "\nHmm I spoke too soon again.\n\n\n\nJust saw the separate zones by orientation+\u00f6nly on glazing option.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 13, 2015 at 4:32am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}]}
