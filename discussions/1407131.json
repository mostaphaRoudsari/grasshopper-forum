{"body": "\nHi Guys,\n\n\n\nI am new in grasshopper and honeybee so maybe my questions is quite simple. I am developing a simple parametric room model and i am trying to transform the room into a HBzone.\n\n\n\nI have descomposed the whole room into HB surfaces and apply some properties. Then, when i try to create the HBzone a problem appears. The components does not look orage or red but it said that no data is collected.\n\n\n\nCould anyone tell me where is the problem? I have attach a file.\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nEduardo\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1407130", "name": "Test_23november.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Eduardo Artigas", "created_at": "November 23, 2015 at 2:57am", "created_by": "EduardoArtigas", "topic": "Honeybee CreateHB zones problems", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Eduardo!\n\n\n\nI suggest you to study this example:\u00a0\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;amp...;](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Surface_by_surface_geometry_preparation_for_energy_simulation_I)[<br/>](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Surface_by_surface_geometry_preparation_for_energy_simulation_I)\n\n\n\nEnclosed you can find the revised version of your file.\n\nHave a nice day!\n\nAntonello\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1406987", "name": "Test_23november_mod.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "November 23, 2015 at 5:35am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you vey much Antonello!\n\n\n\nIt was really usefull your answer and now i can see everything more clear!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Eduardo Artigas", "created_at": "November 23, 2015 at 8:11am", "created_by": "EduardoArtigas", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1407131"}
