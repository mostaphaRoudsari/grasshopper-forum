{"body": "\nHi all,\u00a0\n\nI am running a thermal comfort assessment in a room with a high level of glazing. I am trying to assess the effect of the windows G-value (or SHGC) on the thermal comfort annually.\n\nHowever, as I change the G-value of the window the annual PPD in the room stays unchanged, which does not make much sense to me. Can someone think of a likely explanation to this?\n\nRegards,\n\nAlejandro\n\nGH definition attached\n\n[shgc%20windows.gh](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3pbaBKayUO-7*oki0lNrc9p4Q6r7zHXoy9huo90Kn4wSQqHrSFmu645rdHJ4PxSpMe2DUhIRynV4ku8xT1WTmPiCy25GZf0S/shgcwindows.gh)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183290", "name": "shgc windows.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "December 8, 2014 at 5:01am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Thermal comfort depending on the G-value of the windows", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi,\n\nThere are two issues here that explain why it is not working, as far as i checked.\n\n1. Where you define the material and construction for the window was not connected to the HB_setEPZoneCnstr component (see 3 in attached), so in theory, until you don't connect here it will use a default material (right Mostapha and Chris?) or the material you assigned previously (see 1 in attached).\n\n2. I updated many of the components to the last definitions, hoping this will help ... but it doesn't.\n\n3. This is the key one, where i think there is some kind of bug, or a big misunderstanding how to operate on my side. After connecting the new defined material to the setEPZoneCnstr (point 1 above), i was hoping this will be taken into account for the simulation. It isn't. I checked the IDF created and i see there that the construction material assigned for all windows is ExternalWindow, which i assume is the default. I see also that the defined materials and constructions are not included there. Maybe there is a problem with the SimpleGlazingSystem?\n\nIn short, you are receiving the same results simply because the materials are not changed in the simulation file.\n\nWill be glad to hear M and C explanations :-)\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183588", "name": "shgcwindows_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 8, 2014 at 10:42am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nYes!
