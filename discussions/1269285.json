{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI'm testing out the effect of a high reflective glazed facade on nearby buildings. I was hoping I can trace the rays that bounce of this facade and reflect back on the surrounding buildings. I've tried the LB Bounce component but no luck so far, sometimes I get a generic error such as \"connect surfaces and sun vectors\" other times I get an error saying \"no reflection\" . I'm not sure if I connected the right inputs, I'm totally confused. I attached my Rhino and Grasshopper files hoping that someone could help me set-up the component.\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1269283", "name": "High_Ref_Glazing.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1269284", "name": "High_Ref_Glazing.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "April 21, 2015 at 11:28pm", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "topic": "Ray_tracing question.", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Rania,\n\nSome issues in your file. See attached a working one. I internalized the geometry for my convenience.\n\nThe inputs for the LB_bounceFromSurface must be integer numbers. The Panel input doesn't recognize them as such.\n\nBesides that you have an issue using Surface components instead of Brep/Mesh. See red groups.\n\nThe last one: the time periods were defined wrong. Fixed. In the file i choose only one hour, so it runs fast.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1269346", "name": "High_Ref_Glazing_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 22, 2015 at 12:44am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThank you so much, I really appreciate it. I tried to figure this out for two whole days and no luck.
