I did this in the attached file before even bringing the masses into the file and the zone breps that you start with are now correctly ready to go for energy simulation.\n\nAs the error on the Read EP Result component\u00a0suggests, the simulation was not being run correctly because of this and no result file was generated.\n\nAlso, I noticed that you changed all adjacent boundary conditions to adiabatic and I really do not recommend this when you have the whole building modeled like this. \u00a0Your cooling loads will likely be a lot higher than reality because the heat will not flow from zone to zone, thereby getting trapped in your zones.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183175", "name": "AGHBeeReadEPResultsIssue_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 7, 2014 at 6:04pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nAwesome, thank you very much!!!\n\n\n\nAlso thanks for the note about the setup of the workflow (putting the \"intersect masses\" component after the creation of HBZones), I\u00b4ll ke\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the boundary conditions, in this case they correspond to existing walls of the building, so for this case there isn\u00b4t indeed any air getting mixed in between.
