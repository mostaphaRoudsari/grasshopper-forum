The default is now that a ground temp of 18C will only be used in cases where the undisturbed ground temperature is below 18C and will be the actual undisturbed ground temperature if it rises above 18C. \u00a0This seems closer to what a lot of the recommendations in the E+ reference give. \u00a0Let me know if this helps.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 4, 2015 at 10:36am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you both very much for your answers!\n\nI updated honeybee to the last version and the issue with the EP construction is solved :)\n\nAs for the adaptive comfort, I solved with the simulationOutputs_, as you saw in the file; unfortunately, I cannot use the ladybug component, as I am currently working in Italy and Germany.\n\nI also thank you very much for the new ground temperature component, it does exactly what I was looking for :)\u00a0\n\n\n\nAbout the additional_Strings component, I am not sure I understand its functioning, so I will try to explain how I think it should work.\n\n1) Does it overwrite everything that is defined with Honeybee?\n\n2) Some of the schedules I want to add are nested inside the internal gains (for example, in People gains, I would like to add the Clothing insulation). Therefore, I should use the additional_Strings to substitute the whole internal gains component from Honeybee with the E+ object, am I right? However, as I don't want lose all the advantage of a parametric software like grasshopper and the optimization of Galapagos, I would like to define all my schedules with the csv schedule component of honeybee and call them afterwards with the additional_Strings as external files.... this way everything should work, right?\n\nNext week I will give it a try and let you know if it worked.\n\n\n\nthank you again\n\nLetizia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Letizia Martinelli", "created_at": "April 5, 2015 at 2:28am", "created_by": "LetiziaMartinelli", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nLetizia,\n\nGlad that the construction and ground temperature issues are solved. \u00a0I have plans to add in a bunch more stuff with adaptive comfort but I am glad that you were able to solve it with the outputs:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/143](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/143)\n\nTo answer your questions about the additionalStrings, it only writes things in addition to what is already written. \u00a0It cannot overwrite the things defined in the connected Honeybee zones.\n\nThe default oupenStudio schedules for people gains are very simple. \u00a0They are literally just a number of people/m2 multiplied by the schedule value and a number of watts/person (represented as an \"occupancy activity\" schedule). \u00a0You can change the number of people/m2 with the \"Set EnergyPlus Zone Loads\" component and you can change the people occupancy schedule just by plugging in a CSV schedule into the \"Set EnergyPlus Zone Schedules\" component. \u00a0You can change the occupant activity (or metabolic rate) of the people by plugging a CSV schedule into the\u00a0\"Set EnergyPlus Zone Schedules\" component.\n\nMy guess is that, if you need a proxy for clothing effects or the rate at which the people heat is going to the zone, editing the occupancy activity will be the closest to what you are expecting. \u00a0However, I get the sense that occupant clothing should not matter much if your occupants are in the zone long enough to reach equilibrium with it. \u00a0Are your occupants only in the space for a brief time or are they adding/removing clothing a lot?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 6, 2015 at 8:34pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\ndear Chris and Mostapha\n\nI am testing the new version of Honeybee and Ladybug with a colleague and I still have some problems.\n\n1) I am sorry to say that the \"monthlyGrndTemps\" in the \"energySimPar\" command does not seem to work for me... I set that as a list (see the attached files) to get 21\u00b0C, but the .idf file always give me the default 18\u00b0C\n\n2) I am working with the \"additionalStrings\" parameter, that is really great to add new features (thank you soooo much for that!). Unfortunately, I still have a problem. As I told you before, I would like to change the section \"People\" of Internal Gains, because I need to add other features that I use in Energy+. Using the \"additionalStrings\", I added the schedules I needed and set up the \"Internal Gains\" as a text, and it worked fine, but now I have two different \"Internal Gains\": the default HoneyBee one and mine, attached to the same Thermal Zone... Even if I skip the \"HoneyBee_Set_Energyplus Zone Loads\", there is still a default Internal Gain that I cannot avoid (see the attached files). How do you think I can solve that?\n\nI know I cannot overwrite the HoneyBee components with the \"additionalStrings\", but can I remove the default Building programs of the Energyplus library, as I do with Openstudio?\n\n\u00a0\n\nI don't know if that is possible, but on the \"Honeybee_bldgPrograms\" command, it would be great to have a \"none\" string corresponding to no default program settings (which, anyway, cannot be used for European standards).\n\nAnother idea that I have, but I don't know how feasible it is, is the possibility to insert new schedules or delete the default ones from the \"HoneyBee_Set_Energyplus Zone Loads\", with the \"Insert Parameter\" command. Of course, these are only suggestions form an end user: just to solve the problem in the easiest way for you would be awesome :))\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoreover, there are a couple of new issues that I haven't experienced with the previous versions:\n\n1) from time to time (more or less every time I run a simulation or change something in the file) the \"Honeybee run Energy Simulation\" gives me this error: \"failed to find M in Library\", where M is either a material name or a construction name. If I connect again the same materials or constructions to the HBSurfaces, or I run the \"update this file\" command for HoneyBee and Ladybug, the error disappears, to come back again for apparently no reason (see the attached files).\n\n2) the \"SimControls\" command does not work anymore, as it does not change the simulation controls according to my true-false sequence (see the attached files).\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you so so much for your work, which is really useful... if you come to Italy sometimes, you know you have a beer paid from us ;)\n\nLetizia\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1260412", "name": "HB_TEST_1004.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1260413", "name": "HB_TEST_1004.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Letizia Martinelli", "created_at": "April 10, 2015 at 9:22am", "created_by": "LetiziaMartinelli", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Letizia,\n\nMaybe we should break down this discussion into multiple discussions so it is easier to follow. I personally have a hard time to track all the issues in a such a long discussion.\n\nBack to\u00a0additionalStrings_, I agree that it will be ideal to be able to overwrite current EP objects if you input the same object but it needs various number of checks to find the correct object that should be overwritten.\n\nWhy do you need a none program for the zone? In case none of the default programs matches your schedule you can add your own schedules to Honeybee and load them for the simulation. If you check Ladybug's default folder there is a file named as \"userCustomEPLibrary.idf\"_ Copy all your schedules, constructions, etc. in the file and they will be loaded into Honeybee library when you let the Honeybee fly.\n\nBack to your issues the first one looks like an issue with order of execution of components, and I will check your file for number two.\n\nI still suggest to break down your questions/wishes into separate discussions so we can make sure to address all of them.\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: In case you have standard schedules, and constructions for European countries we can probably add them to default library.\n\nPSS: I'm coming to Rome this summer!
