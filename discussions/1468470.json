{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI am practicing the honeybee tutorial. I wanna read the radiance file for\u00a0honeybee_Run Daylight Simulation component, however I couldn't find the connection point. Below is the same\u00a0honeybee_Run Daylight Simulation component in two different versions. It's easy to find the 'radiance file' connection point in the first one. How about the second one?
