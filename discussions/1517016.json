{"body": "\nHello everyone, I am having a look at the new IES luminaire components. I was wondering whether it would be possible to input a different multiplier for each value in the candela table. In this way one can control the luminaire web shape through other grasshopper parameters (I.E: on a given spatial coordinate lighting will be omnidirectional, on another it will be a directional spotlight).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pietro Florio", "created_at": "April 26, 2016 at 7:00am", "created_by": "PietroFlorio", "topic": "IES candela tables", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Pietro,\n\n\n\nYou can do it indirectly. See attached. The idea is to split the IES file into text fragments, delete and replace the candela values that you want to modify and then join the file back into a text string.\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1517422", "name": "modifyIES.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "April 26, 2016 at 4:33pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": [{"body": "\nOh, that's smart...
