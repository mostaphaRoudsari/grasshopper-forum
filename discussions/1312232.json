{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI got a quick question. In daylight analysis you often take a picture with a fisheye view and lay a sun diagram on top of it.\n\n\n\nI have a geometry in rhino and would like to set the view to watch the sky from a certain point in my model; rotate it so the bottom is alligned to south and then render a fisheye picture. (like in the picture attached)\n\n\n\nDo you know if there is a simple way to achieve this or even a component in Ladybug/Honeybee that already does this?\n\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://www.bartenbach.com/uploads/tx_userconTandJSPic/Sonnenstandsdiagramm_740x555.jpg\"/>](http://www.bartenbach.com/uploads/tx_userconTandJSPic/Sonnenstandsdiagramm_740x555.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Lechner", "created_at": "June 19, 2015 at 12:36pm", "created_by": "ThomasLechner", "topic": "\"Sun Diagram\" or Watch the sky but with context in it", "replies": [{"body": "\nThomas,\n\nHave you tried the LB_shadingMask component?\n\nIs not doing fish eye view but you can get the projection of the context in the sky.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 19, 2015 at 1:01pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you very much - that did the trick =)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Lechner", "created_at": "June 20, 2015 at 6:30am", "created_by": "ThomasLechner", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1312232"}
