{"body": "\nHi there!\n\nI am trying to validate some results i get from a honeybee energy simulation, and i am getting high discrepancies whenever i turn on the infiltration (meaning the air-leakage, unwanted infiltration that is supposed to be occurring through the building fabric). Is there a possible way that i could set the energyplus infiltration model coefficients through honeybee? There should be 4 such coefficients: A.Constant coefficient, B.Temperature coefficient, C. Wind speed coefficient (linear) D. Wind speed coefficient (quadratic).\n\nthank you!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iason Bournas", "created_at": "February 9, 2016 at 7:42am", "created_by": "IasonBournas", "topic": "Infiltration model in Honeybee", "replies": [{"body": "\nOk i searched a bit more on the possible cause of the error, and it seems that the \"energySimPar\" component cannot accept other values for \"timestep\" and \"terrain\" apart from the default values that are now \"6\" and \"City\" respectively.

Back to EnergySimulationPar I just did a quick test and it works as expected. You can change both the terrain and timestep and they will change inside the .idf file.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/mQqoeU*Xt2bZqhWrJh-1w*sPERX4CpXGbz3ERD0UhEKEGYkR7DVJpSnsiVSpeBN*Xk7OgkSbdDKqgnKI17yfxdbOQGxDJ1iU/changeSimulationParameters.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/mQqoeU*Xt2bZqhWrJh-1w*sPERX4CpXGbz3ERD0UhEKEGYkR7DVJpSnsiVSpeBN*Xk7OgkSbdDKqgnKI17yfxdbOQGxDJ1iU/changeSimulationParameters.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to the original post can you help me to understand what is the exact EnergyPlus object that you're trying to change? Do you have a reference idf file?

I took another look and it's happening because you're using a single number for shadowCalcPar input which is wrong and so the component overwrites the values to default.
