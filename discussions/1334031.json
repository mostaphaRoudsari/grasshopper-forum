You actually can add any standard EnergyPlus schedule to Honeybee. All you need to do is to copy your schedules into \"userCustomEPLibrary.idf\" and they will be loaded automatically once you let the Honeybee fly next time. Finally you can use \"Honeybee_Call from EP Schedule Library\" component to find the new schedules inside Grasshopper.\n\n\n\nYou can find \"userCustomEPLibrary.idf\" under\u00a0Ladybug's default working directory.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 31, 2015 at 4:42am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nIt will be true to say that what you wrote will work ONLY with schedule files (and maybe compact schedules) and that the pointer in the\"userCustomLibrary\" will be to such files?\n\nThe reason i'm asking is that usually schedules in E+ are linked one to another (Yearly, weekly, daily/ hourly).
