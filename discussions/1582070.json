In fact,\u00a0I ran a simple analysis 3 times and I got a little\u00a0different\u00a0values\u00a0for illumination. so if I want to compare different cases with each other I should run all of them at once? and after how many runs does it approach to real values?\n\n\n\nthanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Farzane Oghazian", "created_at": "August 16, 2016 at 1:00am", "created_by": "farzaneo", "topic": "Question about analyzing results", "replies": [{"body": "\nFarzane,\n\nYour question rise quite a few times in the forum under different \"shapes\".\n\nSee [this](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/different-results-for-one-situation) and [this](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/page/search-results?cx=007664031582976519548%3A0mtws3t01h4&amp;cof=FORID%3A10&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Stochastic+radiance&amp;sa=Search&amp;siteurl=www.grasshopper3d.com%2F&amp;ref=www.grasshopper3d.com%2Fgroup%2Fladybug%2Fforum%2Ftopic%2Fshow%3Fid%3D2985220%253ATopic%253A1418152%26xg_source%3Dmsg&amp;ss=4922j3167922j15) and\u00a0[this](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/unpredictable-behaviour-of-lbhb-components) and ... as examples of it.\n\nAs for Real Values, no answer will satisfy your expectations.
