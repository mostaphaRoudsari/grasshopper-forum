I've checked your list: after re-installed Dragonfly, I run\u00a0MyAppInstaller_web.exe (it installed UWGengine v2.2 + MCR v9).\n\n\n\nFrom your link (it seems to be the same of readMe! message of DF, before to install UWGengine + MCR v9) i noticed that MCR version is 2.11, so i've unistalled my previous version (UWG v2.2) then installed that one from your link.\n\nSo I saw that from your point 3) in my ladybug directory there isn't UWG folder, so i copied from\u00a0[https://github.com/hansukyang/UWG_Matlab/commit/f9e7ecb46a1a294dfcf...](https://github.com/hansukyang/UWG_Matlab/commit/f9e7ecb46a1a294dfcfe090f0d084dc674a8f301) UWG.zip and I moved UWG folder to c:\\ladybug.\n\n\n\nMaybe i forget something, so attached my def (that's original one) i suppose that issue is in my machine (programs).\n\n\n\nP.S.: I have the same issue even without specify a new EPW (morphed) path, so I've deleted that one in my attached def.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Luciano", "created_at": "April 21, 2016 at 12:13am", "created_by": "Ambrosinus", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nhere you are.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1512781", "name": "Urban_Weather_Generator_Workflow_v2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Luciano", "created_at": "April 21, 2016 at 12:22am", "created_by": "Ambrosinus", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nthanks anyway, but magically after launching this definition on another PC, and after again on mine it has worked!\u00a0\n\nI would like to ask you some advice about the documents/research consulted to develop Dragonfly/UWG, because I'd like to be able to produce some results with these tools (yours and LB+HB team work) to define the search scope of my doctoral thesis (tips in the direction of the Environmental design are always welcome :) ), always thanks for your support and your work!\n\nP.S .: I hope that the problem does not happen again, I'll stay tuned with all the updates about dragonfly + UWG\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1513188", "name": "Urban_Weather_Generator_Workflow_v2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Luciano", "created_at": "April 21, 2016 at 12:06pm", "created_by": "Ambrosinus", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nP.P.S: I took this two screenshots while UWG running, and i wonder if it's a good thing.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1513199", "name": "01.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1513200", "name": "02.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Luciano", "created_at": "April 21, 2016 at 12:31pm", "created_by": "Ambrosinus", "replies": []}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 21, 2016 at 4:48pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nFirstly thanks for your precious suggestions!\n\nSecondly I have the same issue and I didn't change anything before last run, so with a video capture app I was able to grap a flash command prompt window.
