{"body": "\nHello everyone, I\u00b4m doing preliminary daylight studies for a tall building in Mexico and I am getting weird UDI results as\u00a0can be\u00a0seen in the attached image.\n\n\n\nI only changed the VLT value of the glass in each run 0.17, 0.25 and 0.38 left to right in the image and would seem that lower\u00a0transmittance\u00a0values give quite optimistic results. I\u00b4ve checked the normals of the geometry and tried with other files. I\u00b4ve run\u00a0point in time\u00a0illuminance\u00a0tests that do make sence. It is the annual results that I\u00b4m concerned about. I\u00b4ve attached the grasshopper definition as well. I don\u00b4t know\u00a0what\u00a0I could be doing wrong.\n\n\n\nI would be really\u00a0grateful\u00a0if someone can check it out.\n\nCheers.\n\nArturo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1755146", "name": "VLT-17-25-38-180517.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1755147", "name": "UDI190517.gh"}], "created_by_name": "LUIS ARTURO REYES VALENCIA", "created_at": "May 20, 2017 at 9:24pm", "created_by": "LUISARTUROREYESVALENCIA", "topic": "Weird annual daylight results.", "replies": [{"body": "\nYou are using the 100-2000 Lux range within UDI to compare the performance of your building. As you start increasing visible transmittance of your glass, more number of points will be above the 2000 lux mark, thus decreasing the values within the 100-2000 category.\n\nIf you are concerned about estimating the increase in amount of Daylight as a function of VLT, Daylight Autonomy(DA, called DLA in Honeybee) or Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA) will be a better metric than UDI as both sDA and DA are measures of sufficiency.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 21, 2017 at 5:52pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you very much for the clarification!.
