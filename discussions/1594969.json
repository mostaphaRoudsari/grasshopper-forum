{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm trying to do a radiation/insolation analysis on a project. I had set up a ladybug definition at an earlier workplace and it worked just fine - I got good results that I was able to compare against other programs.\u00a0\n\nWhen I try to replicate the definition at my new workplace I get no results (rather I get only zero values). Since this is a definition thats worked in the past, I think it must be either an issue with the computer, or my ladybug installation. I've checked normals and all the basic steps.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnyone experienced something similar? How do I get around this?\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny insight is much appreciated. I'm attaching my grasshopper file and a \u00a0screenshot.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nVikram.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1594967", "name": "Ladybug1.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1594968", "name": "Radiation_Def.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Vikram Sami", "created_at": "September 6, 2016 at 6:50pm", "created_by": "VikramSami", "topic": "Not getting radiation results", "replies": [{"body": "\nVikram,\n\nYou forgot to internalise the geometry, but the issue is not in the RadiationAnalysis but before that.
