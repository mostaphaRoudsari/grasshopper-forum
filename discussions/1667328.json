{"body": "\nHello everyone\n\nI check the results of LadyBug radiationAnalysis component with energy plus result for\n\nSurface Outside Face Incident Beam Solar Radiation Rate per Area [W/m2](Hourly) .\n\nI have checked the energy plus InputOutputReference and the explanation for this output variable is :\n\n1.9.45.13<br/>Surface Outside Face Incident Beam Solar Radiation Rate per Area [W/m2]<br/>The solar beam radiation incident on the outside of an exterior surface, including the effects of shadowing, if present.

Can you share the results? The way ladybug generates the sky is different from what energyplus does. You can compare the results against the weather data for a horizontal surface. I believe I have answered similar questions a couple of times.\n\nAlso diffuse can be confusing in this case. Ladybug does consider both direct-light and sky-light from the sky.
