There is a GH version, that I got, but I have never had the time to try it out more deeply. I did not talked with him about the idea of having it as a part of LB/HB.

We should speak some more. The difficulty is that right now Pachyderm is changing a lot, but I hope to have things nailed down soon. As Daniel mentioned above, I have begun a PachydermGH plugin which will also be open-source, and maybe, if your project can support a GPL license, we can integrate the two together...\n\nThe grasshopper plugin works well, but there are some things about running acoustics simulations in grasshopper which so far seem clumsy, and which I am not yet satisfied with.\n\nI could definitely use some help from a more experienced grasshopper than myself for these things...
