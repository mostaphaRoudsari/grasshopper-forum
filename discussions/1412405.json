{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI have been trying to model ETFE cushions for EP and Radiance. For Radiance I am introducing manually results as produced by LBNL but for EP I have my doubts if a representation of a single layer using \"windowMaterial\" component is enough as ETFE cushions have a different behavior than that of a glass window. Especially when it comes to model more complex ETFEs with extra (shading/printed) layers and varying behavior during time I think that any simulation that is currently available is not representative enough. Any ideas/thoughts? \u00a0\n\n\n\nI am attaching a paper \"ENERGY MODELLING OF ETFE MEMBRANES IN BUILDING APPLICATIONS\" from H. Poirazis et al\u00a0explaining the \u00a0behavior of ETFEs (p. 701) with with a frit intermediate layer as a reference. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you in advance\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1412404", "name": "ETFE_Paper from IBPSA.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 5:36am", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "topic": "ETFE simulation_ EP and Radiance", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi,<br/>I'm actually struggling with the same problem and I would be interested in hearing what other people think about this topic.<br/><br/>I'm thinking about modeling just one planar surface and then assigning it the properties of an entire ETFE cushion too.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Claudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Marini", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 10:19am", "created_by": "ClaudioMarini", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Caludio and Tatos,\n\n\n\nFor Daylight modeling you can use Radiance's image-mapping. I published a paper recently that discusses the process ([http://www.simaud.org/2015/program.php#a-new-approach-to-modeling-f...](http://www.simaud.org/2015/program.php#a-new-approach-to-modeling-frit-patterns-for-daylight-simulation)). They haven't send it online but I can email you the paper if you're interested to read it in details.\n\n\n\nFor EnergyPlus, I would say the best solution is to generate a BSDF material using the pillows and image mapping process that I mentioned above and apply that to the surface. I'm not an expert in either creating or using BSDF materials though. Andy\u00a0Mcneil has recently published a tutorial on BSDF which might be useful for this case.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 6:35pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks for the info guys!\n\n\n\nMostapha I'd love to take a look at that paper!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 7:24pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHere is the link to the paper:\u00a0[https://copy.com/okY7JzPoVjbF6LrL](https://copy.com/okY7JzPoVjbF6LrL)\n\n\n\nand while we're talking about BSDF materials I recommend everyone to check this presentation:\u00a0[http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2014-london/pres...](http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2014-london/presentations/day1/McNeil_BSDFsandPhases.pdf)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 7:44pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi all, thank you for replying.

Looks like you can use Window to generate BSDF definitions for EnergyPlus ([https://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/7/7.3.4/w7_releasenotes.htm](https://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/7/7.3.4/w7_releasenotes.htm)). Then you should be able to copy the string and apply it as a construction to Honeybee surfaces. Please keep me posted. We can see if there is a better way to implement it to Honeybee.\n\nI developed the component while I was working for the company and technically they own the code. I may re-write a similar component in the near future but for now I don't have the ownership to make the decision. :|\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 1, 2015 at 7:12am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\u00a0\n\nThank you for your reply, indeed you can create. I exported some material already and will apply them. I will update the post soon. Is a pity but understand the copyrights issues! :) \u00a0One thing that bugs me is that the evaluation of the results is more based on common sense rather than accuracy since I am not really sure if E+ will actually reads the created BDSF correctly. Do you have any sort of checkpoints for this? for example when you create material (in HB) and write them in the material library how do you check if E+ runs a correct simulation with the new material?
