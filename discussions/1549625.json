{"body": "\nHey there. I'm having issues with one simple thing. I'm working on a daylight simulation for a room, I'm using climate based sky and set the north with a value list, so I can change the orientation of my room the way I want. But, this changes the north just for the sky, can I change north project to all the model? Because I'm using HoneyBee glazing parameters list to define in what orientation will be the openings, but the north is still the same default, I would like to change to be the same north that I have set up for the sky.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/1LXdY2b2ZgRf2Gj5*vN-VFO9LcJKDHjSANre-6JD3UD*psR91Adx3YQSv4BERrCjRE4YwzO*IcgaRtO9T-66cuDui803jCPk/ModeloAndressaAnliselumnicaporgrid4.gh)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1549624", "name": "Modelo Andressa - An\u00e1lise lum\u00ednica por grid 4.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Andressa L.
