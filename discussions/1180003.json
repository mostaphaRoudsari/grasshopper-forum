It happens on some of systems mine not included. The good news is that as far as you don't make multiple copy from the same Honeybee objects it should be totally fine.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 3, 2014 at 6:58pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI also have the same issue when I build a definition following Honeybee tutorials that Chris uploaded in youtube.\n\nI have on zone only and connected it with the script about adiabatic walls that you uploaded (\u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/honeybee-e-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/honeybee-e-plus-surface-boundary-settings) ) and it gives an error saying NoSun.\n\n\n\nWould appreciate a lot if you have time to check it.\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n-N\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1262851", "name": "HB_nosun.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1262852", "name": "Test HB 2_CWM.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1262853", "name": "setAdiabaticMSR.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Nit\u00eb", "created_at": "April 14, 2015 at 6:05am", "created_by": "Nita", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI am having the same issue.
