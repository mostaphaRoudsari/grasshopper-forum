Again I sincerely apologize if that is what happens when I press true in daylight simulation.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 17, 2016 at 8:30am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "DAYSIMps", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Theodoros, are you referring to the Penn State Version of Daysim?

I know the amount of work that is going on atm behind the scenes though so this isn't really a (high priority) request.

The input files are mostly same. Since we already have electric lighting in Honeybee we should even be able to do lighting zones, control algorithms like integral reset, proportional control etc.\n\nThe only challenge that I foresee is that one would have to replicate logic that is present within the javascript interface. DaysimPS isn't being actively developed anymore since Penn State is now developing\u00a0[STADIC](http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2015-philadelphia/presentations/day1/Mistrick-STADIC.pdf). The last developed features of Daysim can be found in this\u00a0 [presentation](http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co/Mistrick_Daysim-Development.pdf).\n\n\n\nTheodore, What functionality are you looking to leverage from DaysimPS?\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "April 19, 2016 at 4:47pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Sarith,\n\n\n\nWas mostly interested in the control algorithms and the evaluation of photosensors and their impact to energy consumption. As I said I'm only just starting to scatch under that surface I knew about these tools. I do remember however that photosensors and their distribution in space was hard to do (or a bit limited in any case) in E+. Daysim might be an answer (even though I do wish I could use my BSDF files) to this.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI guess if Daysim already does all this in HB then I probably should just go through a tool first before I ask :)\n\n\n\nBtw, thanks a bunch for the electric lighting components. It's amazing having them in an interface like GH and the possibilities for parametric design that gives. I'm working on a definition about this, I'll post it soon for feedback.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 21, 2016 at 8:42am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\n\n\nMostapaha and I had a discussion about this issue a couple of days back. We are working on expanding the capabilities of Honeybee by moving towards matrix-based calculation methods.\n\nBoth Daysim(inside Honeybee) and DaysimPS rely on the daylight-coefficient method which offers almost no potential for incorporating complex shading systems. Any new DaysimPS-related development that we undertake at this point is likely to be redundant within this year.\n\nI had used DaysimPS extensively for my MS Thesis work so I have some idea of what it is all about.
