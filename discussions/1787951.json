{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI created different views to show glare analysis, but it just shows rhino's active view in grasshopper's environment. Also, all of the times I set for the analysis has an imperceptible DGP which seems irregular. I wanna know where the problem is?\n\nThe rhino and grasshopper file is attached here.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nMasoome\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UyG2hh6alTCQhI4kmkMax0mm*K5zVwdi-4gqgtUIEjb0n1*shX5ZGAiD1rpMIDxGgOtRUNA4HZ-m1qVAuJvifYDYiGxt941E/1.PNG\" width=\"696\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UyG2hh6alTCQhI4kmkMax0mm*K5zVwdi-4gqgtUIEjb0n1*shX5ZGAiD1rpMIDxGgOtRUNA4HZ-m1qVAuJvifYDYiGxt941E/1.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1787949", "name": "Glare.gh"}], "created_by_name": "masoome", "created_at": "July 24, 2017 at 1:01am", "created_by": "masoome", "topic": "Glare- Different Views", "replies": [{"body": "\nRhino file\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1787853", "name": "CC.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "masoome", "created_at": "yesterday", "created_by": "masoome", "replies": [{"body": "\nMasoome, Did you connected the view names to the recipe?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "1 hour ago", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}]}
