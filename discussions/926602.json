{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and thanks for your help so far.\n\nOne more question about the component. If we have surrounding buildings and want to take them into account what do we do? In the example that I attach I have extend the rays towards the sun and then trimed them with the surrounding buildings. How can I delete the trimed rays in grasshopper?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nkostas\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A926600", "name": "sunpath.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A926601", "name": "sunpath1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "kostas mourkos", "created_at": "October 7, 2013 at 10:02am", "created_by": "kostasmourkos", "topic": "ray tracing component", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Kostas,\n\nYou need to move the test points first and then use them for raytracing. I also modified the way you generate the test points so they don't intersect with the wall.\n\nThe component also couldn't take untrimmed surfaces into account that I fixed it. Check the attached script and use the raytracing component in this script for the rest of your studies.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/I7biqbcZ7GtmcpoPgyucbYQDuUdlGq-zUuXSV7NUGzJO*8K3ZAdDvNH4-MzE8IRCjVDf9LVWhuhe9i3MHFrtXI3hxg0N1iqu/raytracing_Perspective.png?width=496\" width=\"496\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/I7biqbcZ7GtmcpoPgyucbYQDuUdlGq-zUuXSV7NUGzJO*8K3ZAdDvNH4-MzE8IRCjVDf9LVWhuhe9i3MHFrtXI3hxg0N1iqu/raytracing_Perspective.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A927184", "name": "sunpath1_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 7, 2013 at 9:09pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nYes it was very helpfull.
