Radiance parameters only works for parameters that has a value to be set. Let me see what would be the best way to implement it to Honeybee RADParameters.

I'll let you know if I'll find bugs in the future. Thanks for adding it. I run optimization processes and it's good to be able to turn ON/OFF the randomness.\n\nNow we're able to close quickly the discussions like this one, started by masoumehta, just with a symple \"it's Radiance randomness, just put a -u\".
