{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to learn more and more about the great capabilities of HB an LB. Unfortunately sometimes I remain stuck because of some issues.\n\nRight now I'm having a problem with the Annual daylight simulation component. While for the other simulations I easily change working directory according to the computer path, I cannot do that with this component.\n\nCould someone help me?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nMarco[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/*E1*lxSss-fhy2CKX3AUl5ZIvPT9SQ2rf*c9KROuldUz55R5ov2FMZIVFzUGxFV4*7kgcbzaESv2-Ps-vlVdLG6IXwdnIUxR/Schermata20150112alle20.52.14.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/*E1*lxSss-fhy2CKX3AUl5ZIvPT9SQ2rf*c9KROuldUz55R5ov2FMZIVFzUGxFV4*7kgcbzaESv2-Ps-vlVdLG6IXwdnIUxR/Schermata20150112alle20.52.14.png)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1203168", "name": "Daylight simulation_Annual Daylight problem.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Marco P", "created_at": "January 12, 2015 at 1:03pm", "created_by": "MarcoP", "topic": "HB Annual daylight simulation_cannot find the results", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Marco, Do you have Daysim installed on your system?
