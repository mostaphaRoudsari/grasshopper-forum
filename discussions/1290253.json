{"body": "\nHi!\n\nI am looking for a way to test building envelope to examine Daylight Autonomy with Honeybe Run Daylight Simulation component. Is it possible to introduce context geometry as a shading to observe it's impact on the analysis result? When I connect it to HbRDS's _HBObjects input as a HBSrf it sarts to calcuale, but takes forever.\n\nCan anybody help with the problem?\n\nRegards\n\nKarol\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1290252", "name": "HB_DA_CONTEXT_INTRO.png"}], "created_by_name": "Karol Terlikowski", "created_at": "May 19, 2015 at 3:26pm", "created_by": "KarolTerlikowski", "topic": "Context as a shading in Honeybe Run Daylight Simulation.", "replies": [{"body": "\nKarol,\n\nWill be more helpful if you upload the file in question.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 19, 2015 at 3:45pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nHere it comes.\n\nTnanks!\n\nKarol\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1290828", "name": "HB_DA_CONTEXT_INTRO.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Karol Terlikowski", "created_at": "May 20, 2015 at 7:14am", "created_by": "KarolTerlikowski", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nKarol,\n\nUnfortunately didn't find any way to speed up the process (but increasing the grid size).
