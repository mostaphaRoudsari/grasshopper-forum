The output comes out that way anyways.\n\n\n\n2) transMaterials: Should the sequence follow that sequence? 7 red green blue spec rough trans tspec?\n\n\n\nI get output number different from the inputs as seen in the attached.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\ndimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1331391", "name": "radiance_.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1331392", "name": "Radiance_Materials.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 2:11pm", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Radiance Materials outputs problems", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Dimitrios,\n\n\n\n1. The output is correct and specularity comes first ([http://www.artifice.com/radiance/rad_materials.html](http://www.artifice.com/radiance/rad_materials.html)). The order was a user interface decision and since we have it like this in all the other components I would leave it as it is.\n\n\n\n2. It's a bit more complicated.
