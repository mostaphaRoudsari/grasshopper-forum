{"body": "\nHey all,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'm running into a problem where if two surfaces with windows facing each other, will not correctly define their boundary conditions after passing through the the solve adjacency component.\n\n\n\nWhat is happening is that the wall or parent surface boundary condition is changed to \"SURFACE\" while the window or child surface remains \"Outdoors\". Which is causing the energy simulation to quit, like so:\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/NSP30zoaI8KHrjaCKWmLFM3fNq4d-cgeC3jzXscLzqCLJuUDqLPr6xSGEaOGk-XsLDlH1AjsElqaB5uXIHHPz-7DDuiJgdRt/adj_error.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NSP30zoaI8KHrjaCKWmLFM3fNq4d-cgeC3jzXscLzqCLJuUDqLPr6xSGEaOGk-XsLDlH1AjsElqaB5uXIHHPz-7DDuiJgdRt/adj_error.PNG)\u00a0\n\nI tried to track the down the error in the solve adjacency component - at the updateAdj(...) function the BCs the childsurfaces are failing the condition check for childSurface2.BCObject.name == \"\" and then aren't updated. But I have no idea how to fix this (assuming it's even the correct error!).\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/NSP30zoaI8JVI9YY8AsYpJ1ciOW8Zf1w5bQcRqPxvDEijo4QtsHSVez5hbwFfuUr8eyetIEXC7FywXcwD0M9PmtviKPT2F48/adj_error2.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NSP30zoaI8JVI9YY8AsYpJ1ciOW8Zf1w5bQcRqPxvDEijo4QtsHSVez5hbwFfuUr8eyetIEXC7FywXcwD0M9PmtviKPT2F48/adj_error2.PNG)\n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n\n\nAttached is a simple model where I've reproduced the error.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1783889", "name": "plenum_envelope_adjacency_error.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "July 14, 2017 at 2:27pm", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "topic": "E+ error due to mismatched boundary conditions for adjacent surfaces", "replies": [{"body": "\nSaeran,\n\nThe issue that you experience is because you set the altConstruction to \"air wall,\" which basically tries to get rid of all interior windows (or, in this case, it does not handle them well). \u00a0Just remove the air wall construction and you will see that you get the interior windows as expected.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 14, 2017 at 11:38pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nAh excellent, thanks Chris!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "July 18, 2017 at 2:22pm", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1783890"}
