Run a visualization of your scene via HBEE, and if it looks ok on screen, all should be well. In practice, it is very hard to fix all rpict errors a simulation spits out. In 99.9% of cases it does not mess up your results.\n\nBest,\n\nMax\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Max D", "created_at": "July 4, 2016 at 6:57am", "created_by": "ButWhyprecisely", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1559632"}
