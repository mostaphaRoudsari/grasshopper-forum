Defined the EPBC as adiabatic and also but right after the definition i connected this geometry to the HB_makeAdiabatic component.\n\nI expected that when creating the IDF file this surface will be registered as a \"surface\" (i.e. internal wall). Now revising the idf i see that this surface is registered as \"Outdoors\". So, no way, that the adiabatic condition will be applied or taken into consideration for the simulation.\n\nAm i missing something?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 9:57am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "Adiabatic or Outdoors", "replies": [{"body": "\nTo be more accurate in my question: Defining EPCB as adiabatic sets the geometry as \"Outdoors\" non exposed to sun or wind.\n\nWithout the EPCB input but using the HB_makeAdiabatic sets the geometry as \"Outdoors\", sun and wind exposed.\n\nI was expecting the geometry to be \"Surface\" no exposed to sun and wind.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 12:38pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nI have read over your post a few times and I am still having trouble understanding your question. \u00a0It sounds like there is a solve adjacency component some where in your situation that changes some tings. \u00a0Can you send a picture or a GH file that re-creates the issue?\n\nAll that I can say right now is that setting the EPBC to Adiabatic and passing a srf through the Make Adiabatic component still results in an adiabatic surface:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5ihJsFRcOvPzX*8iYFxnaXch4RhqqQSZH6FziY9WXU9N4ql4j*lbLWpyL3qA0vEcHXvK7XGNJ5APWJ3CMmGgOcVXahpGhASp/Adiabatic.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5ihJsFRcOvPzX*8iYFxnaXch4RhqqQSZH6FziY9WXU9N4ql4j*lbLWpyL3qA0vEcHXvK7XGNJ5APWJ3CMmGgOcVXahpGhASp/Adiabatic.JPG)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 6:31pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThere is in effect a solveAdjacency on the way.

So far so good.\n\nNow i get to the HB_makeAdiabaticByType, and some issues appear (See A in the file).\n\nSetting the interiorWalls to True doesn't change the condition from\"surface\" to \"adiabatic\" (A1 in file).\n\nSetting the walls set both internal and external, to adiabatic (A2 in file). Is this supposed to work like this? Why the just the internal doesn't make the change?\n\n\n\nIn addition to this i'll appreciate your advice in the following. Let's say that i want the internal walls to be divided in 2 parts each. One should be adiabatic and the other \"air wall\". How do you recommend to do this?
