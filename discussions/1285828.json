{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\nI just updated everything (firstly manually including gh, python, lb&amp;hb), then with the update component. My old file didn't run anymore. Now I started it from scratch. And the \"honeybee_Glazing based on ratio\"-component comes up with \"solutionexception of unsized object. I just delete it and place it again, then the two upper HB_createHBSrfs ask for a component update. And two of five shaders are failing to collect data.\n\nWhat happens here?\n\nTHX\n\nD\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1285826", "name": "1.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1285827", "name": "2.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "May 13, 2015 at 4:27am", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "topic": "update issues", "replies": [{"body": "\n...and the gh-file\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1285925", "name": "150119_VF_W_monovolume_S_bug.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "May 13, 2015 at 4:48am", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Daniel,\n\nThis is probably so late but I checked the file and you needed to clean your test points (or to be more accurate you needed to also connect the ground floor). You also needed to clean your input geometries. There was a None object in the list. Also name of surfaces shouldn't have space. That will make Radiance to fail.\n\nChecked the attached file!\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1324530", "name": "150119_VF_W_monovolume_S_bug_MSR.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 12, 2015 at 1:48pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}]}
