{"body": "\nI am trying to simulate a building which has 4 office towers, three spaces which connect the towers, southern and eastern corridors/egress, and a podium which the aforementioned massing sits upon. I have created each of these as a separate piece of geometry and each can be independently run through EnergyPlus, however my intent is to run all of them as a whole building. I have not been able to do this yet due to the fact that when I intersect the separate masses to ensure that the surfaces are divided properly I am unable to proceed in the simulation workflow because I am getting a \"Solution Exception: NoneType object has no attribute 'Centroid'\" error.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat could I be doing wrong such that I am getting this error?

I am going to post these all to Guilio at some point soon but I have developed a few workarounds in the interim.\n\nNotably, I just loaded a few more into the Intersect masses component after looking deeper at your issue and it should now be able to handle core and perimeter zones and not fail (though I still recommend baking/checking the output geometry). In any case, your primary problem was resulting from the fact that you put intersected geometry into the splitBldgMasses component and this is not recommended. \u00a0You usually want to use the intersectMasses component after you have split your building up into zones. \u00a0I have since put in a warning to make users aware of this if they do input intersected geometry.\n\n\n\nSo the general guidelines for using these components are as follows:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/y39xTR5a6g5zYOIJRe674usBmGCda0Ajz*gOhnl6luX-KO7sRu44jz1yWZqIQh1DfWJcaXp1nrzqmD-WWBU2fWnPF6XDY3oq/InstructionsforbreakingupBldgMass.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/y39xTR5a6g5zYOIJRe674usBmGCda0Ajz*gOhnl6luX-KO7sRu44jz1yWZqIQh1DfWJcaXp1nrzqmD-WWBU2fWnPF6XDY3oq/InstructionsforbreakingupBldgMass.PNG)\n\n\n\nI have attached a GH file that shows you these results with your building geometry. \u00a0Let me know if you encounter any other things that seem like big bugs as you assemble the zones for the rest of your building.\n\n\n\nAnd a happy Day of the Dead!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 1, 2014 at 7:26pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nWoops. \u00a0Forgot to attach the right GH file\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1160141", "name": "ExperiementStatenIslandCourthouse_CWM2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 1, 2014 at 7:36pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHello Chris, I have a similar problem, except that I am not using the Intersect Masses component.
