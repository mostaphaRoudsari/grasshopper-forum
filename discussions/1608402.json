I will test this at some point myself and report back here. If you don't use IronPython in Dynamo just uninstall the IronPython which is installed in Program Files folder and everything should work fine.\n\n\n\nHope it helps.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 25, 2017 at 7:06pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nI also try with Rhino 5 and the latest GHPython Component.
