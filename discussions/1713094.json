{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nFirst of all I am impressed by your work LB+HB can solve a lot of problem.\n\nI am a new user and I was wondering if it would be possible to export a grid of the indoor solar heat gain on the floor.\n\n\n\nI want to calculate the comfort of the building, but due to 100% ratio of glazing I have to introduce the solar gain to calculate a new mean radiant temperature.\n\nI saw that the component \"Ladybug_Outdoor Solar Adjustor\" calculate it but only on a mannequin, It would be amazing if I can calculate through the whole floor of my building.\n\nIs there a way to do that ?\n\n\n\nThank you all for your help!\n\n\n\nMehdi\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mehdi HAMDANI", "created_at": "March 15, 2017 at 10:23am", "created_by": "MehdiHAMDANI", "topic": "MRT Calculation", "replies": [{"body": "\nMehdi, Have you checked the examples on [Hydra](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/)?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 15, 2017 at 7:11pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nMehdi,\n\nYou want to use E+ to calculate the floor surface temperature and the microclimate maps to calculate the total MRT. \u00a0[Here's the specific example](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Microclimate_Map_-_Simple&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0).\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 15, 2017 at 8:08pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris and Mostapha thank you for your answers,\n\n\n\nI went through the examples but I didn't find what I was looking for. I saw the Radiation_in_an_Urban_Canyon example but it uses the ladybug radiation analysis, and I need to take into account the reflections for my project.\n\n\n\nChris is the total MRT from th microclimate maps uses the \"**effective radiant field**\" Model ?\n\n\n\nLet me tell you more about my project, it's about the comfort in the semi-opened spaces, I first introduce a new PMV OutSET into EnergyPlus which calculate the comfort from the steady state and not the permanent state, because the people will only be here for a few minutes and the body will not body in his permanent state.\n\n\n\nNow I have to modify the calculation of the mean radiant temperature, I first did a study where I took several values of the solar heat gains from 9 points. It appeared that the thermal comfort changed a lot between the different points.\n\n\n\nDue to this conclusion I am looking for a way to obtain a map of the solar heat gain through the floor of the railway station to calculate a new mean radiant temperature (using the energy radiant field model) to finally obtain a comfort map of the building.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI hope you understand the problematic of the project I have,\n\n\n\nThank you for your help,\n\nMehdi.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mehdi HAMDANI", "created_at": "March 16, 2017 at 3:54am", "created_by": "MehdiHAMDANI", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1713094"}
