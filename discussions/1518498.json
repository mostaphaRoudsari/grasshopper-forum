Solution exception:'Mesh' object has no attribute 'DuplicateVertices'\".\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'd love to get this component working, I really need to visualise comfort and temperature data over surfaces in building!\u00a0\n\n\n\nRhino 5 SR5, GH0.9.0076 and have updated LadyBug and Honeybee and all components.\n\n\n\nMy gh file is attached illustrating problem.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nFrank\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1518497", "name": "Indoor_View_Factor_Calculator_Problem_02.gh"}], "created_by_name": "fjb", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 3:49am", "created_by": "fjb", "topic": "Honeybee_Indoor View Factor Calculator, \"Solution exception:'Mesh' object has no attribute 'Vertices'", "replies": [{"body": "\nFJB,\n\nI really appreciate your simple file that focuses on just the issue at hand. \u00a0I can verify that the file is working on my machine and that you are getting the issue because of your version of Rhino.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Yh-B8VrdxHgZZHr1TA7Vx2uAyhuaaGSox0cCxnNcb1datNn9rwYK1OdbixlkLGXz8T2Gszpogx158WMuCSCKqXP7A*PpSHEf/MeshVertices.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Yh-B8VrdxHgZZHr1TA7Vx2uAyhuaaGSox0cCxnNcb1datNn9rwYK1OdbixlkLGXz8T2Gszpogx158WMuCSCKqXP7A*PpSHEf/MeshVertices.JPG)\n\nI am nearly positive that the component would work as-is if you update your Rhino to the most recent Service Release (SR 12) but I think that we can find a good workaround in the meantime if this is difficult.\n\nCan you let me know if the component in the attached file works with your SR5 version?\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1518994", "name": "Indoor_View_Factor_Calculator_Problem_02_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 1:58pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nAmazing!
