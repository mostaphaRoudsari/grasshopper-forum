{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nWe are trying to change the ZoneCapacitanceMultiplier:ResearchSpecial for an energy model to test thermal mass. However, we are not sure how to proceed. We tried a couple of things a failed:\n\n\n\n- How would we add this information to the additionalStrings_ on the HB run energy simulation?\n\n\n\n-We can \u00a0change the values on the idf editor and we can read the results from it, However we are tying to make a parametric model and this manual step is not ideal.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nJuan Carlos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Juan Carlos Fornino", "created_at": "July 5, 2017 at 10:22am", "created_by": "JuanCarlosFornino", "topic": "HB EnergyPlus ZoneCapacitanceMultiplier:ReseachSpecial", "replies": [{"body": "\nJuan,\n\n\n\nYou should be able to add a\u00a0ZoneCapacitanceMultiplier:ResearchSpecial object with additionalStrings_. \u00a0This example file shows you how to format the strings to add them to the IDF (although the example is adding an evaporative cooling tower instead of your capacitance multiplier):\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Evaporative_Cooling_Tower&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\nJut copy/pasting the text that you add to the IDF with the IDFeditor into a panel will get you most of the way there.\n\n\n\nAlso, you should know that, if you want to boost the thermal mass of a zone, there is a component for that (Honeybee_Add Internal Mass to Zone):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/aUSeK2H4tDg0XVsjNgPYt9JfvNK0H2VQHmZ5DbEZq5BGfKpGlU-NJizZ5urJ5YIpaqTuzTvE3ev12YEexkg-k5-kxdRLDmzI/ZoneThermalMass.JPG\" width=\"372\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/aUSeK2H4tDg0XVsjNgPYt9JfvNK0H2VQHmZ5DbEZq5BGfKpGlU-NJizZ5urJ5YIpaqTuzTvE3ev12YEexkg-k5-kxdRLDmzI/ZoneThermalMass.JPG)\n\nHowever, it is not using the\u00a0ZoneCapacitanceMultiplier:ResearchSpecial object so it may not be exactly what you are looking for.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 6, 2017 at 4:59am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}
