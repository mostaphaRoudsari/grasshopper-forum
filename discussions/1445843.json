This is causing a couple of problems.\n\n\n\nOne of the issues is that the stair zone surfaces adjacent to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th zone vertical surfaces with windows are failing as the stair surfaces are looking for glazed child surfaces. \u00a0You can split out your surfaces and then solve adjacencies to overcomes this so that surfaces with windows are not adjacent. You can of course split these out in the geometry beforehand. I'm not sure if this is a recurring problem as I have not noticed it before, perhaps Chris or Mostapha can comment.\n\n\n\nI've also a feeling that as you have split your zones the zone centre point is being thrown out so if you rebuild the zones afterwards this should overcome the issue.\n\n\n\nApologies as I have updated the file to new HB but I don't think this was causing the problem.\n\n\n\nI'd take notice of the report output as you have a number of warnings coming out of that file.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nDuncan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "May 24, 2016 at 6:32am", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nfile here\u00a0[http://dropcanvas.com/6bq0v](http://dropcanvas.com/6bq0v)\n\n\n\nalso having issues with attaching files\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "May 24, 2016 at 6:46am", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Duncan thanks for the help it's running the simulation.\n\nI basically did again the solve adjacencies after the glazing surface process, and now it seems okay I think.\n\n\n\nHowever, after running the simulation and trying out the 'ColorZones' component, it colors only the floor of each zone and not the entire zone itself.\n\nI checked the zone list and there are 6 items each a zone, not surfaces, so this is strange that it would color only one surface in each zone....\n\n\n\n[http://dropcanvas.com/#2o15aN91iQH9fL](http://dropcanvas.com/#2o15aN91iQH9fL)\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks again.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yafim Simanovsky", "created_at": "May 24, 2016 at 8:41am", "created_by": "YafimSimanovsky", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nYafim\n\n\n\nJust plug the zone breps to a custom preview geometry and the zone colors to the custom preview shader.
