Ladybug sun-path doesn't plot the last hour in the analysis. For example if you go to school form 9-6 you're not going to be at school at 6 itself. There a number of discussions on the forum about this topic. You simply need to add one more hour (25 hours) to see 24 hours on sun-path.\n\n\n\n2. When you reduce the mesh density there are cases that test point falls behind the mesh face which will get no radiation. To avoid this issue you need to increase _distanceFromBase.\n\n\n\nHope it helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 23, 2016 at 5:15pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nI just saw the reply from Antonello.
