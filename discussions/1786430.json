The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error:\n\n[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/gENxVTfXsZ8h-metPs7u3-MXtZgiwUaQiwrpjTEzBmWL*VW9WzCkDsvTwWqi2CvHTVAS34H68N8U*z8Sk5yFnxQPTV2hNZBF/01.jpg)** Severe ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 23 surfaces which are casting surfaces and are non-convex.\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean?\u00a0\n\nI have attached the building image in this post. Also input screen as well. I have assigned shading device to HBContext where as others to HBSurfaces.\n\n\n\nit is a long corridor facing West, so I have installed lots of louvres\u00a0along the facade to avoid excessive\u00a0heating load throughout the year.\n\nI can also upload the file if it is necessary.\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1786428", "name": "02.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1786429", "name": "03_input.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "john chun", "created_at": "July 20, 2017 at 12:54am", "created_by": "johnchun", "topic": "Simulation Error with Calculating Energy Loads", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi John,\n\nPlease check\u00a0[this](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/your-simulation-probably-did-not-run-correctly?xg_source=activity)\u00a0and\u00a0[this](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/energyplus-non-convex-casting-sufaces-issue).
