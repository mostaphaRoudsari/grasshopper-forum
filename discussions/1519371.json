{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Chris,\n\nI am running into a problem and can't find a solution.I think it\u2019s a little bug in modeling.I have a box inside another box(as you see in the picture) . I want to solve the adjacencies to run an EP simulation . if the inside box is just in the center of the outer box, \u201dHoneybee_solve adjacencies\u201d \u00a0component doesn\u2019t work correctly and doesn\u2019t show the adjacencies of walls but if I move the inner box a few centimeters away it will work corrently and shows the adjacencies of the two boxes.i got confused and I don\u2019t know how to fix it!. :(\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/I1LXz*DTQO*WuBOQ1SXy7KvB-SnuDjyILkSP5nM5x2CZ1ubRQwq53wgTxXNncJ1cmNt7XyIqLAkuyLmFGQGMM74II2arn3HL/pic1.jpg\" width=\"698\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/I1LXz*DTQO*WuBOQ1SXy7KvB-SnuDjyILkSP5nM5x2CZ1ubRQwq53wgTxXNncJ1cmNt7XyIqLAkuyLmFGQGMM74II2arn3HL/pic1.jpg)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/I1LXz*DTQO8Z9SpBz1mBIC429NSMNZRJNxOMHR2csVYQke*2pUAnGErlyTBYq2-GJWx-L3G--sxKtDzLUNj8ebKAvL*MiXMA/pic2.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/I1LXz*DTQO8Z9SpBz1mBIC429NSMNZRJNxOMHR2csVYQke*2pUAnGErlyTBYq2-GJWx-L3G--sxKtDzLUNj8ebKAvL*MiXMA/pic2.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1519369", "name": "adjacencies.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1519370", "name": "test adjacencies.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Iman Khayat", "created_at": "April 30, 2016 at 6:39am", "created_by": "ImanKhayat", "topic": "Problem with honeybee_solve adjacencies component", "replies": [{"body": "\nIman,\n\nThe process to create the zones should be different than what you propose (based on surfaces).\n\nSee attached a working file.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1519408", "name": "testadjacencies_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 30, 2016 at 1:24pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nthank you Abraham for your\u00a0answer.i knew that intesrsect component but it doesnt show the wall adjacencies in \"read me pannel\"! the problem is that its not working with the brep that are in the **center** of another breps!if i move it further it will work correctly and shows the adjacencies in read me pannel.i think it should be a problem from honeybee.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iman Khayat", "created_at": "April 30, 2016 at 11:48pm", "created_by": "ImanKhayat", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nTry the attached.\n\nI used a different approach for the initial geometry.
