{"body": "\nHi everyone!\n\n\n\nI have two issues that I am stuck on and I would really appreciate if someone could help me!\n\n\n\n1. As indicated on the attached picture I have 4 roof surfaces for which I calculated hourly surface temperatures. The problem is that I want to make an average for every hour out of all 4 surfaces, but the data is not divided into branches and instead of getting data for 4 x 8760 I get all data at once (35000).\u00a0\n\n2. The second problem I have is related to the data is related to the walls. How can I classify the orientation of each surface (north, east, etc...). The reason I want to do this is to make an average temperature of all surfaces located towards each orientation.\n\n\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\nMihail\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1266973", "name": "HB surfaces test.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1266974", "name": "data.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Mihail Todorov", "created_at": "April 19, 2015 at 5:04am", "created_by": "MihailTodorov", "topic": "Honeybee data sorting", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mihail,\n\n\n\n1. I haven't opened the file but I assume it is a result of grafted data for _srfData input. You just need to flatten it.\n\n\n\n2. Honeybee doesn't have a component for that but you can use Grasshopper and check the angle of each surface normal to Y-axis (which is north).\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 19, 2015 at 6:56am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha!\u00a0\n\n1.
