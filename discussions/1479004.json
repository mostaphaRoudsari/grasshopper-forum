{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nIs there a way to have the PV component read the power generation of a vertical surface? I get an error whenever I try. I know the generation will be minimal compared to properly angled panels, but I want to test it for low west light in the winter months.\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Scott Carncross", "created_at": "March 7, 2016 at 8:42am", "created_by": "ScottCarncross", "topic": "Vertical Photovoltaics in Ladybug", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Scott,<br/><br/>Certainly you can.
