The directory already contained the\u00a0OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf file but when opening that in notepad, I found out that this was a fake - it was in fact an html file that get generated by the system at work that blocks access to all kinds of websites (considered social networking). Replacing that file with the one I now downloaded from dropbox, fixes everything...\n\n\n\nOK, a quick test shows that there are other instances of root access, e.g. the 003_shadowanalysis file has the\u00a0c:\\shadowStudy path.
