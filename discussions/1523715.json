{"body": "\n\n\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI am trying to run a \u00a0radiance study where I measure the cumulative solar radiation on a grid over the year - (grid based simulation type 1)\n\n\n\nHowever I am confused as to how to set the solar gain properties of the glass which is in front of the grid.

Lighting calculations, as performed by Radiance/ AGI32/Dialux are basically\u00a0[photopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopic_vision) calculations that intend to describe the brightness of light sources. Although this wikipedia page doesn't do justice to this topic, it is a good starting point to read more on subject: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_function)\n\n\n\nIn very simplistic terms, the values of 0.265, 0.67 and 0.065 \"weight\" the radiation calculated by Radiance and conform them to our visual system. They are used almost everywhere in daylighting simulations inside Radiance when the results are being finalized from RGB triplets to a single Illuminance/Luminance value.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 11, 2016 at 8:47pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Sarith\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply, I do understand that\u00a0theavrgTrans relates radiative energy to visible light (by humans) what I am trying to understand is how this is calculated within radiance.\n\n\n\nI am guessing that within the daysim code for daylighting simulations the same formula (0.265, 0.67 and 0.065) is used to convert the radiative energy transmitted through the glass into visible light.\n\n\n\nIs this correct?\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "May 12, 2016 at 11:56am", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n\nIt is that formula or a variation of that formula depending on context.
