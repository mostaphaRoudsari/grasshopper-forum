{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nFor some reason whenever Iopen a HB file an error sign **\"You should first let Honeybee to fly\"** always appears on the \"**Honeybee_ListZonePrograms**\" and \"**Honeybee_Call from EP Construction Library**\" tabs although the HB and LB tabs have always been on the canvas. (Attached are the screen shots)\n\n\n\nWhenever I reconnect the tabs they run ok but I am sure this is not what should normally happen.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone know how I can fix this problem?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nDaniel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1253707", "name": "HB Error1.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1253708", "name": "HB Error2.png"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Mak", "created_at": "March 31, 2015 at 10:46pm", "created_by": "DanielMak", "topic": "Error when opening HB LB file", "replies": [{"body": "\nYou should send the LB_LB and HB_HB components to the back, so they are executed first when the file opens (Ctrl+B).
