You don't need to use Add glazing to add glazings when you use glazingBasedOnRatio. It has been already added to the surface.\n\n2. You are applying glazing materials with 0 transmittance to the glasses and that's what makes DF results 0. If you don't know properties of the glass just leave it as it is and Honeybee uses the default values. Are you willing to change the glass properties?\n\n\n\n2-1. Name the materials so they don't overwrite each other as \"noName\".\n\n\n\nCheck the attached file.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/t08dki1KeXzGlIvFXzwruZ1Z2CKbyDsiFHG2PAxtgipwWbjNxJNjnYNSPeEK8T7QYVmOc76*dBSBLrFXX7mGRZ6PiOg2H20D/addGlz.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/t08dki1KeXzGlIvFXzwruZ1Z2CKbyDsiFHG2PAxtgipwWbjNxJNjnYNSPeEK8T7QYVmOc76*dBSBLrFXX7mGRZ6PiOg2H20D/addGlz.png)\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1062754", "name": "1404_CampusOutremont_DF_Anlysis_MSR.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 30, 2014 at 8:32pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "May 1, 2014 at 7:07pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\n\n\nYou are welcome. That is great to hear as that is the main intention behind the whole development of Ladybug: ([http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/bs2013/p_2499.pdf](http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/bs2013/p_2499.pdf))\n\n\n\nYes. You can model them similar to any other surface in your model. Just model the shadings as surfaces and then assign either translucent material or transparent material (glass) to them and connect them to runDaylight with other Honeybee objects. Is that make sense?\n\n\n\nMake sure to use appropriate numbers for -ab, -ad and -aa. Check page 27 of Daysim tutorial for a an example for parameters ([https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16228160/Daysim3.0.Tutorial.pdf](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16228160/Daysim3.0.Tutorial.pdf)). I should add that the numbers are slightly high in the example though.
