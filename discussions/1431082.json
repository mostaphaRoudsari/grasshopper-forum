{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI am trying to run a daylighting simulation in order to create lighting schedules for a multi-zone energy simulation.\n\nWhen I create a simple box geometry and use Honeybee's 'SplitBuildingMass' component and run the daylight simulation, it seems to work fine. I get 15 different lighting schedule files for the 15 zones that is in the building geometry.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/O7rpupHifA2KV2zhyoPBIvA9yUehiGzQNg1Rt17GwgGiTJN1093lEo-d5YHowAIqWPSLGaM2oVb3hF4PvLpePEIrF4ofL*q9/1.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/O7rpupHifA2KV2zhyoPBIvA9yUehiGzQNg1Rt17GwgGiTJN1093lEo-d5YHowAIqWPSLGaM2oVb3hF4PvLpePEIrF4ofL*q9/1.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when I try to run the same simulation for a custom geometry that I created in Rhino, it does not work and the output is empty.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/O7rpupHifA0MI8pxMZz8hDIkXuJftI7q9V9Sdr9QhltePB2gw85O8pPzk9cABKNqYabpDPQ8zUBVOin9ql9GI6eqfHCcpQ8S/2.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/O7rpupHifA0MI8pxMZz8hDIkXuJftI7q9V9Sdr9QhltePB2gw85O8pPzk9cABKNqYabpDPQ8zUBVOin9ql9GI6eqfHCcpQ8S/2.jpg)\n\n\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what I might be doing wrong? The zones/elements from my custom geometry seem to be recognized fine by the system. I just don't get any results.\n\nI have attached the gh file with the geometries internalized in case anyone wants to take a look.\n\nAppreciate it!\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\ns\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1431081", "name": "Test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Saurabh Shrestha", "created_at": "January 5, 2016 at 12:17pm", "created_by": "SaurabhShrestha", "topic": "Lighting Schedules for EnergyPlus", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Saurabh,\n\nCan you check the readMe output and see if there is any error?
