{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI used components of Ladybug and Honeybee to calculate the temperature of simple box, I set room temperature plus\u00a020 Celsius degree(+20), the part of result as following:\n\n\n\n1, the temperature of wall external surface is plus 20.4 Celsius degree(+20.4) at 14:00 when\u00a0\u00a0the ambient\u00a0temperature is about minus 19 Celsius degree(-19),\u00a0\n\n2, the\u00a0the temperature of wall external surface is minus 20.1 Celsius degree(-20.1) at 1:00AM when\u00a0\u00a0the ambient temperature is about minus 17.5 Celsius degree(-17.5),\u00a0\n\n\n\nit seems strange, the\u00a0temperature of wall external surface is greater\u00a0than room temperature in afternoon in the winter. and\u00a0the\u00a0temperature of wall external surface is\u00a0low than ambient temperature in night in the winter.\n\n\n\nMaybe I used components incorrectly, or maybe it is a bug.\n\n\n\nSomeone have some suggestions?\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\n\n\nSolon\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1664307", "name": "Temperature.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1664308", "name": "Sample of Single box.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Solon", "created_at": "December 30, 2016 at 6:44pm", "created_by": "w9002", "topic": "Temperature problem - Ladybug + Honeybee", "replies": [{"body": "\nIf radiation falls on the wall in the winter then it can have a higher temperature than the room.
