{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nSince a few days I have searched solution for my project and I couldn't find, so\u00a0I hope\u00a0you will be able to help me.\n\nI have to do Sun analysis for my final project and I found out that the\u00a0best for it is Ladybug,\u00a0so I have been starting to watch some tutorials ( also it's my first time when Im using Grasshopper)\u00a0in order to fix it.\u00a0I think\u00a0that\u00a0less or more\u00a0I've done\u00a0my\u00a0Sun Path, but now there is a problem which I cannot solve.\n\nMy building is the green one, and I want to extend it as long as I can. But becouse of regulations I cannot\u00a0overshadow the building (\u00a0only the red surface) \u00a0which is next to my. The minium hour of shadowed has to be 1,5 -2.\n\nIs it any chance to extend my building according to requirments which I wrote ? Some parametric solution ? Or do I have to do it manually by trial and error?\n\n\n\nPs. I heard that Galapagos is a tool which could help me, but I've no idea what it is :([<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/yu7QMiCGvgFbiojKWKM*9Jfkp8HLnLZfSLWAw6FYfVo4F1n53B1bEWoJpOn72fpJB3*kZjp9HbAhOUaFObr8XX5Owe0TOe0J/SunPath.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/yu7QMiCGvgFbiojKWKM*9Jfkp8HLnLZfSLWAw6FYfVo4F1n53B1bEWoJpOn72fpJB3*kZjp9HbAhOUaFObr8XX5Owe0TOe0J/SunPath.jpg)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1772023", "name": "Sun_Path_lepszy_RhinoAutosave(20388).3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1772024", "name": "Sunpath_part3.gh"}], "created_by_name": "\u0141ukasz Dwulit", "created_at": "June 20, 2017 at 12:20pm", "created_by": "LukaszDwulit", "topic": "SunPath", "replies": [{"body": "\nThis is an interesting question. You don't need to use Galapagos for this as there are analytical approaches to find the volume. Here is one approach that you can use the solve the problem.\n\n\n\n1. Create the maximum volume that you can extrude.\n\n2. Find the problematic area on your surface ([check this example on Hydra](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Central_Park_Shadow_Study&amp;slide=2&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)).\n\n3. Break down the volume into smaller pieces or a grid.\n\n4. Shoot back the sun-rays from the points and find how many of rays are block by each piece.\n\n5. Sort them based on the damage that they make and start removing from the most problematic ones.\n\n6. At some point you'll find the minimum number of cells that you need to remove to get your target number of hours for all the points on the surface.\n\n\n\nThis might be a little bit hard for a beginner to put together though. Give it a try and let us know if you can't figure it out yourself.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 20, 2017 at 3:18pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nCheck the attached definition for an example which follows the directions that I shared above.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/JtAF4oIzX0Syewe7ZVbZ*UhAEjJDC5WejBKcoFtNYpvapxelKXgBuJT3SXDJQy89u7PMUeyCTdYfJtEhkM04zyey8ydJc*e2/min_hours_geo.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/JtAF4oIzX0Syewe7ZVbZ*UhAEjJDC5WejBKcoFtNYpvapxelKXgBuJT3SXDJQy89u7PMUeyCTdYfJtEhkM04zyey8ydJc*e2/min_hours_geo.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1772324", "name": "find maximum geometry.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 21, 2017 at 7:43am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nIt looks very complex but I will do my best to figure it out.

I wanted to replace your geometry and test surface on mine, I added \"Bounding Box\", and now\u00a0I am trying to figure out how to\u00a0make\u00a0\"Inclusion test\". \u00a0But I don't understand why, when\u00a0I add a new \"test surface\" my file is crashing or the surface is totally yellow, and even I canoot see \"MeshRay\". I mean it looks like there is no problematic points. If you could check\u00a0my files\u00a0out and explain me how could I fix it I would be very grateful.<br/>I came to conclusion that maybe the problem is about the scale of my geometry, but I don't know.\n\n\n\nAlso I checked your orginal gh. file, I modyfied your surface and it's done\u00a0yellow too.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1777332", "name": "findmaximumgeometry_myTest.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1777333", "name": "test2.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1777334", "name": "POL_Gdansk.Port.Polnocny.121400_IMGW.epw"}], "created_by_name": "\u0141ukasz Dwulit", "created_at": "July 2, 2017 at 1:24pm", "created_by": "LukaszDwulit", "replies": []}]}]}
