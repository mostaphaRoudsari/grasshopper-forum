The analysis must be done for London whether.\u00a0\n\nI have attached the model and the gh definition to have a look.\u00a0\n\nI would appreciate it if somebody can help me.\n\n\n\nNicky\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1296815", "name": "ENERGY DEMANDS.rar"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1296816", "name": "energy analysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Nicky Nicolaou", "created_at": "May 27, 2015 at 11:39am", "created_by": "NickyNicolaou", "topic": "Help for energy simulation", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Nicky, Sorry for the late reply.
