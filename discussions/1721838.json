{"body": "\nHey guys,\n\n\n\nI use the Ladybug Radiation Analysis component and I get the radiation results(not the total\u00a0 result), it is a series of numbers, also the radiation is plotted on the geometry, but how can I find out which result corresponds to which mesh(or which part) of the analysis radiation?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBest,\n\nZhonghao\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pEYWotxu2NK5eeA8Yv3turuNqPfk2PhfwZP7AXmKGhH48V-YLPt6*dB0iOOV86uRc8bXl3Fw2IVLqaAL-FQGul6Sd*9lh1UE/result.png\" width=\"674\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pEYWotxu2NK5eeA8Yv3turuNqPfk2PhfwZP7AXmKGhH48V-YLPt6*dB0iOOV86uRc8bXl3Fw2IVLqaAL-FQGul6Sd*9lh1UE/result.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pEYWotxu2NLr2227S3UjhUgl6V7t8tigKVwvShSgC8HzefQBhoy06p-9uJQdSmOXrqV1KBF9BPMxA1cJT28OVVDvCx1OBeuJ/geometry.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pEYWotxu2NLr2227S3UjhUgl6V7t8tigKVwvShSgC8HzefQBhoy06p-9uJQdSmOXrqV1KBF9BPMxA1cJT28OVVDvCx1OBeuJ/geometry.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1721836", "name": "result.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1721837", "name": "geometry.png"}], "created_by_name": "Zhonghao Dai", "created_at": "March 27, 2017 at 7:52am", "created_by": "ZhonghaoDai", "topic": "The relation between radiation results and the geometry", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Zhonghao,\n\n\n\nYou can deconstruct mesh on your analysis mesh and iterate over the faces. I believe that HB will assign values in the same order as the mesh face order.\n\n\n\nOf course some times GH's ordering is a bit weird and I'm having also issues with this in cases where I want everything to follow a specific direction, e.g. x1y1, x2y1, x3y1, ..., xny1, x1y2, x2y2, x3y2, ...., where x, y are the length and width of the mesh.\n\n\n\nI wonder if Mostapha/Chris have an idea on how we can rearrange this with native GH or how we can have HB manually setting the order in this structured way.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 27, 2017 at 11:42pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nhey, Theodore,\n\nreally thanks for your reply.\n\nI will try it .\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zhonghao Dai", "created_at": "March 28, 2017 at 7:05am", "created_by": "ZhonghaoDai", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nIn addition to Theodoros's reply, you can also show on screen the results besides each surface.\n\nSee image:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SfnwKUqQ7eB-VyofsAbXzWLY1EHAGuvfE9hJg1Sd4w8fJfLuRO8w1Xyht-yeKa47El1kbsmrMaTZtoUKUudS5WvrCS3WcsE7/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SfnwKUqQ7eB-VyofsAbXzWLY1EHAGuvfE9hJg1Sd4w8fJfLuRO8w1Xyht-yeKa47El1kbsmrMaTZtoUKUudS5WvrCS3WcsE7/Capture.JPG)-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 28, 2017 at 4:38am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nHow can I show the results on each surface?\n\nIs the component also from Ladybug\uff1fSorry, I am quite new at it .\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zhonghao Dai", "created_at": "March 28, 2017 at 6:54am", "created_by": "ZhonghaoDai", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nSee attached example.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1722482", "name": "TEMP.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 28, 2017 at 8:27am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks a looooooot~~~~\n\nreally appreciate\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zhonghao Dai", "created_at": "March 28, 2017 at 8:31am", "created_by": "ZhonghaoDai", "replies": []}]}]}
