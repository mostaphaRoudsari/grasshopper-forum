As you see today Mostapha &amp; Co released the new version (0.54). In your picture you see that the LB_Ladybug is dated Feb 16 and the GenSky is Jan 3.\n\nI'm pretty sure this will do for you. Follow the update instructions in the main LB page.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 17, 2014 at 10:27pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nHa...

That's why it gives you this error. Remove the old component and use the new one and it should be all fine.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: Where did you find the component from the old version? Hopefully not from the new release or the example files?\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 17, 2014 at 10:29pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks, it had it in my previous Ladybug - it was not from the new release/ example files :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "WON HEE KO", "created_at": "February 18, 2014 at 11:40am", "created_by": "WONHEEKO", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1010878"}
