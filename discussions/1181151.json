{"body": "\nHi all!\n\nI am curious about how you guys create and/or edit your geometries for your analysis?\n\nI am not really familiar with the workflows in Rhino (yet) to create Breps for a building model. Is there a simple method to import floor plans (i.e. dxf files) and create 3-dimensional models from that?\n\nI personally like the simplicity of putting the geometry together Sketchup but the OpenStudio Plugin has its flaws when it comes to editing Spaces/Zones. Using Honeybee to create the zones from a model seems to work better, so what I am doing right now is:\n\n-importing a floor plan on Sketchup\n\n-trace the walls and extrude the faces\n\n-group the faces per zone\n\n-import in Rhino\n\n-set as Brep in Grasshopper\n\nThat seems to be working quite nicely, but not 100%. There are always some faces that are not being recognized correctly in terms of boundary conditions (after intersecting and solving adjacencies). Sometimes redrawing and reimporting that particular zone helps.\n\nBut what I would like to know as a Rhino noob if there are easier ways to get these things going in Rhino/Grasshopper and/or what kinds of limitations there might be with the Sketchup import.\n\nThanks in advance!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Albert Pressler", "created_at": "December 4, 2014 at 1:20pm", "created_by": "AlbertPressler", "topic": "Creating and editing Geometry", "replies": [{"body": "\nCreating it natively in Rhino will probably be your best option if you don't want to troubleshoot and correct geometry imports. \u00a0The main limitation is that you'll be importing Mesh surfaces from sketchup rather creating nurbs surfaces.

I usually manage it all in Grasshopper. Here is how I do it.\n\n1. Import 2D plans into Rhino, and put them in layers based on building program.\n\n2. Use Human plugin to import them into Grasshopper, extrude and cap them.\n\n3. Create HBZones and so on...\n\nIf your curves/lines are clean then solveAdj should work 100%. I know that it is not always the case - there is a tolerance input in solveAdj component that should help in many cases.\n\nIf you are still having cases that don't work, I will be happy to take a look.\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: I just found a bug in OpenStudio component for exporting custom constructions.

It is also worth mentioning that, if you haven't used them yet, we have a few components that can help you manage and format your geometry in the way that E+ likes (including components to split building masses into core/perimeter zones and a component to ensure that there are reciprocal matching surfaces of adjacent zones). \u00a0These 3 videos in the Honeybee Energy Modeling tutorial series should help you use them in your workflow:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDvBWDA0aF0&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDvBWDA0aF0&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=10)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DClON71RuuA&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DClON71RuuA&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=11)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMQ2Pau4q6c&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMQ2Pau4q6c&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=12)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 6, 2014 at 1:41am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}]}
