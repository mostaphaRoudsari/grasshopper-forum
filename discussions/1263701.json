I get the following error in the HB_runEnergySimulation:\n\n1. Solution exception:index out of range: 34\n\nBut is not important (for me). The answer to your question is becouse the zones are not conditioned. In the HB_createHBZones you defined the input as false.\n\nBut more important, i think, are you sure your geometry is correctly defined as for HB is concerned? In the group below the zone is OpenBrep (and it is supposed to be ClosedBrep). In the above group all is defined as untrimmed surfaces in the output of the zones definition.\n\nAlso there are no windows, but this is not a mayor one. technically it will work, but what kind of results are you expecting. Recommend you to check this. You want to have a \"good\" geometry and zone definition before you cary on with the simulations. Check (again) Chris's videos. They are great source.\n\n\n\nAs for the Optimization ... i need to understand what are you asking and think about it. I'll try to check this tomorrow.
