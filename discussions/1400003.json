{"body": "\nhi,\n\ni am doing a simutlation to assess the energy saving of an intelligient lighting system with daylight sensor. the control logic is when the\u00a0illumination\u00a0of 0.75m height plane exceed 500lux with daylight, the light will turn off. when the\u00a0illumination\u00a0of 0.75m height plane exceed 300lux but not reach 500lux with daylight, the light will turn on 50%. when the\u00a0illumination\u00a0of 0.75m height plane\u00a0drop below\u00a0300lux with daylight, the light will turn on 100%.\n\ncould anyone tell me\u00a0if Honeybee can do this kind of simulation. if it can, how?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chao jiang", "created_at": "November 13, 2015 at 11:18pm", "created_by": "Chaojiang", "topic": "energy saving simulate for intelligient lighting system with daylight sensor", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "November 14, 2015 at 12:14am", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chao,\n\nClaudio's paper should give you a very good picture on the workflow. However in your case since you're control logic is stepped you may need to apply the logic yourself by post-processing the results of an annual simulation.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 15, 2015 at 7:18am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1400003"}
