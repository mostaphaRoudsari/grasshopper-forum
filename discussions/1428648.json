{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\u00a0\n\nI have encountered an error using Honeybee. It showed \"the currently Honeybee is not compatible with the Energy Plus Folder on my system. Make sure you have EnergyPlus installed on your system...\" I have installed the Honeybee 0.0.58 along with Energy Plus 8-4-0 in Windows 10 system. I used the default directory.\n\nAfter going through some similar questions, I have tried to update the Ladybug and Honeybee. Another problem came regarding the ladybug update with the error message: \"Runtime Error (Win32Exception):WindowsErrorTraceback:line 230, in main, \u201c&lt;string&gt;\u201d line 248, in script.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s going wrong?
