{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nsorry to bother you again, this time I'm having a problem regarding a grid for a grid based analysis.\n\nI tried to use the grid generated by Honeybee but it's irregular, it essentially concentrates most of the points on some areas, which is not good since it'll prejudice the results.\n\nCan I use the Grasshopper DivideSurface instead? It is supposed to generate a grid defined by the user... I tried already but, once I input, the software showes an error saying \"Solution exception: 'None type' Object has no attribute 'transform' \", but the grid exists and has the same aspect (it's already simplified).\n\n\n\nAny suggestion?\n\n\n\nThank you all!\n\n\n\nSimone\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Simone Bevilacqua", "created_at": "January 5, 2016 at 11:06am", "created_by": "SimoneBevilacqua", "topic": "Honeybee GenTestPoints", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Simone,\n\nAre you cleaning the points generated by DivideSurface?
