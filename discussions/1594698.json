The version is for GHPython which is a Grasshopper plugin which you can download both from [food4Rhino](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/ghpython?ufh)\u00a0and [github](https://github.com/mcneel/ghpython/releases). You should be fine to use the most recent version with no issues.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 7, 2016 at 11:15am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI am aware of the difference between GHPython and Python.
