{"body": "\nHi all,\u00a0\n\nI am calculating the annual DGP for a given model from a certain point (attached file \"glare example step 1\"), from that calculation I figure out wich hour thoughout the year produces the highest DGP. Then I simulate the ilumimance image for that specific date, in this case the 1st of june at 08:00 (attached file \"glare example step 2\") to locate the glare patches. The problem is that the DGP value I get in the second simulation (0.22) is much lower than what the annual simulation predicted (1.00).\u00a0\n\nAm I doing something wrong? Shouldn't both simulations throw similar (if not identical) results?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nAle[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bgiO77bkViD1mfhqP68m-Ds0xzbxl0xU*WvosLeI7gxDS8BvoOkuERo5edl7MgOACOCGRv8GVYZQEFUhjN60rFxx9Yj*jQ*N/1.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bgiO77bkViD1mfhqP68m-Ds0xzbxl0xU*WvosLeI7gxDS8BvoOkuERo5edl7MgOACOCGRv8GVYZQEFUhjN60rFxx9Yj*jQ*N/1.JPG)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bgiO77bkViBumT1dXp6YsaivKC1vBk5spBFVrxXaE6QqzTNQOUp8wH*6OZGJy7J9M9yK6r4gIv1e2xeT69lhkp90BcNqCoCl/2.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bgiO77bkViBumT1dXp6YsaivKC1vBk5spBFVrxXaE6QqzTNQOUp8wH*6OZGJy7J9M9yK6r4gIv1e2xeT69lhkp90BcNqCoCl/2.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1436350", "name": "glare example step 1.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1436351", "name": "glare sxample step 2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "January 11, 2016 at 9:16am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Big discrepancies between annual DGP calculation and DGP from image", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Alejandro,\n\nEvery time that I show annual glare ti someone I warn him/her about the annual glare analysis and encourage them to cross reference the results. I don't think it's a mistake from your side. I have seen discrepancies too and stopped using the annual glare analysis but maybe both of us making a mistake!\n\nHave you tried to plot the annual results in 3DChart? Does it show a reasonable pattern?\n\nI would say this is a great question for Daysim email list. Jan is on the list and should be able to tell us why this is happening.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 11, 2016 at 6:34pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha,\u00a0\n\nThe annual parttern does make sense. It shows though a lot of ones, so it is hard to find out which of these ones would be the annual maximum. Yes, it would be good if someone from the Daysim mailing list would be able to give us an answer on this.\u00a0\n\nThanks for a quick answer.\u00a0\n\nAlejandro\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "January 12, 2016 at 12:38am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "replies": []}]}]}
