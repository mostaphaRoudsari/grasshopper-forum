I updated again, now it says so in the ReadMe and I got volumes between like 3-17m3/s again.\n\nAt this point I just stopped and calculated: Is it possible, that an airflow volume of 3-17m3/s in this case is not so unrealistic after all? It would mean, in the most extrem case, bit more 21km/h wind speed at the opening.\n\nWhat do you think?

You also might want to decrease this area further to account for other obstructions like insect screens (if you have them). \u00a0If you are mostly counting on the wind, it might also be a good idea to set the stackDischargeCoeff to 0. \u00a0So, in total, your wind speed is probably a bit less than what you currently have but I don't think that you are too far off.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 11, 2016 at 3:59pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks a lot!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julian Trummer", "created_at": "September 18, 2016 at 8:58am", "created_by": "JulianTrummer", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a thermal zone with 2 windows in the same size, one on the north wall, the other on the south wall, which fit the criteria of window-based wind-driven cross ventilation as you explained.\n\n\n\nMay I ask how to use two **setEPAirFlow** components **in tandem**, as you suggested, to specify the **_windowAngle2North**?\n\n\n\nI noticed that in your natural ventilation demo file on Hydra, there are three thermal zones, two of them have windows facing opposite directions.
