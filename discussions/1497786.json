{"body": "\nHello guys,\n\nIs it possible to get from any of the components from EnergyPlus the SHGC?\n\nI am trying to know how much is the contribution in terms of reduction of incoming solar energy of a group of shading devices in a window, by now I have been using with the TotalWindowEnergy output from the Eplus SurfaceReader, which by the way can only by annual, or is it possible to change it to specific time lapse, lets say for only 3 months?<br/><br/>Is total\u00a0TotalWindowEnergy my best option? <br/><br/>The output of the indicator will be lately used for a multi-objective optimization process.\n\nThe shading devices were generated by GH native components not by the HB Shade Generator.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCheers.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Luis E.
