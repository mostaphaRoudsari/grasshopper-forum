{"body": "\nHey guys,\n\n\n\nI am trying to get energy simulation of a building, I have set the whole model and parameters but once I run the simulation I get an error which I attached its picture, I have 61 zones overall and some of them randomly have invalid outside boundary condition. I have set the whole model right and it seems that my model is okay but I cannot find out what is the problem. And the thing is I want to set the model the way I did it and I can not simplify that because I wanted to assign interior windows and also different programs for different zones. I have attached the model and grasshopper file.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI would appreciate your help with my problem.\n\n\n\nLooking forward for your response.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1743378", "name": "energy model.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1743379", "name": "energysimulation.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1743380", "name": "photo_2017-04-30_23-58-57.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Mitra Sajjadi", "created_at": "April 30, 2017 at 10:03pm", "created_by": "MitraSajjadi", "topic": "Outside Boundry Condition Object Problem", "replies": [{"body": "\none thing I am not sure is the way I set solar chimneys.
