{"body": "\nDear bees and bugs, in the GH file attached the **monthly electricity demand** is not the same across different months although the zone loads and schedules are fixed (this can be seemed by the hourly electricity demand chart which is consistent across each day).\n\n\n\nMay I ask what might be causing this ?\n\n\n\nThis cause the problem that the **net purchased electricity** is not the difference between the **total electricity demand** and the **total electricity generated**. E.g. using Chicago's epw file, the electricity generated is 4717kWh, electricity demand is 4504kWh, and net purchased energy is 258kWh.\n\n\n\nAppreciate if you can point out any import things I miss here.\n\n\n\nThank you very much!\n\n- Ji\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/f6a-QIwO2RZLUIVFeuZR0EQ*1Mjxup6FWWVN-cAhTCoDZBxZy8XIhZxZ7j8vBpufRlZGjjpMqLQ3ny0g*x*B*bbbpQ3tEBAE/Picture1.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/f6a-QIwO2RZLUIVFeuZR0EQ*1Mjxup6FWWVN-cAhTCoDZBxZy8XIhZxZ7j8vBpufRlZGjjpMqLQ3ny0g*x*B*bbbpQ3tEBAE/Picture1.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1589913", "name": "pv generator issue.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 28, 2016 at 10:20am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "monthly electricity demand is not the same although zone loads and the schedules are fixed", "replies": [{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nThis seems to be happening because each month is not the same number of days. \u00a0Some months are 30 days long, others are 31 days and February is 28 days, which explains why it is smaller in the bar chart. \u00a0So the same schedule and loads are being used each day but it's just the number of days that is different.\n\nIf this does not account for all of the differences you are seeing, let me know and I can check out your GH file.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 28, 2016 at 10:35am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for pointing out the **absence of common sense** in my observation of the results :)\n\n\n\nHowever, it still begs the question that why the **annual total net purchased energy** (258kWh) is not equal to **annual total electricity demand** (4717kWh) minus **annual total energy generated on site through PV** (4504kWh), i.e 213kWh.\n\n\n\nOr is the net purchased energy is calculated in different way?\n\n\n\nAppreciate you kind advice.\u00a0\n\n<br/>Thank you!\n\n- Ji\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 28, 2016 at 8:58pm", "created_by": "Grasshope", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nJi,\n\nNo worries and I have also had several lapses in common sense going through the many outputs of E+. \u00a0I don't know about the PV issue and this is definitely a question for Anton who developed the HBgenerator components.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 29, 2016 at 5:53pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris, noted with thanks!
