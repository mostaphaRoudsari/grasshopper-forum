When I disable it I get reasonable results see the image below.\n\n\n\nI suggest that you do some research on the correct properties for ground surfaces and then set the radiance material at present you are simply using the default radiance material for the ground.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/EljNFT4PzFHpao9lsLXEUUMV7iGcA4PWyB*kTPFqomKpx9SxXl77CjBim1bSII5hIC-iNPr-xJhomENu6m7RhjJ7GitbQKlT/Planview.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/EljNFT4PzFHpao9lsLXEUUMV7iGcA4PWyB*kTPFqomKpx9SxXl77CjBim1bSII5hIC-iNPr-xJhomENu6m7RhjJ7GitbQKlT/Planview.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "May 12, 2016 at 4:50pm", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "replies": [{"body": "\nI'm not sure if it has anything to do with the ground. The error seems to be the result of co-planar surfaces in Radiance. The rays couldn't get in after a certain degree since they would see the wall and not the window. The glazing surface has not been removed from the wall successfully. You need to offset the edges of your window inside the parent surface if you want to use addHBGlz component.\n\nThe other approach is to split the surface in Rhino and assign the materials surface by surface.\n\nCheck the attached Rhino file.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1529289", "name": "GridBasedDaylightSimulationTest_msr.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 12, 2016 at 7:13pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nThank you for the answers.<br/>I used Mostapha's solution and it worked beutifully.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ejnar Brendsdal", "created_at": "May 17, 2016 at 5:10am", "created_by": "EjnarBrendsdal", "replies": []}]}
