{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI am trying to model a horizontal air wall in Honeybee (double height space) for an energy simulation.\n\nHowever, when I visualise the surface types after the energy simulation using the \"Decompose by type\" component it looks like Honeybee did not take into account the presence of the horizontal air wall.\n\nI read few previous posts on the topic and I am not sure whether it is possible to model horizontal air walls (even if I am sure there must be a way!).\n\n\n\nIs there anyone that could please advise on how to model correctly horizontal air walls in Honeybee?\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\n\nCarmelo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carmelo G.

So, according to what you are saying I should not get worried for this.\n\nDo you think it is appropriate to model a horizontal air wall using the \"standard\" air wall type usually used for the vertical condition? I mean that the air convection mechnism is different between the two cases, vertical and horizontal, and therefore also the mixing of the air should be different.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nCarmelo\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1584670", "name": "Air walls_Import IDF.png"}], "created_by_name": "Carmelo G.
