{"body": "\nI need to evaluate some historical weather data of a little village at Haiti. The only format I can get is XML, JSON or HTML. Is there a way how to feed that data to Ladybug and use it's tools to evaluate it?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now I can only read weather API and get data to Grasshopper using gHowl.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI also found it's possible to create custom epw data file using this SW\u00a0[http://bigladdersoftware.com/projects/elements/](http://bigladdersoftware.com/projects/elements/) but have no idea if it works.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny suggestions?

If you upload the XML, we might be able to help you more.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, if you download your historical data from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC):\n\n[https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/maps/ncei/cdo/hourly](https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/maps/ncei/cdo/hourly)\n\n... I've written a small component to format the downloaded data into an EPW (assuming that you have an existing nearby EPW to start with).\n\n\n\nThe component is under the Dragonfly beta and you can download it here:\n\n[https://github.com/chriswmackey/Dragonfly/raw/master/userObjects/Dr...](https://github.com/chriswmackey/Dragonfly/raw/master/userObjects/Dragonfly_AMY%20from%20NCDC%20Data.ghuser)\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 6, 2017 at 4:48am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}], "id": "1778931"}
