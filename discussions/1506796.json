{"body": "\nHi\u00a0\n\nI am new at grasshopper and honeybee/ladybug :)\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have a problem with my illuminance file - the lux values are way too high. Could it be a problem with my assigned materials? I have previously had problems with materials - is it possible that I am missing a material database on my computer?\n\n\n\nAny help is highly appreciated - many thanks!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/dk-AyGBsVPDuA2Zut86o7KGDEHcxtZ0Nliv1n4nvyxZWsOq*XxC6YtFbrPyEmdRGw6vsLb1UfvGBtsdZuf3Q**Vc7yzpXTsA/ScreenShot20160412at12.42.34PM.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/dk-AyGBsVPDuA2Zut86o7KGDEHcxtZ0Nliv1n4nvyxZWsOq*XxC6YtFbrPyEmdRGw6vsLb1UfvGBtsdZuf3Q**Vc7yzpXTsA/ScreenShot20160412at12.42.34PM.png)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1506794", "name": "illuminanceAnalysis.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1506795", "name": "illuminanceAnalysis_honeybee.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Sara L.
