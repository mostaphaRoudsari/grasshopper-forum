And make sure that your file path does not have any spaces in them. Radiance does not play well with files that have spaces in them, partly because of the fact that the default delimiter in Radiance is whitespace.\n\n\n\nSarith\n\n\n\n(PS: I don't do energy simulations, so I have no idea about how to replicate this workflow in E+ )\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "August 22, 2016 at 12:45pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you Sarith!\n\nThat's the process I was following, but I had changed the default path of the file to a different folder which wasn't recognized.
