The video showed that it could perform simulation when the building form was rotated. But when I do that, some of the window surfaces will be disappeared. However, when I turn the angle to a higher value, the surface will show again. Does honeybee could only work during some rotate angles?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/YsTyeLVttoihrvZJwgpGIEWda*pGstc-2etnLznn3L0aNnvsW3V0DFJMt9ISzuRZtx3BE3ufm*vco9dEGu--apOjJXYQ8pdB/QQ20141212004003.jpg\" width=\"525\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/YsTyeLVttoihrvZJwgpGIEWda*pGstc-2etnLznn3L0aNnvsW3V0DFJMt9ISzuRZtx3BE3ufm*vco9dEGu--apOjJXYQ8pdB/QQ20141212004003.jpg)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/YsTyeLVttojGSDmUrV3n4XWsaIttt5gPv4PnjeRCD6KpEEF3leko0xI5NEOl4GwBpSgEm3LC2Jgrj2QjCSvmeftch1ghzSlk/QQ20141212004104.jpg\" width=\"549\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/YsTyeLVttojGSDmUrV3n4XWsaIttt5gPv4PnjeRCD6KpEEF3leko0xI5NEOl4GwBpSgEm3LC2Jgrj2QjCSvmeftch1ghzSlk/QQ20141212004104.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Han Yunsong", "created_at": "December 11, 2014 at 4:43pm", "created_by": "HanYunsong", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Han,\n\nI need your file to check.
