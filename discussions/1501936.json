{"body": "\nHello everybody,\n\n\n\nI'm a beginner on Ladybug. I have been practising Ladybug by watching all videos on Youtube. But there is a small problem showed up. When I was setting up point for textpoints, the points which were supposed to show up on the Rhino didn't show up and I thought It's probably because\u00a0I didn't link sunvetors but, after I linked sunvectors to Sunlight Hours Analysis, the programme stopped working. I don't know how to solve this one. I'm currently using 0.0.62 ver and the lastest one of grasshopper.
