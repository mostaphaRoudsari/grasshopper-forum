Specifically, the component writes a THERM version of the EP Material into the THERM library that is stored in memory just like the HBSrf component writes the new custom material/construction into the EP Library in memory.\n\nWhen you have another HB_HB flying on another GH canvass or you drag/drop a newr HB_HB onto the canvass, it overwrites all of the materials that you have written to this library in the memory of the Rhino document. \u00a0Accordingly, to ensure that you do not encounter this error, I would either not have multiple GH files open for a given Rhino document or, if you do, hit recompute whenever you get this type of warning to ensure that the GH document re-writes all of the materials/constructions into the library.\n\nMostapha, if you read this, I think that we really need to find some way around this overwriting of libraries in Honeybee. \u00a0If this issue has confused Abraham a couple of times, that I am positive that it has confused the great majority of the HB user base. \u00a0I have started a github issue for it here and please let me know your thoughts:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/446](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/446)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 4, 2016 at 7:52am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThis was EXACTLY like you described.
