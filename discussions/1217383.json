{"body": "\nHi, I have to problems with the attached definition\n\n1. How do you input a geometry for the shadow study component in ladybug? I had a rhino geometry that I set as as reference brep, which I guess it doesn't work. I looked at your sample file and your geometry was a close brep, if that the problem, how do you convert a rhino geometry into a close brep?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pPSIfXxESuyxCCmMcpLUMMR*Lxd34k2Y9Xfzz-cGohAzHifT5sUtvKfvRG7qs-IvphtLNqCKoYc6Gpn3SYSDz8IBIeaWb2VM/0..JPG?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pPSIfXxESuyxCCmMcpLUMMR*Lxd34k2Y9Xfzz-cGohAzHifT5sUtvKfvRG7qs-IvphtLNqCKoYc6Gpn3SYSDz8IBIeaWb2VM/0..JPG)\n\n2. In the sunlight hours component, I'm getting less than 1 hour of sun on a horizontal surface with no obstructions on June 22 at noon in Dallas, TX.

It seems to be similar to shade benefit evaluation, so only surfaces will do (i.e. no meshes or polysurfaces on the brep geometry). You seem to have one polysurface selected (the right side of your building). I changed that to a simple surface and it seems to work.\n\n\n\nI'm attaching the files. By the way I changed the weather file and took away some of the inputs, you should revert to your settings.\n\n\n\nEdit: By works I meant the error is not showing anymore. Not really sure it works as I haven't used any of these components yet.\n\n\n\nHope this works.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1217625", "name": "ShadowStudy_test_surfaces.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1217626", "name": "SolarStudy_HZ_extruded_surface.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 4, 2015 at 8:09pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nHelena,\n\nThat shadow study component is under the WIP tab for a good reason. \u00a0It's very difficult to geometrically calculate vector shadows and I would only use that component for simple geometries like small numbers of boxes and planes. \u00a0With geometry as complex as you have there, you are easily going to make your computer crash if you try to get it to work. \u00a0I would instead suggest going with a raster-based method using the sunlight hours component.\n\nSingle Hour:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hMNECPNor991wm07Qr2Cizp4xWtdiKeSvXrn2kel*kbkoCV*OZTe9FHAiCN4wEZgW1oM7nDHMl6l3dXq828Q9pbNeAy4kd1a/SingleHour.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hMNECPNor991wm07Qr2Cizp4xWtdiKeSvXrn2kel*kbkoCV*OZTe9FHAiCN4wEZgW1oM7nDHMl6l3dXq828Q9pbNeAy4kd1a/SingleHour.PNG)\n\nOver a day:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hMNECPNor9*ypF5E-JW7qdzyu8v3iaabM0BhdVLDX1DzixSQPPbUiCqrd2Ul1KfeyGhNkB*IkT814WGK8K3QCNlW62z9CD-t/OveraADay.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hMNECPNor9*ypF5E-JW7qdzyu8v3iaabM0BhdVLDX1DzixSQPPbUiCqrd2Ul1KfeyGhNkB*IkT814WGK8K3QCNlW62z9CD-t/OveraADay.PNG)\n\nSee example GH file attached.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1219003", "name": "ShadowStudy_testCWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 5, 2015 at 6:38pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you Chris!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Helena Zambrano", "created_at": "February 6, 2015 at 10:08am", "created_by": "HelenaZambrano", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHelena,\n\nFor point 2 i suggest to flip the normal direction of the ground surface.

I'm also a little confused because in the file you attached to your response the brep geometry that is working is seems to be a curve, not a surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor point 2, I checked the surface normals and the surface is pointing upwards. I also try flipping the surface, and the result was no sun hours at all, so I deleted it, made a new surface, check the normals, and I still only get 1 hour of sun on a horizontal surface during the summer in Texas.\u00a0\n\n[\u00a0](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nNOqzuU--h9XlOfMyAuIGpM59ujrWht6EN8SaswhTwcCSEsLKKy813j5wIfCwPSXnkqaCU7VOGEIaw26P7mrLN0N8bO9KKET/surfacenormals.JPG)\n\nPlease see attached images.
