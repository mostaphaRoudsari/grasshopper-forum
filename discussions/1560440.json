{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\nI\u00a0have another question for you!! Is there a way to plot the Zone Windows Total Transmitted Solar Radiation Rate in the model? (as you can do for the operative temperature through the Microclimate Map Analysis component).\n\nBecause i have been using till now the 3D Chart (image attached)\u00a0but through that component the result is not directly related to the model.\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia\n\n<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KVPUZlOxrTFKmckgeRNa3TKKfnA9bKCm297JkoZ0cbEMvQiXuQLExNrZZoZcvFpM53zpqswRHH3trbBke60*tma8pQj95rIz/Z.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "July 5, 2016 at 9:19am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "How to plot the Transmitted Solar Radiation", "replies": [{"body": "\nYou can color each window based on transmitted radiation.
