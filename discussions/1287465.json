{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI think there is an error in the component description of RTRadiationAnalysis.

Should it be kWh/m2?\n\nAs a comparison, the output 'radiationOutput' in component 'radiationAnalysis' returns values in kWh/m2 too, which is why I think it should be kWh/m2 in both components.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James Ramsden", "created_at": "May 15, 2015 at 7:49am", "created_by": "JamesRamsden", "topic": "Error in radiation component description", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi James, Thank you for letting us know.
