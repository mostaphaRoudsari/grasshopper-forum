{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI recently started to go into more detailed energy simulations with HB due to a project. I had a question (in a long line of questions to come I'm sure :( ) about the natural ventilation component.\n\n\n\nI apologize if this is quite trivial. In the natural ventilation type, there is an option for mechanical (fan-driven) ventilation (which is what interests me atm). The tooltip requests a design flow rate for the area. Is this done through the \"Set EP Zone Loads\" component and the ventilationperArea option? And what would happen (i.e what would be the default option) if I simply input a ventilationperArea without using the NV component?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 29, 2015 at 9:45pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Natural Ventilation Component", "replies": [{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nSorry for the late reply. \u00a0I think that starting with fan driven ventilation is a good idea as the window-based auto-calculations are fairly simple at the moment and really only good for a few zones at a time (we're currently working on implementing the whole airflow network, which will allow you to evaluate really complicated cases). \u00a0To clarify, you set the _fanFlowRate on the set EP Airflow component here:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-FxrWMrAPzgXXFIljp1SATv-uLyvQj5b2GNlKXCSQzjgA6mODUJfAgt3kF0EL11VMxhmT5mlMz79Avp0jb*X1PXqgEwUcoPa/FanFlowRate.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-FxrWMrAPzgXXFIljp1SATv-uLyvQj5b2GNlKXCSQzjgA6mODUJfAgt3kF0EL11VMxhmT5mlMz79Avp0jb*X1PXqgEwUcoPa/FanFlowRate.JPG)\n\nThis flow rate is meant to be the total outdoor air flow rate in m3/s that you want to enter the zone when the indoor temperature rises above the \"minIndoorTempForNatVent_\" (it is not divided by the floor area). \u00a0This fan flow is completely separate from the\u00a0\"Set EP Zone Loads\" component, in which case the\u00a0ventilationperArea values that you input here refer to the minimum outdoor air that you want to come in through the mechanical ideal air heating/cooling system. \u00a0Iif your zone is not conditioned, these ventilationperArea values will have no effect. \u00a0The minimum ventilationperArea\u00a0is built into the default ideal air systems to ensure that the occupants do not suffocate or (more likely) smell each other's body odors. \u00a0In contrast, the fan-driven natural ventilation on the\u00a0set EP Airflow component is done to cool down the space instead of using a traditional mechanical cooling system.\n\nLet me know if this clarifies everything.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 3:51pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for the response. I admit it frustrates me how novice I am in energy plus. Just a couple of questions if I may. You say that ventilationperArea (in the ep zone loads) will have no effect if the zone is not conditioned. My interest mainly here is to set up mechanical ventilation in non-conditioned zones (e.g. warehouse spaces). By your description this seems to be the case of fandrivenventilation in the NatVent component. Would that be a right guess? And could I input a schedule for this type of ventilation somewhere in honeybee (sorry can't check the component in this pc right now).\n\n\n\nFinally, what would the EP settings assigned to zones in models where only simple parameters were set? For example, what happens to a zone I only assign as non-conditioned in the create zone component? Is it assigned any type of ventilation by EP? Again, I promise I'll go for some EP training so that I won't bother you so much with technical questions!\n\n\n\nThank you so much!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 6:58pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nYour assumptions are correct. \u00a0This is the component that you should use to set up fan ventilation in an unconditioned warehouse. You will see an openingAreaFractionalSchedule on the Nat Vent / Air Flow component and you can use this to set the fraction of fan power that you want applied at each hour (if you use the CSV schedule component to make a schedule for the fan). \u00a0You can also just use the more common situation of having the fans turn on when the indoor temperature rises above a certain minIndoorTempforNatVent.\n\nIf the zones are unconditioned, the only airflow going into the zone infiltration, which is usually very small by default (just the air that flows through small cracks in the walls). \u00a0So your default unconditioned zones will probably overheat a lot.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 7:47pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHey Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for the response!

After setting up the fan driven ventilation in the component, do I input it in the set ep zone loads component to set up the ventilation rate or is that not required. I know how much the total zone air flow should be but I'm not sure if I should input that in the fan flow rate or in the ventilationperarea of the zone.\n\n\n\nAs a side note, is there an ideal load mechanical ventilation system? Ugh, I know the previous sentence might be terribly wrong but I wonder if there is an easy, EP default, way of setting up MV flow rates in different spaces.
