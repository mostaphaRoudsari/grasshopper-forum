Since Radiance is a stochastic ray tracing engine, there will always be some rays that undergo total internal reflection.\n\nI once had an\u00a0[online discussion](https://unmethours.com/question/11541/how-does-one-correct-errors-related-to-truncated-images/?answer=11571#post-id-11571) with Greg Ward\u00a0 about this. I am pasting the relevant excerpt below:\n\n\n\nIs there a way to debug or track a rendering processes during runtime ie to know if it will render at all ? Secondly, is there a likelihood of something like total internal reflection happening and light rays not escaping ?\n\nThe progress reports are the best way to make sure that the renderings are progressing, which they seemed to be doing until they got killed. Even in cases where total internal reflection prevents rays escaping, the tracing will hit some limit (either -lw or -lr and setting both to 0 will give an error) to prevent an infinite loop. Believe me, if there were any infinite loops in Radiance, people would be complaining about it!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "February 22, 2016 at 9:50pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you Mostapha and Sarith\n\nI also predicted the effect of total internal refraction inside the water layer. and I actually wanted to simulate this effect. and I am pretty sure that I need more than 6 as ab_ parameter.\u00a0\n\nwhat can I do?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Fazel Ganji", "created_at": "February 23, 2016 at 4:38am", "created_by": "fazelganji", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nOK, I replaced the layers of Trans material with Glass (for layers) and kept the Dielectric Water. now it is working for ab 1 to 6.\u00a0\n\nas you said Trans are very hungry :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Fazel Ganji", "created_at": "February 23, 2016 at 7:21am", "created_by": "fazelganji", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Fazel,\n\n\n\nI would be careful about replacing materials (especially if it is for an actual project).
