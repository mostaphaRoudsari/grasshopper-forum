{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am trying to build a residencial building diferenciating the core from the apartment areas, I've drawn the geometry in many different ways and multiple times but I can get the Solve adjacencies to work properly and identify all the interior walls. I assume it is a geometry problem but I even draw from points to make sure the corners matched and still nothing.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions?
