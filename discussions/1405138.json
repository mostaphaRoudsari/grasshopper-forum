Just a warning that if you're creating the sky for a non-cloudy day then using the second method is not recommended. You can use watch the sky component to check the illuminance value under the generated sky. A good place to start is probably the weather data around the time that you have done the measurement:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bSwfCDfF4Fa4okebsOm*as*JwV8nkXmJuCdXn18qYiJYgw5ofbzxm1tTDt6zulpDFs7KEGy-ZjeIMb5tR3-2PbkJn52cUI7M/customWeatherFile.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bSwfCDfF4Fa4okebsOm*as*JwV8nkXmJuCdXn18qYiJYgw5ofbzxm1tTDt6zulpDFs7KEGy-ZjeIMb5tR3-2PbkJn52cUI7M/customWeatherFile.png)\n\n\n\nIf you have an HDR image of the sky there are more advanced solutions that you can find on the web.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1405846", "name": "customWeatherFile.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 5:02pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nthanks alot mostafa!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "masoumehta", "created_at": "November 21, 2015 at 2:09pm", "created_by": "masoumehta", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1405138"}
