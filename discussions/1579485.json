{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am working with new version of Honeybee. I make a very simple zone and wanted to test it. When I run the file, its results are annually, but I want the hourly results. I change the timestep in the into the hourly, monthly and daily, but the results are annually again! I open EnergyPlus file to check the variables, and all of the frequencies of the variables are annual.\u00a0\n\nWhat is the problem of my Honeybee?\n\nThanks alot.\n\nRegards,\n\nHelia Taheri\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Helia Taheri", "created_at": "August 9, 2016 at 10:57pm", "created_by": "HeliaTaheri", "topic": "My Honeybee always simulates annually and gives me only one value!", "replies": [{"body": "\nHelia,\n\nIt sounds like you just have to disconnect the \"annually\" input from the \"Generate EP Output\" component. \u00a0If that's not working, upload a GH file with the issue.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 9, 2016 at 11:05pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nChris,\n\nAt first I want to thank from you for your very useful video tutorials on Honeybee energy modeling.
