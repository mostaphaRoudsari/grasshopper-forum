If it is not possible, try with a part of it and when you are sure and all it is fine, run the complete model. Moreover, for the first tests of your model I suggest that you use a big gridSize, e.g. 10 meters.\n\n\n\nLet me know if it works\n\n\n\n- Antonello\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1692622", "name": "LB_sunLightHours_DNA.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "February 15, 2017 at 3:00pm", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Antonello.
