Thank you.\n\nAlso in order to not consider reflections I set changed all the RAD Materials to be 0 reflecting mirrors using the radMirrorMaterial and setRADMaterials components. I did this so I can neglect all reflections in this study. Heres my results below:<br/><br/>[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/t*8vNS4hPCH*nYQE5scCcByyxfuQTzmTZvl8-MRaKy-hcjVuH3cudkLFgZ2W9V-kdVyk8DuimoJAnBsf*Ebmd9G7aBaGohf7/reflections.PNG\" width=\"469\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/t*8vNS4hPCH*nYQE5scCcByyxfuQTzmTZvl8-MRaKy-hcjVuH3cudkLFgZ2W9V-kdVyk8DuimoJAnBsf*Ebmd9G7aBaGohf7/reflections.PNG)What you see in this picture is a large floor, and an inclined cube with a shielding cap on it. All surfaces are supposed to be non reflecting. I get 0 W/m^2 on the top and bottom faces (as expected) However, I get ~2 W/m^2 just above the red patch (expected to be 0) and also ~20 W/m^2 on the two sides opposite of the red patches (expected to be 0). Any ideas what is causing this? There must be some sort of reflection going on - perhaps it is the sky model that is generated? Even though I specified 0 diffuse radiation, maybe reflections from the sun are occuring? This is ok if it is the case, but I would like to read about the sky model being used so I know what assumptions are being made. Thank you Mostapha. This is truly an amazing tool you are developing!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mike Johnson", "created_at": "April 4, 2017 at 2:06pm", "created_by": "MikeJohnson", "replies": []}]}]}
