{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI have installed HBLB (step by step how written in your guide) and when I've checked if it run with **Honeybee_honeybee!** I've found the warning in the figure.

Why are you concerned about ladybug problems?\n\n\n\nBack to Honeybee, the error happens when the component tries to create the folder c:\\ladybug on your system. I assume you have already the folder created on your system (since Ladybug is running fine). If not can you create c:\\ladybug manually and try again?\n\n\n\nI have never seen this error before. Let me know if it solves the issue.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 5, 2014 at 8:22pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThe folder doesn't exist although ladybug says me **Default path is set to c:/ladybug.**\n\nThen I've created it manually and I've found an alike error\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UZ8UQ2FXhhPHuoSr5F1shmkoFsh-bZkMC*1yUvzVpaD80pCaCjtHK3mplT0QUrkSeQZV3Tjckd*vXflLmjEbO-BsaLONM4Xb/error3.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UZ8UQ2FXhhPHuoSr5F1shmkoFsh-bZkMC*1yUvzVpaD80pCaCjtHK3mplT0QUrkSeQZV3Tjckd*vXflLmjEbO-BsaLONM4Xb/error3.PNG)PS: ladybug is still working with the new folder.\n\n\n\nGiuseppe\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "May 6, 2014 at 1:15am", "created_by": "GiuseppeDM", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi\u00a0Giuseppe,\n\nLooks like your account doesn't have writing permissions to C: drive.\n\n\n\nThis is strange as I already check the user permissions inside the component and try to introduce a new path but for some reason it doesn't work on your system.\n\n\n\nWe have to fix this step by step. We had a similar discussion with\u00a0[Wim](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/how-to-get-radiance-and-daysim-installed?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1025188&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\u00a0before and he solved it by creating a folder for Ladybug that he had writing permission. Is it also a possibility for you?\n\n\n\nI put a component together that prints your permissions. Do you want to give it a try and let me know the results? On your system it will probably return False for write, and execute. Let me know the results and we will figure out how to get it solved.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UZ8UQ2FXhhM*GSgu76zII5aDI1XHFZunTbirM3kwf5wjSHPiQsmdREN5u6UlqygLh7Sh-iZdQ7QiLwhbs1CbAtQ*cgks8ozP/testAccess.png\" width=\"483\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UZ8UQ2FXhhM*GSgu76zII5aDI1XHFZunTbirM3kwf5wjSHPiQsmdREN5u6UlqygLh7Sh-iZdQ7QiLwhbs1CbAtQ*cgks8ozP/testAccess.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1065371", "name": "testAccess.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 6, 2014 at 6:35am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nmaybe I have good news.\u00a0Giving the full permission at the user to modify the ladybug directory I've found this result although the testAccess.gh gives a false for F\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/*tHd*uipNJB5i7ky8Qbj7oX6hIq884Iivwu4KLqAGN*o62VnzeOruWE3fm3r0Du-dz*jvSQxawmZsV3iupbmqxptxauSEuM1/Cattura.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/*tHd*uipNJB5i7ky8Qbj7oX6hIq884Iivwu4KLqAGN*o62VnzeOruWE3fm3r0Du-dz*jvSQxawmZsV3iupbmqxptxauSEuM1/Cattura.PNG)thanks for your help\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "May 7, 2014 at 7:37am", "created_by": "GiuseppeDM", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Giuseppe,\n\nThank you for keep trying.
