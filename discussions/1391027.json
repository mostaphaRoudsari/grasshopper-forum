I have read that there are two methods to set the blinds schedules:\n\n- 1. When there are 50w/m2 on the window\n\n- 2. When there is more than 40% of the interior sensors that surpasses a certain illuminance threshold.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI think I figured out how to do the second option (see picures below)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SJHyuKr55TPLOgPrWy4QcN9ME0OM9BSmtuUV4PvDfZmshaNIJc85QJmsQD5LzwOm-Lb0Qtg4D3rpXGybzSputR1*FQl6X1gR/Capture2.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SJHyuKr55TPLOgPrWy4QcN9ME0OM9BSmtuUV4PvDfZmshaNIJc85QJmsQD5LzwOm-Lb0Qtg4D3rpXGybzSputR1*FQl6X1gR/Capture2.PNG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SJHyuKr55TMdToWwwj9MX4lryTYkrArKkfbSpjun1gKgIsJi-wBdZtVTdyvjtvpRkWUcakjxpk7xp5V4DuOByTgjJw8RdLum/Capture.PNG?width=750\" width=\"454\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SJHyuKr55TMdToWwwj9MX4lryTYkrArKkfbSpjun1gKgIsJi-wBdZtVTdyvjtvpRkWUcakjxpk7xp5V4DuOByTgjJw8RdLum/Capture.PNG)\n\n\n\nBut what about the first one? how can I set the exterior sensor to check for the 50W/m2 on the window?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nAlejandro\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "November 2, 2015 at 5:24am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Set the shading schedule with Daysim/Honeybee", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Alejandro,\n\n\n\nYou should use Glare control recipe to introduce external sensor.

I mean even if I take out a lighting schedule from UDI analysis, it will be difficult to get the corresponding change in my cooling energy use. Any thoughts on this?

If so, you can create shading using E+ shading creator component and set the control type. Although there is no radiation threshold as there is in E+.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf you want to run an Annual daylight simulation and want to simulate lighting sensors, you can create lighting control group using the component of same name and set a threshold. This component works on the basis of illuminance. So, there is a difference of metric. Once, the annual simulation is run, you can extract the lighting schedule and feed it in to your E+ simulation.\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n\nAll the best,\n\nRam\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ram Joshi", "created_at": "September 4, 2016 at 10:19pm", "created_by": "RamJoshi", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nDear Ram\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply, this helps but I am not going to use the results in E+, I was thinking to run annual radiation on the facade and then create\u00a0External shading schedule for daysim based on radiation thresholds. but I am not sure where to input\u00a0External shading schedule \u00a0in HoneyBee, Do you have any idea?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ata Chokhachian", "created_at": "September 5, 2016 at 2:28am", "created_by": "AtaChokhachian", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n<u>External shading schedule\u00a0<u><u>(<u>control keyword =\u00a0<u><u><u>AnnualShadingSchedule</u></u></u>)</u></u></u></u>:\u00a0Daysim uses an external shading file that detemrines the status of the dynamic shading systems at every hour in the year.
