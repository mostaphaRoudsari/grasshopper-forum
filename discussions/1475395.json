{"body": "\nHello !\n\n\n\nI'm trying to map the total radiation over an urban scene on the sun path diagram (in the same fashion as you would do with global horizontal radiation, let say). My problem is, I can't generate a valid annual hourly data set.\n\n\n\nI've tried to fake the header and use intersection matrix, but you have to generate 8760 sky matrix, which is way too much for my poor computer. Same if input a grafted 1-8760 series into the radiation analysis, and read the totalRadiation output.\n\n\n\nAny idea on how to do this cleanly ? I'd like to avoid animating a slider, write a file and read it back, as far as possible. I have nothing against an Honeybee solution though.\n\n\n\nThanks !\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Etienne Burdet", "created_at": "March 2, 2016 at 1:21am", "created_by": "EtienneBurdet", "topic": "Radiation on Sunpath ?
