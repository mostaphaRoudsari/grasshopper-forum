{"body": "\nHi LB and HB devs and experts.\n\nI have some questions regarding setting up ventilation systems in HB.\n\nPlease see the Grasshopper file to understand the questions properly.\n\nThe questions are grouped\u00a0by a green blob.\n\n\n\n1) Question 1. Changing my **ventilationPerArea** does not affect my thermal environment why?\u00a0\n\n2)\u00a0Question 2. How do I define my own schedules? for heating and cooling set point schedules specifically.\n\n3) Question 3.\u00a0How do I define my system (heating and cooling) capacities is it possible?\n\n4)\u00a0Question 4. It seems like Adiabatic Surface proprieties disappear when written to EP. Am I doing something wrong?\n\n\n\nBest Regards\n\nKristoffer\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1176573", "name": "testRoomQ.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Kristoffer Negendahl", "created_at": "November 27, 2014 at 4:59am", "created_by": "KristofferNegendahl", "topic": "Questions about schedules and system capacities", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Kristoffer,\n\nQ1. Check this discussion:\u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/ventilation...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/ventilation-rate-does-not-affect-the-heating-energy-needs)\n\nQ2. Check this discussion:\u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-material...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-material-construction-schedule-library)\n\nQ3. You need to use the OpenStudio export for that. There are 10 template systems that you can select from them. All the components are under tab number 10. Looks for Honeybee_OpenStudioHVACSystems. I'm not sure if we have an example file for that but I can put one together for you if that helps.\n\nQ4. This can be a bug. I will check the attached file and update this discussion.\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 27, 2014 at 9:19pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHere is the update:\n\nQ2. Sorry! I should have opened your file before answering to this question. The issue is not actually the schedule but SetPt. I need to take a closer look. I recently used this functionality and it was working totally fine. There is some issues with adding the schedule to library. Should be an easy fix.\n\nQ4. It exports the surfaces fine and the boundary condition is correct in exported file which means results of your analysis should be fine. importIdf is incapable of importing the boundary condition correct. I added an issue to get it fixed: [https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/220](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/220)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 27, 2014 at 9:37pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nBack to Q2, updating to the latest version solved the issue. The reason that the analysis fails when you use .csv file for heating setpoint schedule is that EnergyPlus is looking for a dualsetpoint schedule. If you use the same file for other schedules (e.g. occupancy) it will run fine. I will check about the possibility of generating custom .csv schedules for a case like this. I attached the updated file we should work fine with setpoints.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1177001", "name": "testRoomQ_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 28, 2014 at 12:46am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mustapha I am grateful and really impressed how fast your responses are.\u00a0\n\nQ1. Makes totally sense now. The updated user objects gives me reasonable answers now. Also nice to see the hints on units. Neat.\u00a0\n\nQ2. OK I see Occupancy, Activity, Lighting, Equipment, Infiltration are working fine. But Heating and Cooling does not at the moment. Could you provide me with a sample dualpoint csv file, or where the standard files are placed, I might just cook something up to make HB happy here.\n\nQ3. I really like to see examples of using HB+LB+OpenStudio especially when it comes to controlling heating and cooling capacities. If you (or Chien Si)\u00a0have some messy test/example files, just send them to me (kristoffer.negendahl[at]gmail[dot]com) and I can spend some time cleaning and comment them out and place the here for future reference. In general I really like to see more examples of manipulation of systems.\n\nQ4.

It might be a good question for unmethours.com website actually as it is more of an EnergyPlus related question, than Honeybee question. I can also check for it if I get a chance.\n\nQ3. I leave this one to Chien Si ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/222](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/222)).\n\nQ4. This is fixed now.
