{"body": "\nHi Chris, hi all,\n\nfirst of all thank you for the continuous development of Ladybug and Honeybee tools, they are great!\n\nI'm working on the energy simulation for a greenhouse at the top of a skyscraper. The space will be naturally ventilated and I need to run a few simulations to understand its thermal behaviour.\n\nI've started creating the Honeybee Zone but I'm struggling with the definition of the different windows' typologies. In fact, some of them are openable and some of them fixed (see attached image) and I would like to differenciate them in my definition. Is there a way to do it so to correctly set up \"Honeybee_Set EP Airflow\" later on?\n\nThank you for your help!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1776711", "name": "HoneybeeZoning.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Andrea Rossi", "created_at": "June 30, 2017 at 4:36am", "created_by": "AndreaRossi772", "topic": "Energy Simulation - Differentiate Fixed and Openable Windows", "replies": []}
