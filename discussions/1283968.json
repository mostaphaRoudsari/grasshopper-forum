{"body": "\nHey everyone,\n\n\n\nI have been dabbing with OS and Honeybee lately (thanks for the amazing videos!) and I have a quite simple, rookie, question.\n\n\n\nWill OS components override the settings provided during the designing of HB zones in the previous steps? For now, I've been dragging my zones from the solve adjacencies component to OS and then setting the HVAC options. Should I split the zones into multiple OS components to handle AC zones, NV zones, MV zones, etc.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 10, 2015 at 10:00pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Honeybee and OpenStudio interface - interactions and parameter settings during an E+ simulation", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi again,\n\n\n\nStill don't seem to be able to understand how I can simulate a number of zones that have air-conditioned and non air-conditioned spaces. I am testing now and it seems that OS overrides the false option on the create HBzone component, which seems logical given the brief description that was given in the videos.\n\n\n\nI tried bypassing the OS systems component and linking the unconditioned zones into the OS simulation component but that only predictably applied ideal air loads (I assume, since the whole area was conditioned again in the OS tabular report). Perhaps I am understanding this workflow in a wrong way? Or perhaps there are some details I can add in order to incorporate non conditioned areas? Would a solution be to pass the non conditioned zones through an orchestrator with only the airside details set?\n\n\n\nEdit: It seems that in the simulation where all the zones were passed through the orchestrator the mechanical ventilation rates per area set in the \"Set Energy Plus Zone Loads\" component prior were applied. This means that my mechanical ventilation settings were passed on to OS but still the zones become conditioned which I'd like to avoid.\n\n\n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 12, 2015 at 8:14pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}], "id": "1283968"}
