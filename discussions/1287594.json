{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI need HELP from someone can double check if this workflow is correct.I want to build one zone room(see picture) and optimize the shape of the external wall and percentage of glazing with Octopus.

If you are interested in how the two variables of form and glazing ratio are interacting with each other, you should optimize for both at the same time. \u00a0I will warn that the glazing based on ratio component uses an \"OffsetCurveOnSurface\" Rhino command that can be buggy at times when the surface curvature becomes too great. \u00a0So you may want to planarize the geometry before this or set some curvature bounds on your design space.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 26, 2015 at 4:00pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you for taking your time to reply(and also thanks for the other clarification \u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/help-no-eio...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/help-no-eio-file-error?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1295920&amp;xg_source=msg_com_gr_forum) couldn't reply there).I really appreciate both yours and Abraham's help.\n\n\n\nI think I should change the workflow than if you say that the component has bugs.First find the form for max solar radiation without openings (to benefit from the passive design, solar gains). next planarize somehow the geometrical outcome, and than run the optimization again this time with \u00a0for max daylighting and min total energy use plus cooling.\n\n\n\nDo you think this \u00a0workflow make sense ?\n\nThanks,\n\nN\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nit\u00eb", "created_at": "June 1, 2015 at 10:12am", "created_by": "Nita", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1287594"}
