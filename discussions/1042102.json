{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI 've been trying the VSC component and have some questions.\n\nI attach my sample file for your reference.\n\nI am testing some sample windows and simple context volume.\n\nMy first question has to do with the maximum values I should get from the VSC. According to the documentation I find online for CIE sky the maximum value should be 39.6% and for a uniform (cloudy) sky it should be 50%.\u00a0\n\nFor each case I get close to those numbers but not those numbers. I get around 38 for the CIE and and 48.something for the uniform sky.\n\nAlso I would expect that for each window, which has the center point above the roof or the context they would all get the maximum value, irrelevant also of their horizontal location,which is not the case (they have very slight deviations).\n\n\n\nAlso I noticed that I have to reconnect the ptsFileAddress input each time I change the testSurface objects, but probably this is an expected behavior.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, just an idea, are you considering of adding a Radiance Folder Output to the runDaylightAnalysis so we don't repeat with text Concatenation the folder location manually? I understand the idea of separating the two parts of the algorithm and reading the results straight from the folder after they are generated, but for light analysis studies it works pretty fast enough to demonstrate in real-time the effect of design changes.\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nDimitris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1042101", "name": "VSC_Test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "April 10, 2014 at 4:13pm", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Vertical Sky Component Results", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Dimitris,\n\n\n\nThank you for explanatory discussion.

Just re-run the analysis couple of times and you will see the numbers will slightly change. You will get 49.something in couple of tries.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zbcSW1D04atJlTquEm74XxrrckwTbo7R28I*3UH0qtIIBSYqxVgBqaeSj5M4-FahUL-QMjazHQj8N-uF8CpqjXlhOvMZHUua/VSC_Perspective.png?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zbcSW1D04atJlTquEm74XxrrckwTbo7R28I*3UH0qtIIBSYqxVgBqaeSj5M4-FahUL-QMjazHQj8N-uF8CpqjXlhOvMZHUua/VSC_Perspective.png)\n\n\n\nAlso I noticed that I have to reconnect the ptsFileAddress input each time I change the testSurface objects, but probably this is an expected behavior.\n\n\n\nIn case you are using searchAnnual component to read the results, connect done output to refresh input so the results will be updated automatically.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zbcSW1D04as-0GNhbc-I0Hzn*mgh3fhHJiNe20ETLgAzT-5ZLR4Hkcqa-APyEsJsQ5gFoy-Nph894zaTUwd0gs4cAaO5vlor/refresh_lookupComponent.png\" width=\"559\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zbcSW1D04as-0GNhbc-I0Hzn*mgh3fhHJiNe20ETLgAzT-5ZLR4Hkcqa-APyEsJsQ5gFoy-Nph894zaTUwd0gs4cAaO5vlor/refresh_lookupComponent.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nare you considering of adding a Radiance Folder Output to the runDaylightAnalysis so we don't repeat with text Concatenation the folder location manually?\n\n\n\nIt is already there. gridBasedResultFiles outputs the file address. Sorry if the example file was confusing. In that example I wanted to make it clear that you can reproduce all the results from the study folder. I intentionally made the result visualization harder than what it can be to make sure users will educate themselves about the outputs but not as hard as what you have been doing. Sorry! :)\n\n\n\nCheck the attached file for a revised version of your file.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zbcSW1D04asxOP6cOuzE2hLfrtvXfmYzxfUlXUCR2gVuzkbH6lPQ8Zh*pwX2G3J*Ex48KhE8J7DpzHbYFCMjhsSOZOnqm7Bj/resultFileAddress.png?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zbcSW1D04asxOP6cOuzE2hLfrtvXfmYzxfUlXUCR2gVuzkbH6lPQ8Zh*pwX2G3J*Ex48KhE8J7DpzHbYFCMjhsSOZOnqm7Bj/resultFileAddress.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1043248", "name": "VSC_Test_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 12, 2014 at 5:07pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nAll looks great!\n\nThanks a million!\n\n\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "April 14, 2014 at 1:49pm", "created_by": "doompop", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1042102"}
