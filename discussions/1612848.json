An hour ago?<br/>Can you try again?\n\n\n\n\n\nOther question, just to be sure, regarding the \"origin_\", is it the central point that you to get out of the output mesh/surface? And does it need to be the point at the actual point elevation or does it need to be the point projected on the ground floor (as I do in my definition)?\n\nYes, you are correct about both things: it's the central point and it will lie on the actual terrain (it will be projected to the terrain).<br/>The latitude and longitude information from the _location input will be taken to find the origin_ point. Elevation will always be ignored, as elevation is calculated from the elevation of the point laying on the terrain at those particular latitude-longitude coordinates.<br/><br/>Please let me know if I did not precisely gave the answer to your questions.
