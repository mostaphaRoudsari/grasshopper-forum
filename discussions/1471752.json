{"body": "\nHello people.\n\nHave a quick question.\n\nWhen you \"prepare geometry\", how do you generate windows?\n\nI started my journey into HB with Chris's tutorials first, where he keep surfaces untouched and just create windows as coplanar surfaces where he needs.\n\nThen I saw Mostapha's \"punching\" method and got a bit confused. Is there any difference or it is just a matter of one's approach?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/tUpf1dE*xKYOX2ZESlcz*RhcI4WPb6Ax1tYj6QQb7-*HgqxN7wdwPsyDLhNTFZ9E0flsIMo*S5Zk28jDFO4ZRtMY3YeRD-AE/Capture.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com/files/tUpf1dE*xKYOX2ZESlcz*RhcI4WPb6Ax1tYj6QQb7-*HgqxN7wdwPsyDLhNTFZ9E0flsIMo*S5Zk28jDFO4ZRtMY3YeRD-AE/Capture.PNG)\n\nBoth ways seem to give same results, can you comment on this? I'd like to go Chris's minimalistic way but want to be sure there are no caveats.\n\nThanks.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "February 25, 2016 at 10:08pm", "created_by": "Timur582", "topic": "Punched-out or Coplanar Windows?", "replies": [{"body": "\nWhile i'm not sure your image is describing both approaches, as far as i remember your description is chronological. Chris's video was first. There you define surface by surface and punch the windows where needed.\n\nAfter that Mostapha implemented a more \"automatic\" method where you can input your surfaces and windows and the method will find which windows belong to which surfaces.\n\nBoth approaches work fine.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 25, 2016 at 11:14pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nYeah, image is a bit unclear, but it is showing Mostpha's method under Geometry Preparation and Chris's way is kinda hanging above.\u00a0\n\nI just like to have least possible stuff around, but without compromising the result.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "February 25, 2016 at 11:22pm", "created_by": "Timur582", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHmmm,\n\nMaybe we are talking about different things now that you said the image is indeed showing both approaches.\n\nThe one above is unclear for me since there you are not differentiating between opaque and glazing surfaces.
