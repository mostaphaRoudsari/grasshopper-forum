The way you have developed your definition I would say that either shade helpfulness (maximize) or shade harmfulness (minimize) can be linked into Galapagos. It will then go through iterations to find out which assembly maximizes or minimizes the fitness.\n\n\n\nI would have to note however, that in single parameter optimization you tend to get expected results. A more useful analysis should include a combination of conflicting criteria, e.g. daylight availability and energy consumption.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "July 4, 2016 at 9:50pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\nThank you for your answer.
