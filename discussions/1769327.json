{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI'm attempting to create HDR and falsecolor images from .tif files and was able to successfully get this working with the base files located on my local hard drive. I tried to process images on a network drive and started having troubles. Is this a known error? Anything that can be done to run images located somewhere other than my desktop?\n\n\n\nSee attached images of the grasshopper file error and the batch file error. The only thing I need to change to get it to work properly is the file location.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nBrett\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1769325", "name": "Tiff2HDR Error.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1769326", "name": "Grasshopper HDR.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Brett Larson", "created_at": "June 14, 2017 at 4:55pm", "created_by": "BrettLarson", "topic": "HDR Falsecolor error", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Brett,\n\n\n\nTry to copy the files locally and use the local path (not the path on the network).
