I believe it is becoming a priority along with cleaning up LB/HB API.\n\n\n\nMe and Chris have also worked for some time in a workflow that links CFD results (coming from OpenFoam) to LB/HB and specifically his micro-climate components. Initial results have been very encouraging and we are just currently looking for a bit of free time to run a few more studies and comparisons in order to assess the accuracy of the method.\n\n\n\nSince Chris is the one developing the code and tools within the work flow I will leave it up to him to decide when he thinks they are stable enough to share. We are also looking forward to that since we understand how important an active community like LB/HB's will be in developing this further.\n\n\n\nAs for learning materials I would recommend you download and install OpenFoam in either platform you prefer, and then going over the amazing User Guide provided. It will work you through a couple of the (many) tutorials that are available within the installation of the software.\n\nAfter that, almost every question that you will have has been asked and answered here:\n\n\n\n[www.cfd-online.com](http://www.cfd-online.com)\n\n\n\nIt is quite a steep curve but after a bit of head smashing on the keyboard it gets much much easier.\n\n\n\nFeel free to ask anything here, either in PM or in this thread maybe and I'll gladly help if I can.\n\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 26, 2016 at 9:08pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you very much, Theodore, for your detailed update!\n\n\n\nI can get OpenFORM installed on Mac OS X and run it correctly.

It seems there is no error with velocity results however pressure values are too low (4 pa max). I have seen that you have added some correction to result values, e.g. for pressure values,its -273,15 pascal(can be seen in the image). But with that correction, you just see negative pressures in all of the domain. Because the values you get at first are too low. So whats the reason that you need to correct the values coming from OF? \u00a0I assumed that the values from OF should be multiplied with 10(power of 5) then atmospheric pressure (101325 for 15 C degree) should be subtracted from these values. I tried that but the latest values were not reasonable.\n\n\n\nSecondly, I couldnt find output files which can be opened in Paraview, did you get the file from butterfly run?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/tELt8V-QL1BOJS5is*qYDPP29g-vF0mGysUmEePWhPRawq6*zQyAxh*zCi7vrJ4hyqzmTkmw971kyPNRjLfymf0yzIv5MrVc/case.JPG?width=561\" width=\"561\"/>](http://api.ning.com/files/tELt8V-QL1BOJS5is*qYDPP29g-vF0mGysUmEePWhPRawq6*zQyAxh*zCi7vrJ4hyqzmTkmw971kyPNRjLfymf0yzIv5MrVc/case.JPG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1659340", "name": "case.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "anarchitect", "created_at": "December 17, 2016 at 9:09am", "created_by": "mimarilker", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThe -273.15 should not be there.
