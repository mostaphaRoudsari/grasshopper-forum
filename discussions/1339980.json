{"body": "\nI want to use a ****brep join**** component to join 2 breps into one closed brep as wall surface for thermal analysis. However, the output of the component is an open brep.\n\n\n\nSo, how to convert **open brep** to **closed brep**?\n\n\n\nThere are two breps in the GH file attached: one is a wall surface with an opening for window, and the other one is the window surface. This is for daylight simulation in which you can't have overlapping wall (without window opening) and window surface.\n\n\n\nBut for thermal analysis, the wall must be a complete surface without opening for window, and the window is a child of this complete wall surface. That's why I want to merge the wall with opening and window into one surface to define a complete wall surface for thermal simulation ...\n\n\n\n... I have the feeling that I talked too much ... anyway, you get what I mean ....\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cxNDsYnHlWRRqtTcs5w9eLaNfUXVTuOkZCg4jArQ0CI9HJA-ZkQ1OHZh78BVb495hEQwkT17TFAj8*viR9c*oiHcu9*0Dlgl/04.PNG\" width=\"376\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cxNDsYnHlWRRqtTcs5w9eLaNfUXVTuOkZCg4jArQ0CI9HJA-ZkQ1OHZh78BVb495hEQwkT17TFAj8*viR9c*oiHcu9*0Dlgl/04.PNG)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cxNDsYnHlWTRqV7AICobMjBp-s1o7YJIRBwJZt2*Vnbsuxw7o3yjrTkdIcoO58uTymRV-n7iH49mGraZQjpu1RN6gPSHdR9v/05.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cxNDsYnHlWTRqV7AICobMjBp-s1o7YJIRBwJZt2*Vnbsuxw7o3yjrTkdIcoO58uTymRV-n7iH49mGraZQjpu1RN6gPSHdR9v/05.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1339979", "name": "open brep.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 8, 2015 at 7:16am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "how to convert an open brep to closed brep", "replies": [{"body": "\nOk, let me answer myself:\n\n\n\nmaybe the approach should be the other way around:\n\n1. create the wall surface without opening and the coplanar window surface that are ready for thermal analysis in the first place\n\n2. use ****region difference**** and ****boundary surfaces**** components to generate the wall surface with opening for window, if this is needed in situation such as daylight simulation in which wall surface and window surface can't overlap.\n\n\n\nAm I correct?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cxNDsYnHlWTcTLEUeK7qrAHlKRy5Ux4cKQvaAlBfpvq1tiws416baAeHUnJmm8rwsl6gSpSZWKZDCutXPoSS1gwDgfqXSXGb/06.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cxNDsYnHlWTcTLEUeK7qrAHlKRy5Ux4cKQvaAlBfpvq1tiws416baAeHUnJmm8rwsl6gSpSZWKZDCutXPoSS1gwDgfqXSXGb/06.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1340216", "name": "open brep _v02.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 8, 2015 at 7:37am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "replies": [{"body": "\nA surface is always an open Brep, or I should say Grasshopper consider surfaces as breps with one face.\n\nI can think of couple of different solutions to have a surface in your energy model and not daylighting model. 1.
