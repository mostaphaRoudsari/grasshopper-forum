{"body": "\nHi! Does anyone have an idea why I get this result when baking with the ReColorMesh component? The meshes look fine when previewing in Grasshopper, but I only get these lines when baking them (using the bakeIt option) \u2013 both the meshes and the legend look like this. It has always worked fine before, so it seems to be something specific to this simulation \u2013 but I cannot find out what...\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pS32jW-GgixdT84HdJvHAB6yCpBuMCMB54xlJ01CB9atGDu7EhxzrCnG6WACwhlyAoMu6REwvxme1sGVqVArb5d22CWvrU4k/Skrmklipp.PNG?width=150\" width=\"150\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pS32jW-GgixdT84HdJvHAB6yCpBuMCMB54xlJ01CB9atGDu7EhxzrCnG6WACwhlyAoMu6REwvxme1sGVqVArb5d22CWvrU4k/Skrmklipp.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Daniel", "created_at": "June 22, 2017 at 9:26am", "created_by": "Daniel568", "topic": "Strange ReColorMesh results when baking", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Daniel,\n\nCan you please share the grasshopper file?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "June 22, 2017 at 10:07am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "\nSure!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1774374", "name": "recolormesh_bake.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel", "created_at": "June 26, 2017 at 1:56am", "created_by": "Daniel568", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Daniel,\n\nChecked baking at my end.
