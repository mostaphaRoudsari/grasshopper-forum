{"body": "\nHi all,\u00a0\n\nI am trying to simulate a Microshade using Honeybee instead of daysim. Below is the link to the document that explains how to run the Microshade simulation in daysim:\u00a0\n\n[http://www.photosolar.dk/userfiles/file/Dokumenter/Guideline%20to%2...](http://www.photosolar.dk/userfiles/file/Dokumenter/Guideline%20to%20daylight%20calculation_2013.pdf)\n\nOn page 6 (picture below) it explains how to define the Radiance material of the Microshade. I am not sure how this could be done using Honeybee. I know that one can insert materials to the Radiance library but how is this done in this case I am not sure.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/poNlDA9JoO1fmDJ71bBBBi0OyHc7n7KPbjb8GpW1z1Yp5*XGPgB9KHgie8WQmsg0f*IA2rhQOEUlc2yVnKFyd8oOUbi0y140/1.PNG\" width=\"318\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/poNlDA9JoO1fmDJ71bBBBi0OyHc7n7KPbjb8GpW1z1Yp5*XGPgB9KHgie8WQmsg0f*IA2rhQOEUlc2yVnKFyd8oOUbi0y140/1.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you guys help me with this?\n\nThanks,\u00a0\n\nAlejandro\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "October 20, 2015 at 3:50am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Simulation of Microshade using Honeybee", "replies": [{"body": "\nI think it should be possible.
