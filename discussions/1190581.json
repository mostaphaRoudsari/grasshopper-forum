I created a simple box and everything works fine. The file is attached! I suggest you to internalize your test geometry and upload it again.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/iJVROLF4NIsnSn3Lb*6kt4xtRgpth6Qu4uUEe811HAGl4R6v0dyc48yCpqcxP7smGa4umEriwxvPzOzI4qEBfJQS02L2*8n*/EnergyAnalysisIstanbul.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/iJVROLF4NIsnSn3Lb*6kt4xtRgpth6Qu4uUEe811HAGl4R6v0dyc48yCpqcxP7smGa4umEriwxvPzOzI4qEBfJQS02L2*8n*/EnergyAnalysisIstanbul.png)\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: Please be patient when you post a discussion.
