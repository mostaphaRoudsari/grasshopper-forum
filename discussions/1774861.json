{"body": "\nHi everyone,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have existing radiance files, radiance material files, and points files and would like to run them using radiance through honeybee. However if I use the following component shown in the image, I need to have honeybee objects. How would I convert my radiance model to being a Honeybee object? OR is this the wrong component to be using?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\u00a0\n\nSandi\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cs*GHo7eRuP-4rm6hy46Cg3nIRxtgSR17RIr9OkvaPGdghu098MQ17fuGGNwvO5NDFOlrvcMqcSqqDusWAL0Y1PjEjs7u7Z7/HB.PNG\" width=\"341\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cs*GHo7eRuP-4rm6hy46Cg3nIRxtgSR17RIr9OkvaPGdghu098MQ17fuGGNwvO5NDFOlrvcMqcSqqDusWAL0Y1PjEjs7u7Z7/HB.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sandi Sirikhanchai", "created_at": "June 26, 2017 at 7:06pm", "created_by": "SandiSirikhanchai", "topic": "Running an existing radiance model with points files", "replies": [{"body": "\nHere is a quick hack. Create a really tiny polygon using Rhino/Grasshopper and specify that in the _HBObjects input. Specify all your remaining files using the additionalRadFiles_ input. Remember that as per the Radiance conventions, your material files should be specified first in the sequence of inputs. You can either specify the points file path directly or just create the points inside grasshopper using the value in the points file.\n\nAnother option, which might or might not work, is to use the import_rad component.\n\n\n\n-Sarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "June 26, 2017 at 8:11pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": [{"body": "\n...you can import the points using \"import Pts File\" component.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 26, 2017 at 8:15pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks for the assist Mr. Honeybee !\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "June 26, 2017 at 8:28pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHey Sarith,\u00a0\n\nYeah I actually did try that (adding a tiny polygon).

Regardless, I did some troubleshooting on your model and have a few suggestions:\n\n1. Radiance does not play well with path-names with spaces in them. So, I'd suggest getting rid of/modifiying all such instances in your materials and geometry files before starting.\n\n2. You need to have a local ground polygon in the scene to get accurate results. As per the model that I previewed, it does not seem to be the case.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8HnsNb3kvGiy9NRO1EYPPpWFOTtFMlvByJTlNPoBJG62thge3jhB-prjhX5SFZhLfZxwvbKrY1-MXH-zoPC0JFf2GTL5ZObk/Capture.PNG\" width=\"591\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/8HnsNb3kvGiy9NRO1EYPPpWFOTtFMlvByJTlNPoBJG62thge3jhB-prjhX5SFZhLfZxwvbKrY1-MXH-zoPC0JFf2GTL5ZObk/Capture.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. As I had mentioned previously, the order in which the materials file and geometry file are linked to the additionalRadFiles_ input is critical. In your case, the geometry file is specified to the materials file first.\n\n\n\nI expect things to work out once you address these issues.\n\n\n\nSarith\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "July 4, 2017 at 5:37pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1774861"}
