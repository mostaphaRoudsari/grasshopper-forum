More specifically, CIE Illuminants like \"A\" or \"D65\" are spectral power distributions that are defined (as per CIE S 014-2/E:2006) for wavelengths ranging from 300nm to 830nm.\u00a0\n\nFor example, CIE Illuminants A,B and C are defined as :\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/CIE_illuminants_A%2CB%2CC.svg/700px-CIE_illuminants_A%2CB%2CC.svg.png?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/CIE_illuminants_A%2CB%2CC.svg/700px-CIE_illuminants_A%2CB%2CC.svg.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd D65 is defined as :\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/SPD_D65.png?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/SPD_D65.png)For illuminance and luminance calculations, the radiation from such illuminants are converted to Lux or Candela/sq.m by weighing them against the Photopic Luminous Efficiency function (also called as V-lambda):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/CIE_1931_Luminosity.png/1280px-CIE_1931_Luminosity.png?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/CIE_1931_Luminosity.png/1280px-CIE_1931_Luminosity.png)The equation (1) used for this purpose is\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/2/9a2784abf032740c36f15f235c79901a.png?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/2/9a2784abf032740c36f15f235c79901a.png)\n\nWhere y corresponds to the V-lambda function and J corresponds to an illuminant like \"D65\" or \"A\".\n\n\n\nSo, why is all this relevant? Honeybee/Radiance also use a similar method for calculation of luminous flux, illuminance and luminance. However, in the case of Honeybee/Radiance the lighting calculations are limited only 3\u00a0 (R,G,B) channels (and not the 300nm to 830nm). So the equation (1) from above becomes something like:\n\n\n\nF = 47.4*R+120*G+11.6*B\n\n\n\nWhere (R,G,B) refers to the spectral power of the radiation and the numbers (47.4,120,11.6) relate to the V-lambda function. <br/> So, the bottom line is that an accurate representation of CIE illuminants is not possible inside Radiance/Honeybee as the spectral information is severely restricted. Some studies have proposed using Radiance with more than 3 channels.<br/> For example: [http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBRM.40.1.304](http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBRM.40.1.304) . However, such attempts have been limited. <br/> <br/> <br/> What is possible with Radiance/Honeybee is to create a fairly accurate representation of brightness of the sky.
