{"body": "\nHi All!\n\n\n\nI'm interrogating a model at the moment because it is providing me rather high heating and cooling loads (9000+ kWh/m2!) for a 42mx43m building and I have two questions:\n\n\n\na) The infiltration schedule that has been created seems to have one day of each week with a very low number (refer to image below). I am confused as to what is happening here, as both sunday and saturday schedules are the same for all other schedules. However, as you can see in the image below, despite having the same schedule (be fully on 24/7), there is one day in every week which is out...\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/iCFrlQwi5qrIyRmNWQZN5QB34ZHC-KpA9E*bUhEPU1b5IiTbfdRa2WNsYVIePnbtx4txcqr3gABft74yopRyse-PDuOvXjtE/InfiltrationScheduleIssue.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/iCFrlQwi5qrIyRmNWQZN5QB34ZHC-KpA9E*bUhEPU1b5IiTbfdRa2WNsYVIePnbtx4txcqr3gABft74yopRyse-PDuOvXjtE/InfiltrationScheduleIssue.PNG)\n\n\n\nb) The ideal loads are not registering the heating and cooling set points I have provided. Refer to the image of the modelling below - it looks like heating and cooling are being provided to the space outside of the scheduled 8-4pm occupancy time. Despite changing the set points to other points, it is not working... is there a component where I can tell the ideal loads heating and cooling to turn on/off? Can you see an obvious issue in my heating/cooling set point schedule (I tried making the set point for when I don't want the heating to turn on to be -10\u00b0C yet it did not seem to work)?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/iCFrlQwi5qoKu8KTm8Zp9XuNf0*pNT57t3zy8jgLQQArGODf*L2vf8v2GTGJnENNnbe37RIU2Lwn1Xbhk6doJdltDAkj7uAc/HeatingSetpointissue.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/iCFrlQwi5qoKu8KTm8Zp9XuNf0*pNT57t3zy8jgLQQArGODf*L2vf8v2GTGJnENNnbe37RIU2Lwn1Xbhk6doJdltDAkj7uAc/HeatingSetpointissue.PNG)\n\n\n\nIs there a bug in this?\n\n\n\nKind Regards,\n\nElzine\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "August 16, 2016 at 7:24pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Infiltration and Ideal Load Scheduling Issue", "replies": [{"body": "\nI decided to try use the HVAC systems and assign the cooling/heating availability that way.
