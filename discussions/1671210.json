{"body": "\nI am currently using the new import gbxml component to import Revit models into GH to analyse.\n\nI want to be able to split the different masses into perimeter and core zones.

Revit has already built-in functionalities to subdivide the zones and then you can bring the zones to honeybee and run the analysis.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 15, 2017 at 3:46pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nI see I see, thank you. So you are meaning the Space Separator tool or the energy model tools which uses conceptual masses?\n\nThe space separator works which is great, thank you, however occasionally the outputs are open breps due to inaccuracies of the drawn lines. Using conceptual masses you can also split the spaces and also export these as gbxml files.
