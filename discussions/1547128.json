{"body": "\nHey Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI'm developing a fairly simple solar fan for a prospective tower. When I change the scale factor for the solar fan component the geometry actually changes (probably a result of the loft?) although that's clearly an error. See the attached images where I change the scale factor and the incidence of the fan on the tower changes significantly.\n\n\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nJeremy Bamberger\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1547125", "name": "gh.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1547126", "name": "rhino_1.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1547127", "name": "rhino_2.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Jeremy Bamberger", "created_at": "June 13, 2016 at 11:16am", "created_by": "JeremyBamberger", "topic": "component problem - solar fan", "replies": []}
