{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and\u00a0Chris,\u00a0\n\nI built curved geometries, just similar as you did in tutorials, and try to run an energy simulation test on it under default \"energySimPar\" settings. Finally it gave me a warning:\u00a0\n\n1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> ** Severe ** Problem in interior solar distribution calculation (CHKBKS)\n\nthe models are quite simple without \"L\" shape zones. so I try to set \"0\" to the \"solarDistribution_\" of\u00a0\u00a0\"energySimPar\" and run it again. this time the \"exportToOpenStudio\" component didn't gave any error or warning, but the\u00a0readEPResult component shows that it didn't work.\n\nI have no idea what could be the reason. Is it an energyplus problem or a openstudio problem or an honeybee problem? how to deal with it?\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\nBest,\n\nGUO\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zuNdr-kLfKVaA8XKrWRUmJ31qo7jlOyQBZGRDI0urHIW20Zf9GPZ2eBwr32uuBHH*5IGh05izlFR37zGVuTW5-dGHsW9dScv/8.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zuNdr-kLfKVaA8XKrWRUmJ31qo7jlOyQBZGRDI0urHIW20Zf9GPZ2eBwr32uuBHH*5IGh05izlFR37zGVuTW5-dGHsW9dScv/8.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zuNdr-kLfKUKaPma7-fUt7Xtw8FN*S73G2YHwxTanLvKv4tosVHSyNmWuyltkJWWAnEi7Hvxp41wWIsZLn4Zy0Vl8dNv0T8c/10.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zuNdr-kLfKUKaPma7-fUt7Xtw8FN*S73G2YHwxTanLvKv4tosVHSyNmWuyltkJWWAnEi7Hvxp41wWIsZLn4Zy0Vl8dNv0T8c/10.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zuNdr-kLfKXY3W8WNO-ZhR5QMCdldET0vg*9i8Z3nUdujDMUKewB2u4R4IagH0*SSUTB-Is5LQOOGd-RY67XZGDloz-C6w23/QQ20170503180232.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zuNdr-kLfKXY3W8WNO-ZhR5QMCdldET0vg*9i8Z3nUdujDMUKewB2u4R4IagH0*SSUTB-Is5LQOOGd-RY67XZGDloz-C6w23/QQ20170503180232.jpg)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zuNdr-kLfKXxDacb9bAJKvV5pPXim4-QksaRpqL0AMvpPiX1T*PiLH7xyTP7l4H3IxXQwSIxujozXDPdkWBdKMPFqRqGS0UQ/QQ20170503180319.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zuNdr-kLfKXxDacb9bAJKvV5pPXim4-QksaRpqL0AMvpPiX1T*PiLH7xyTP7l4H3IxXQwSIxujozXDPdkWBdKMPFqRqGS0UQ/QQ20170503180319.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "GUO.X", "created_at": "May 3, 2017 at 3:59pm", "created_by": "GUOX", "topic": "\"exportToOpenStudio\" component didn't work for curved geometry", "replies": [{"body": "\nGUO.X,\n\nThe CHKBKS warning happens any time you have a concave zone, which includes zone shapes that beyond those that are explicitly L-shaped so you are right to change the solar distribution here.\n\nI don't know why Openstudio is not generating a result file after this change. \u00a0If you upload a GH file with the minimum components needed to recreate the situation, we can check out what is going on.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 6, 2017 at 4:47am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi, Chris,\n\nThank you for your kind reply!
