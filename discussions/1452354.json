{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Co.\n\n\n\nI may be missing discussions, as they are increasing exponentially these days, but I was wondering if there is a quicker more customised way in creating schedules? I notice that in the OpenStudio template master file for Honeybee, all the building programs' schedules are created for daily, interval, etc.\n\n\n\nIs there a way we could include some form of creating a schedule quickly like the way we can create constructions quickly? Currently I have this workflow set up in my tutorials\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cKnzGdTqAJ72*zbhwS3r3WDrXdSQAtmw4YqMjDCAggY03mCOQ0yFv0mrHNAezEvVWn81SjyPYwXn7GHFx9kixod-S9iv5s0c/Schedulecreation.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cKnzGdTqAJ72*zbhwS3r3WDrXdSQAtmw4YqMjDCAggY03mCOQ0yFv0mrHNAezEvVWn81SjyPYwXn7GHFx9kixod-S9iv5s0c/Schedulecreation.JPG)\n\nHowever, it can be confusing for new users to create schedules for certain hours and creating schedules that need to vary for the holidays or certain months of the year can be a frustrating process to manually create within grasshopper.\n\n\n\nOpen to discussion on the topic\n\nCheers\n\nElly\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "February 1, 2016 at 3:10pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "WISH: Schedule Creation", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Elzine\n\n\n\nYou could find something about your wish in this discussion:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/ladybug-sunrise-sunset?gr...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/ladybug-sunrise-sunset?groupUrl=ladybug&amp;xg_source=activity)\n\nPlease, let me know what do you think about.\n\n\n\nBests\n\nAntonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "February 4, 2016 at 12:43pm", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": [{"body": "\nI think Antonello is addressing this issue.
