{"body": "\nHi!\n\nI'm doing an annual daylight simulation on grasshopper using the epw file of Bolzano (Italy). When the analysis starts, it tells that no light source can be found. It happens also if I change the epw file.

The simulation gives out that my daylight autonomy is lower than 0%, which is quite strange, also considering that I've no context around. I'm doing the simulation of a room with two windows, one on the east side and the other one exposed to south. I followed some simulations I've found on Hydra and I don't really understand which could be the error.\n\nI attach the .gh file of the simulation and a screenshot of the result of the room. Can you kindly give a look to it?\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for your help\n\n\n\nMarta\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1572761", "name": "result.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1572762", "name": "occupancy.csv"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1572763", "name": "annual_simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "marta tardiani", "created_at": "July 28, 2016 at 3:57pm", "created_by": "martatardiani", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Marta,\n\nIt\u00b4s working for me (and for you the same way), your problem is the occupancy , try it with normal working hours 8:00 to 17:00 and you will see the difference.\u00a0\n\nI know you have a apartment house so the problem of low DA % is that \u00a0people are never there when the sun is up, so therefore they need to use always artificial light.[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/xe-ETyWEowOPKrDT3WnPbZ9rzDG5dsNcs7vZdYxN*RjxANzDmHX9TiZXzpd2CxO1q5JbosND8QE7UiNVLqkRP6IVb28VYqT8/1_tst.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/xe-ETyWEowOPKrDT3WnPbZ9rzDG5dsNcs7vZdYxN*RjxANzDmHX9TiZXzpd2CxO1q5JbosND8QE7UiNVLqkRP6IVb28VYqT8/1_tst.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Za\u0165ko", "created_at": "July 29, 2016 at 1:05am", "created_by": "PeterZatko", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Peter,\n\nthe simulation runs in the right way using the occupancy file generated by honeybee.
