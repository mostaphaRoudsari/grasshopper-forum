{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI am trying to make a script in grasshopper to calculate the photopic lux for a particular view point in the room. I am considering only artificial lighting for this research.\n\n\n\nPurpose of research- To calculate various photopic lux as I change the distance between the lighting fixtures and the view point.\n\n\n\nI have made the script and connected all grids to the analysis part but I am facing problem of calculating my results.

You should update your HB installation by using the Honeybee_update_honeybee component as the latest release contains some bug-fixes that Chris Mackey and I had made over the past month.\n\n2. You need to specify a sky definition to make the simulation work. In your case it will be dark sky as you are only simulating electric light.\n\n3. I am not sure you can visualize a single point with a mesh. (Maybe you can... Chris , Abraham, Mostapha or Anton can better answer that question).\n\n4. Your simulation will be in meters. So, I think you should either resize your room (if your original dimensions are in feet) or increase the number of fixtures to get a decent illuminance level.\n\n5. Honeybee calculates photopic illuminance by default.\n\n6. I made your simulation work by pasting the contents of your ies file directly into a text panel and linking it to the _iesFilePath. You can also make it work by simply specifying the path directly (ie. something like c:\\light.ies etc..).\n\n\n\nSee the attached file.
