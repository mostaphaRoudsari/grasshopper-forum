{"body": "\nHello everyone, I am new to Grasshopper and Ladybug, so I need your help. I would like to visualize hourly indoor operative temperatures. I want to see the hours above 25 C in red, the hours below 18 C in blue, and the hours of between 18 C and 25 C in yellow for example. And the legend should tell me the % of hours in these ranges.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aylin Ozkan", "created_at": "April 3, 2017 at 9:39pm", "created_by": "AylinOzkan", "topic": "Custom visualization", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Aylin,\n\nThis is possible but not an easy task for a starter. Ladybug currently doesn't support custom legends similar to what you're trying to create. At the same time you can use Ladybug and customize the visualization to get what you want. Attached is an example to get you started.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/MhqovnvrwKqT3gHxSXjoZ*UjGpT9TssFYO9rtRfq5i7U-IFob3jPCdYN*yB50qpaYjPa4t6bAR0jz8AcB*6Qr29lKs8z-3Q9/customized_3d_chart.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/MhqovnvrwKqT3gHxSXjoZ*UjGpT9TssFYO9rtRfq5i7U-IFob3jPCdYN*yB50qpaYjPa4t6bAR0jz8AcB*6Qr29lKs8z-3Q9/customized_3d_chart.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1727940", "name": "customized_3d_chart.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 5, 2017 at 9:16am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Aylin, hi Mostapha,\n\nI've been working on a similar visualization as well.
