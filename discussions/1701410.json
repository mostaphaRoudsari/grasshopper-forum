{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI installed the new version of HB/LB a couple of days ago and I am experiencing the following problem: every time I open Grasshopper the memory use grows progressively (even if I do not open any file) and it ends up blocking my computer after a few minutes. I am not sure this is caused by LB/HB but since I just installed it seems the most likely reason. Has anyone have this problem before? Could I have done something wrong during the installation? The problems persists even after having uninstalled LB/HB.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nAlejandro\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "February 27, 2017 at 2:26am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Possible problem with the new version of LB/HB", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Alejandro,\n\nI never had this issue but since uninstalling them doesn't solve the problem I doubt if it has to do with Ladybug and Honeybee. I think Grasshope once had a similar issue and David helped him to solve the problem. I assume this is something that David should be interested to check and fix.\n\nKeep us posted on the results.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 27, 2017 at 7:17am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}
