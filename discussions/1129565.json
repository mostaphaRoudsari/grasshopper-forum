{"body": "\nHi\u00a0[Mostapha](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/MostaphaSadeghipour),\n\nI did a crossed verification between many solar simulation softwares and saw a shifting in the results produced by Ladybug in the calculation of altitude and Azimuth. The direct results fro Rhino (with the sun tool) are ok, but if I make the same calculation with Ladybug, it gives something incorrect.\n\nIs there a way to understand where does it come from ?\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "laurent lescop", "created_at": "September 11, 2014 at 1:41am", "created_by": "laurentlescop", "topic": "Azimuth/Alttude problem", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 11, 2014 at 6:28am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks a lot.
