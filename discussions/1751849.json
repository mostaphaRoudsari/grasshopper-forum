{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI'm facing some issues with the grizzlybear components.\n\nI'm trying to generate a gbXML file with grasshopper. It functions with a simple box but it doesn't with my custom geometry. I tried both the Honeybee_GrizzlyBear and the OpenStudioToXML without success.\n\n\n\nThis is how the geometry looks like:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/wwSLUdyfawYO*ksq6hKH6VGByzz9Rhqrh5U7A-BI-heKkcEKe6aRmyIw1ocbO4LMPx6B25YfpnbJ*OLhfg6lL-F4kvHyq7xz/Capture.JPG\" width=\"660\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/wwSLUdyfawYO*ksq6hKH6VGByzz9Rhqrh5U7A-BI-heKkcEKe6aRmyIw1ocbO4LMPx6B25YfpnbJ*OLhfg6lL-F4kvHyq7xz/Capture.JPG)\n\n\n\nFor the Honeybee_Grizzlybear, I get this error:\u00a0\n\nnot logging<br/>0 Surface name: dcbc3df6154942f781b0<br/>Surface number: 903329484fec<br/>This surface is a WALL.\n\n[...]<br/>597 Surface name: 9b580fa5fa5b41ec814a_srfP_31<br/>Surface number: 31<br/>This surface is a WALL.<br/>Runtime error (TypeErrorException): 'NoneType' object is not iterable<br/>Traceback:<br/> line 671, in makeSpace, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/> line 1692, in script\n\n\n\nFor the\u00a0OpenStudioToXML,\u00a01. Solution exception:'str' object has no attribute 'getFacility'\u00a0\n\n\n\nMoreover, I have the impression that the OpenStudio Component is complexifying the initial mesh. How could I prevent Honeybee OpenStudio component from adding more faces to initial model?\n\n\n\nYou can find attached the gh definition.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1751848", "name": "Test_GrizzlyExport.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Aymeric", "created_at": "May 15, 2017 at 12:24pm", "created_by": "AymericDELABACHELERIE", "topic": "Grizzly Bear: gbXML creation issue", "replies": []}
