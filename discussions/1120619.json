{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI want to consider the shading effects of sill. It is like adding horizental and vertical shades around the glazing surface. I find the shadingdesigner component in ladybug. But can it be used in daylight and energy simulation? And how to add both\u00a0horizental and vertical shades on a\u00a0glazing surface at the same time?\n\nThank you for help.\n\nDan\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"436\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Kqu4JOS-VwPoBVE8LXt3f*DUw4EF4INRhRJLz3kIy5Sxi9m2NVRrRz2hkz1DqcY0Uu7eCAXeM4KqoURYJAF6oMzmEWhFJHjW/4.PNG\" width=\"351\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Kqu4JOS-VwPoBVE8LXt3f*DUw4EF4INRhRJLz3kIy5Sxi9m2NVRrRz2hkz1DqcY0Uu7eCAXeM4KqoURYJAF6oMzmEWhFJHjW/4.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Hou", "created_at": "August 23, 2014 at 10:06pm", "created_by": "DanHou", "topic": "How to add horizental and vertical shade for a glazing with using honeybee?", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "August 24, 2014 at 2:09am", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "replies": []}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "August 24, 2014 at 2:11am", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Claudio,\n\nThank you for your fast reply. I indeed design the shade geometry by extruding the surface which subtract the glazing area. What you mean is that this geometry is equal to the brep built by that component, is it right? But how can I add this geometry into the simulation (energy and daylight)? If I want to consider the material of shades, is it right to connect it to the HB shades context surfaces component in the figure?\n\nAnd you remind me the parameter settings. I see when the quality should be high, other parameters change.\u00a0\n\nBests,\n\nDan\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"144\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Kqu4JOS-VwNCbMEmOiWUL0yeVBEAXLzngqc8NDpHsoJ8i8oBG9x6HEEHpX3AnKV29m66DGwXQoaqKtcxA7*Z6Ua4RccGmXHM/5.PNG\" width=\"389\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Kqu4JOS-VwNCbMEmOiWUL0yeVBEAXLzngqc8NDpHsoJ8i8oBG9x6HEEHpX3AnKV29m66DGwXQoaqKtcxA7*Z6Ua4RccGmXHM/5.PNG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"148\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Kqu4JOS-VwOOuvimDfsn7plvETEw8pmpquxPl1vsiFJ4D7L2DKyeerQSL1sC59-SKAf8scEak9kWxkJkyzudhDcDMK7bV3ZT/2.PNG?width=721\" width=\"390\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Kqu4JOS-VwOOuvimDfsn7plvETEw8pmpquxPl1vsiFJ4D7L2DKyeerQSL1sC59-SKAf8scEak9kWxkJkyzudhDcDMK7bV3ZT/2.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Hou", "created_at": "August 24, 2014 at 7:14am", "created_by": "DanHou", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi\u00a0Claudio,\n\nI have tried in the condition of high quality, and found it cost far more time to simulate.\n\nDan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Hou", "created_at": "August 24, 2014 at 9:19am", "created_by": "DanHou", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Dan,\n\nClaudio answered your initial question so I just reply to the new ones.\n\n1. Yes. You can use the component but make sure to update your components and use the latest. I mistakenly put EPConstruction input for the component however EnergyPlus doesn't consider the constructions for site shadings. There are alternate methods that you can use if it is critical to have this effect in energy simulation.\n\n\n\n2. If you are still using the same geometry that I have seen before, then set the quality to 1, and add -ab to a higher number. That should save you some time.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 24, 2014 at 11:26am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Dan,\n\nIt looks like you are using everything correctly but Mostapha is right that you have to update with the \"Honeybee_Update Honeybee\" and \"Ladybug_Update Ladybug\"components.\n\nAlso, to clarify, the shading designer component that you initially posted is only meant to produce possible shading geometry off of existing window geometry. \u00a0It is most useful when you want to generate shade geometry for a bunch of windows really fast. \u00a0In order to add properties for daylight and energy simulation to your shade geometry, you use the context component that you posted a picture of.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 24, 2014 at 10:39pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Chris,\n\nThank you for your replies.
