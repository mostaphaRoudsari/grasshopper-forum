Also, if you are comfortable with the E+ objects, you can add additional strings in the Honeybee energy simulation component directly.\n\n\n\nAnother thing you can try is the OpenStudio workflow, within Honeybee, that allows to quickly setup detailed simulations (although it is still in development).\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 18, 2015 at 7:53pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks for reply, Theodoros.\n\n\n\nFor me much more comfort to create idf in idfeditor, and I want just put some parameters inside idf by the means of grasshopper, run energyplus.exe and load outputs from modeling back to grasshopper.
