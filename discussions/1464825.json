{"body": "\nHi all, I am a new user of Ladybug and Honeybee, still watching all the tutorials and I encountered a problem.\u00a0I was trying to get this script with a simple box geometry working based on Mostapha's tutorial on youtube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqbCkjMYxdk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqbCkjMYxdk)).<br/>The example file worked fine after I updated it, but I tried to re-do the script by myself and run the gridbased simulation for illuminance and it gives me a fatal error message\u00a0(as seen on the image, also for DF simulation):\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/w1RO3fq7oDY0k-a3SrSsoxwZXoUM7L-EDKwkn0YaNK2Pb4v5z867lv-Z7kBV2w9R4jssOikr7Vpd9iiKIq0AXhUM30SYLwgp/truncatedoctree.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/w1RO3fq7oDY0k-a3SrSsoxwZXoUM7L-EDKwkn0YaNK2Pb4v5z867lv-Z7kBV2w9R4jssOikr7Vpd9iiKIq0AXhUM30SYLwgp/truncatedoctree.png)\n\nFailed to read the results!<br/>rtrace: fatal - (WWR_.5_TVis_.6_RAD.oct): truncated octree\n\n\n\nRuntime error (PythonException): Failed to read the results!<br/><br/>\n\nTraceback:<br/> line 336, in script\n\n\u00a0\n\nI checked everything again and it still gives me the same error. I uploaded 2 of my script files (one where both illuminance + DF simulation did not work and another one where DF simulation could work).

Do that also for the DFanalysis. Unless you have files with radiance dfinitions that should be embedded in the simulation you don't need to connect here anything.\n\nBTW, why you are not connecting directly the mesh output of the genTestPts to the recipies inputs?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 16, 2016 at 11:10pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you for your help, Abraham, it works well now.
