{"body": "\nI'm struggling with the thermostat setbacks and wondering if there is a bug or if I'm doing something wrong. \u00a0Chris' YouTube tutorial (#22) describes setpoints for an apartment program and he clarifies that setbacks are not possible to input using the thresholds component for that particular example because the OpenStudio apartment schedule doesn't have setbacks. \u00a0I totally get this.\n\n\n\nHowever, I get the same error for the office and classroom programs, and looking at the IDF file it's clear that both of these programs do have setbacks. \u00a0In fact, I discovered this issue because I was trying to model a classroom with heating (&lt;18 dC) but no cooling (&gt;40 dC) and kept getting high cooling energy usage. \u00a0The setback in the IDF file appears to default to 27 dC:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/QxYZWE5p2qsHWvSn4fEmvN85tTsQPuirpmPLMlEMELMGm8RoYikcQzjcXj9mn8VAQ36oRWRRFjfMrE-mUuygDfq3QzNLZqxi/thermostatsetpointfromesofile.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/QxYZWE5p2qsHWvSn4fEmvN85tTsQPuirpmPLMlEMELMGm8RoYikcQzjcXj9mn8VAQ36oRWRRFjfMrE-mUuygDfq3QzNLZqxi/thermostatsetpointfromesofile.PNG)\n\nThis probably explains why even though the max zone temp that is registering is 38 dC and my thermostat is set to 40 dC, I'm seeing a lot of cooling energy use. \u00a0Is there a way of changing the setback through Honeybee?\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1229048", "name": "02_ThermostatSetpt02.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1229049", "name": "02_ThermostatSetpt.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Burin", "created_at": "February 21, 2015 at 8:41pm", "created_by": "Burin", "topic": "Thermostat setbacks", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Burin- I remember we had a discussion about this before the last release.
