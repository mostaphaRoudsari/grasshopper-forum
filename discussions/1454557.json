{"body": "\nHi Honeybee-Experts,\n\nduring validation of a simple one-zone model, I recognized , that there is an unknown airflow in the summer. There should be only constant infiltration of 0.2 1/h and the air flow of a mechanical ventilation with 2.0 1/h during working time. The output \"air flow volume\" of the e+ component shows an additional airflow during the summer months - screenshots.\n\nNatural ventilation is not activated!\u00a0\n\nHas anybody an idea where I can stop this airflow in the model? Is it a bug in the components? You can find the gh-file is in the attachment.\n\n\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nBest\n\nSebastian\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1454554", "name": "air-flow-volume.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1454555", "name": "air-flow-volume-simparams.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1454556", "name": "ventilation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sebastian Sautter", "created_at": "February 4, 2016 at 9:04am", "created_by": "SebastianSautter", "topic": "unknown air flow volume", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Sebastian,\n\nI wonder if something is going on with ideal air loads system. Have you tried to run it unconditioned and see if you see the same pattern? I'll try to take a closer look this weekend.

The default ideal air system template includes an air side economizer, which will mix in more outdoor air to the supply stream when the zone needs to be cooled AND the outdoor air is cooler than the room air temperature. \u00a0I put in this feature because most HVAC systems these days have an airside economizer to save energy. \u00a0You can turn off the airside economizer by setting the airsideEconomizer input on the \"Set Ideal Air Loads Parameters\" to False as I you see below and in the attached GH file.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DMNc-KMuV*nDh0e8FQbgPROOfVmkXTH0KUxAwP06mB79FgJ9rbilgwaBhQZcvKZu1B77J6X0gSDGgeQ*gsDNnuR7p*S151EL/NoEconomizer.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DMNc-KMuV*nDh0e8FQbgPROOfVmkXTH0KUxAwP06mB79FgJ9rbilgwaBhQZcvKZu1B77J6X0gSDGgeQ*gsDNnuR7p*S151EL/NoEconomizer.JPG)\n\nNote that your previously unexplained summertime airflow disappears and your cooling load increases because you are using electricity and your cooling coil to cool your zone instead of the cool outdoor air.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1458455", "name": "ventilation_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 8, 2016 at 9:03pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}]}
