I only want a south oriented window but for some reason I get northen interior windows (perimeter interior zone is set to 0.5m) This analysis is required to illustrate illuminance only . I guess I don't need to provide interior zones in this case\n\nthank you all\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "July 13, 2014 at 12:05pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "glazing based on ration creating unwanted windows In HB v 0.0.53", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 13, 2014 at 12:28pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/dnCWvahr*Cp8GTOUx0MhnAyJNWatFz9OVm*Xf4Pvi638Xy7ncCUI4q-S-KRAWftIG7toBGgP6SpMd*l32k9W9axObwiIPTw5/Canvasat144452.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/dnCWvahr*Cp8GTOUx0MhnAyJNWatFz9OVm*Xf4Pvi638Xy7ncCUI4q-S-KRAWftIG7toBGgP6SpMd*l32k9W9axObwiIPTw5/Canvasat144452.png)thank you Mostapha.
