{"body": "\nHi guys, I\u00b4m trying to use the \"EPConstruction\" component to create some customized constructions by combining materials from the library.

In such a way capital name and low caps are different, even though the \"letters\" are the same.\n\nThis is a bug that i suppose Mostapha/Chris will fix soon (right?).\n\nSee attached. Number 1 is your original case (more or less). Number 2 is a fixed case after changing back the case of the name. Numbers 3 and 4 show what i mean in my response above.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 30, 2014 at 3:17am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nNow with the attached file\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1195902", "name": "20141228EPConstructionquestion_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 30, 2014 at 3:22am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you both.
