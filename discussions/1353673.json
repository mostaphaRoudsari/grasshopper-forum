If you are looking for some specific rays, then you can use Grasshopper's Mesh-Ray intersection component, and count the number of intersections.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 2, 2015 at 10:00am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you Mostapha.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nit\u00eb", "created_at": "September 3, 2015 at 2:48am", "created_by": "Nita", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nNite,\n\nThe Ladybug_View Analysis might also be able to give you what you want and allows you to set the specific points that you are testing the view to. \u00a0It even allows you to set weights to the different points if you are interested in emphasizing a certain part of the outdoors. \u00a0It's very useful for a lot of different applications and I have been using it a lot recently.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 7, 2015 at 12:58pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1353673"}
