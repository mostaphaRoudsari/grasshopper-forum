{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI'm working on a model that change its blinds angle depending on hour. This hourly angle is based on a sun mask study that i have made. The question is: is there a way to run an annual daylight simulation with specific blinds angles for every hour?\n\n\n\nThank you all for your attention!!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Allyson Carvalho Silva Santos", "created_at": "May 12, 2017 at 7:01am", "created_by": "AllysonCarvalhoSilvaSantos", "topic": "[Question] how to create a hourly angle schedule for blinds in annual daylight simulation?", "replies": [{"body": "\nI'm not sure if daysim provides that much of flexibility. You can run the model for each shading angle separately, read the results and merge them together based on the sun-angle.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 13, 2017 at 1:55pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}
