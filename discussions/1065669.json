Just set the right number for _simulationType_ input and the error will go away. I need to set up an internal check for this inside the component.

In this sample file I attached I tried changing the north vector, but it seems to involve no effects.

This is a known bug ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/20](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/20)). It hasn't been really implemented. Sorry! :)\n\nFor now you need to rotate the geometry itself. I will fix this soon. I'm thinking to remove the north input from runDaylight and add it to sky components. I'm not sure yet.\n\n-Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 8, 2014 at 9:31am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nAh, ok. That one could be a solution even if the option would be excluded from the annual analysis that doesn't need the sky components but just the weather file.
