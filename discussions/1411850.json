Illuminance values above 20,000 lux are very common in the outdoors or when you are in direct sun. \u00a0If you check the \"Global Horizontal Illuminance\" of an EPW file, you will see that the outside light levels can get as high as 100,000 lux in the summer at noon in most climates.\n\nI hope this explanation helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 7, 2015 at 10:09pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1411850"}
