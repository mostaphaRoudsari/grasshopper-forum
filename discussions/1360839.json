In other words, daylight saving is an agreement to change the clocks for an hour. The sun will show up in the exact same positions as it is supposed to. If you like to get a more accurate result then you can set-up the timestep to a high number.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 22, 2015 at 5:06pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nPyrit\u00a0\n\n\n\nCould you please attach your Grasshopper file and I will have a look for you\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n\nAnton\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "September 13, 2015 at 1:29pm", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "replies": []}]}
