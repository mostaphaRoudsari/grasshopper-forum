{"body": "\nI'm working to advise my colleagues on when it's appropriate to use a full year analysis period and when one might want to use a particular subset of a year, both for more accurate results and to reduce computational burden.\n\n\n\nThe generic goal is to analyze radiation to inform a shading solution to provide thermal comfort for the building's inhabitants.\n\n\n\nIn the past I've charted dry bulb temperature and isolated those hours throughout the year where the temperature is above approx. 70-75deg F / 21-23deg C.\n\n\n\nI get the same exact result (mid-March through mid-October for NYC) if I use the Ladybug Psychometric chart used with only basic inputs (dry bulb, humidity, pressure) and isolate the HOY which fall into the comfort/passive polygon. I think this is due to the consistently high humidity and pressure in the NYC area, meaning their effect on the analysis period is negligible.\n\n\n\nAt any rate I just wanted to make sure that my thinking is correct on this and that I'm isolating this period in the most efficient manner possible, as I would like to present this workflow to my colleagues.

I remember that, in NYC, this is from March to October.\n\nIf you want to be hard core about your shading study for comfort, I can recommend a workflow with the \"comfort shade benefit evaluator\" component that I have not gotten the chance to make a tutorial video for yet. \u00a0The attached file outlines how to do it in your case. \u00a0You have to run an energy simulation of unconditioned zones (free-running) for that analysis period that you just selected and you can use the resulting indoor temperature from the simulation to do a comfort shade benefit run. \u00a0This will ensure that you are blocking the sun that makes the inside of the building too hot but still letting in the sun when you want it in this period. \u00a0Of course, if you want to look at the effect of direct sun falling on occupants inside the building, that is a different ball game and one where you should use the \"Solar Adjusted Temperature\" component.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions of if this is helpful.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1160909", "name": "011_Comfort Shade Benefit Evaluation for Bldg.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 3, 2014 at 8:45pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHa yes I do want to be hard core.
