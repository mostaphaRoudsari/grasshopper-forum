{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI have noticed that as I use HB and LB they gradually eat my RAM and never free the memory even after an operation is completed.

The problem mainly happens while it tries to solve adjacency for many zones. I haven't been able to sort out the adjacency so I am not sure if this would also be carried over to later operations. I think I have been pushing the limit of HB a bit by having 200+ thermal zones across 7 floors but anyway, I still think HB has got great potential especially because Rhino is the primary mean of 3D communication between Architects and sustainability consultants here in Japan.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nDaniel\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Daniel Mak", "created_at": "April 4, 2015 at 7:23pm", "created_by": "DanielMak", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nDaniel,\n\n200 zones definitely sounds like you are pushing the limits of HB (as well as E+ if you were to get to the stage of running the model). \u00a0My recommendation to you if you don't want to go the route of a more powerful computer (it sounds like you've already got a good one) is to break up the building into a few separate energy models (maybe break it into 3) and put adiabatic walls in between them. \u00a0\n\nBeing strategic about where you choose to break up the model (across boundaries of similar microclimates) will help ensure that your results are still accurate while you narrow down the system boundary of the building. \u00a0Also, if there are any cases where you expect two or more zones to have similar thermal behavior, joining them into one zone will also help cut down the solve adjacencies and model run time.\n\nIt's always difficult to hit the right balance between highly-resolved zoning that ensures an accurate result and the grouping of microclimates to ensure a fast/manageable run of the model. \u00a0Zoning is an art.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 6, 2015 at 11:07am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1253949"}
