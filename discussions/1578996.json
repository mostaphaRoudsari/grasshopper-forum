{"body": "\nRhino version: 5\n\nGrasshopper Version: 0.9.0076\n\nLadybug/Honeybee version: 0.0.61/0.0.58\n\nQuestion: Is there a way to get results from Ladybug/Honeybee into 3D PDF. I can get the model in through SimLab/Tetra 4D, but the results mesh (or vector \u2013 I have tried both) do not show up. I\u2019m assuming this is because they don\u2019t have a material associated with them?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Samantha Peart", "created_at": "August 9, 2016 at 10:10am", "created_by": "SamanthaPeart", "topic": "3DPDFs of Ladybug/Honeybee results", "replies": [{"body": "\nSamantha,\n\nIt sounds like you need to have the mesh colors formatted as an image texture map.\u00a0 I had plans for building this option automatically into Ladybug but have not gotten around to it yet.\u00a0 There are ways to do it now that are a bit hacky but should work for you.\u00a0 See this conversation:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/bake-it-wit...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/bake-it-with-colors-to-3dsmax)\n\nAnd this discussion has the script that will get you there:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/how-to-render-mesh-colors](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/how-to-render-mesh-colors)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 9, 2016 at 3:55pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Chris!
