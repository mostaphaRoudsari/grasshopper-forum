{"body": "\nHello All,\n\n\n\nI am in the process of learning Honeybee and \u00a0am trying to generate an EUI for a simple geometry and am looking for a tutorial or some guidance on how I should go about doing that.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Idea is that I can do a series of iterations using Grasshopper and quickly have ladybug/honeybee estimate the EUI of the geometry. (the geometry would take the climate information from ladybug into consideration.)\n\n\n\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated! I tried looking through the forum but didn't find something that fit the above description.\n\n\n\nThank you in Advance!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "November 16, 2016 at 12:49pm", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "topic": "Calculating EUI", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Melissa,\n\n\n\nI am assuming you already have found resources to learn Honeybee.\n\n\n\nIn honeybee, after you have successfully finished a simulation and you have results coming out of your Honeybee_Read EP Results component. You can use \u00a0Hoenybee_Normalize Data by Floor Area component to find EUI for cooling, heating, etc. The component can be found under 10 | Energy | Energy\n\n\n\nDevang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "November 16, 2016 at 1:11pm", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\n\n\nYes, I am using the tutorial on youtube to learn Honeybee.\n\n\n\nI will try what you indicated above and see what results it gives me.\n\n\n\nThank you!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "November 16, 2016 at 2:09pm", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "replies": []}]}]}
