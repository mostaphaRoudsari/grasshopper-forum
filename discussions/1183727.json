{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nTesting some illuminance results for NY, in a typical office module, I get some results that look weird. Trying June 21st, Dec 21st and look ok. March 21, 23, 24 and so on looks like there is very sharp change which looks wrong, as March 20 looks smoother transition and correct.\n\n\n\nCould you pleas advice if there is something wrong with the results?\n\n\n\nI attach the relevant files.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183724", "name": "Illuminance_Results_Comparison.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183725", "name": "Illuminance_March_21_NY.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183726", "name": "Grid_Based_Day_Analysis_HB_01.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "December 8, 2014 at 10:09am", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Illuminance Results check", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Dimitrios,\n\nIn general I don't suggest to use coloredSkyVisualizer for cases like this, since it is not climate based and may give you a wrong understanding. You can use Honeybee_watchTheSky component or Ladybug_skyDome.\n\nNevertheless, the results are correct and as expected since you have a very different radiation values for that two hours which will generate different skies.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-*rcMYSmUcWFY53zvJNmaDTq7KPTt7ts3JmBOz19S-TSHI2DbZHsvZ04s8YYga4wL*L6*q6AmHfxM6u2eYoFns03usECbXeN/skyRadiationValues.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-*rcMYSmUcWFY53zvJNmaDTq7KPTt7ts3JmBOz19S-TSHI2DbZHsvZ04s8YYga4wL*L6*q6AmHfxM6u2eYoFns03usECbXeN/skyRadiationValues.png)\n\nThat's exactly the reason that there is an averagedClimateBasedSky component. It has no inputs for the day and averages the value for the whole month, so get a representation of that hour during the month.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 9, 2014 at 7:58pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nJust wanted to get a quick idea of the sun location without using the Ladybug Sunpath.\n\n\n\nHoneybee_watchTheSky produces three HDR images in the folder of climateBasedSkies, but is there a way to display those in Rhino or Grasshopper?
