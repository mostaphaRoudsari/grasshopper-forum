{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI would like to know if it is possible to add absolute (bulk) values for People occupancy and Light and Equipment loads in the setEPZoneLoads box (or another tool), regardless the floor area. I am modelling buildings divided in up to 3 zones, without the internal floors and, for now, I have to do it manually on Energy Plus, but it would save me time if I could find the right tool on GH.\n\n\n\nIf there is any ideas on how I can address this, or simply a confirmation that doing it on Energy Plus is the best approach, I would appreciate.
