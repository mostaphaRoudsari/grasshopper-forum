I am also able to replicate the problem. It seems to crash in the following case:\n\n1) Open the tutorial file that has the EmbryoViz graph already placed. The graph component should not be connected to anything.\n\n2) Connect some null data to the graph. The component crashes as shown.\n\n2b) Alternatively, connect a list of numbers to the graph. The component does not crash, but remains grey and fails to generate the graph.\n\nInterestingly, the component doesn't crash if you start a new canvas, add the graph component, save, reload the canvas and repeat the steps above.\u00a0\n\nAlso, the component doesn't crash if you add your own copy of the graph component to GH and then feed data into it. See my attached file - the component on the right I added myself.\n\nSo I'm not exactly sure what the problem is - it isn't exclusively a problem with EmbryoViz, but likely some kind of clash between HoneyBee and EmbryoViz. May be worth contacting John Harding (creator of EmbryoViz).\n\nIn the meantime, when you load the tutorial file, just delete and re-add the graph component from the canvas.\n\nJames\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1077992", "name": "20140526 embryoviz crash.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1077993", "name": "20140526 embryoviz crash 2.png"}], "created_by_name": "James Ramsden", "created_at": "May 25, 2014 at 7:48pm", "created_by": "JamesRamsden", "replies": [{"body": "\nFirstly thank you for your timely answer,\n\nI've made some attempts about points 1),2),2b).

See the yellow frames in the file to see what i changed/added. The first one didn't affect the result but as a question of \"good behaviour\" define the type of camera and the type of render. The second one worked for your case, though right now i'm not sure why it worked well. It\u00a0 only re-render the picture adjusting the exposure. I didn't think it is supposed to affect that much. The only thing is maybe that you are using a previous \"old\" version (the release version). You can see that the second yellow have more updated dates in the components. I added another group where you can update automatically the file to the last repository in the github both the file and the library of components. Just be careful with this one since there are some components that change the names of the inputs/outputs or the numbers of inputs and outputs. Those are not updated properly in the document, so you need to insert the updated component from the menu and reconnect the whole thing.\n\nProbably Mostapha can explain much better than i did, but in the meantime you can run (or walk).\n\n-A.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1079094", "name": "000_GettingStarted_With_Honeybee_A.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1079095", "name": "JackTest_RAD_Perspective@exp_0500.GIF"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 27, 2014 at 4:00pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nUpdated the file to the last version and it works fine.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1079413", "name": "000_GettingStarted_With_Honeybee_A1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 27, 2014 at 10:43pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}]}]}
