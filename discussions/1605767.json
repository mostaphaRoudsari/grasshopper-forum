{"body": "\nHello!\n\n\n\nIm having trouble understanding how to manage the resolution of a imagebased rendering in ladybug. I have tried to change the width and height in the imagebased component but\u00a0I seem to get the same resolution with a larger viewport (it is not changing the image quality, only the image size) The same happens when i try to change the viewport in rhino and set the imagebased resolution to 0.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions on how to increase the quality of an rendering (imagebased simulation)\u00a0in ladybug?\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1605765", "name": "Imagebasedrendering.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1605766", "name": "Imagebasedrendering.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Afshin Ghafoori", "created_at": "September 26, 2016 at 4:25am", "created_by": "AfshinGhafoori", "topic": "Changing the resolution (Image quality) of imagebased simulation - Ladybug", "replies": [{"body": "\nIs this what you are trying to do?\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1606359", "name": "Capture.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "September 27, 2016 at 5:09am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nOr, in the HB_RADParameters component, improve the quality of the image.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "September 28, 2016 at 9:46pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHello Abraham!\n\n\n\nSorry for the late response.

If you are interested in conducting validation studies of some sort, a more accurate resource will be using real-time data collected by a weather station close to you(direct-normal radiation and diffuse-horizontal radiation for daylighting).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "November 14, 2016 at 10:39am", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you Sarith, I will dig in to this part of the architecture!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Afshin Ghafoori", "created_at": "November 20, 2016 at 4:48am", "created_by": "AfshinGhafoori", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1605767"}
