{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\n\nI am having a error when using the component \"csvSchedule\" to generate an occupancy schedule for the \"readAnnualResultsI\" component when doing an annual simulation.\n\nIf I use the \"Daysim\u00a0occupancyGenerator\", it shows good results: every test point has its color. But when I feed the csv path of the file generated with the \"csv schedule\" it shows only a blue color, without difference between test points and no legend.\n\n\n\nI also tried with files generated with this component for other projects, but the results are the same.\n\n\n\nMaybe because these files are for E+ and not for Daysim?\n\n\n\nThanks for the help!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Federico", "created_at": "June 4, 2017 at 11:02pm", "created_by": "Federico587", "topic": "Occupancy Schedule Incompatibility?", "replies": [{"body": "\nIt might be because of the difference between the schedules but if I remember right they should both look very similar.\n\n\n\nAre you using float numbers?
