{"body": "\nI'm currently doing a lot of daylight and radiation simulations with Honeybee and Ladybug, but I keep running in to the same problem multiple times:\n\n\n\nHow can I implement/define loose elements in a zone to get a realistic daylight simulation?\n\n\n\nFor example: What if a room has a small wall or element in the middle that does not cut it into two zones but does take away light in the space behind? How does Honeybee allow this element to be taken into account for daylight simulation?\n\nOther example: What if you have a 6 storey Atrium, with one walkbridge in the middle that decreases the amount of Lux underneath but does not cut the atrium into separate zones?\n\nWhere should I add such a surface in my GH-HB definition?\n\n\n\nHope someone can help\n\n\n\nGreetz!!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dwayne van Halewijn", "created_at": "December 8, 2015 at 3:39am", "created_by": "DwaynevanHalewijn", "topic": "Shading Elements within Honeybee Zones", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Dwayne,<br/><br/>I'm not really an expert since I started using these tools just few weeks ago, but I think that if you run just daylighting analysis using Radiance as a software engine you have no problems in adding this \"isolated\" objects. You just have to assign them a radiance material using a\u00a0'Honeybee_createHBSrfs' panel and then plugging them into the \"_HBObjects\" input of the\u00a0\"Honeybee_Run Daylight Simulation\" panel.\n\nRadiance should not care about zones, if they're opened or closed etc..\n\nRegards,<br/>Claudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Marini", "created_at": "December 8, 2015 at 5:35am", "created_by": "ClaudioMarini", "replies": [{"body": "\n[Here](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Surface_by_surface_geometry_preparation_for_daylight_simulation_II)\u00a0is an example that follows the workflow that Claudio mentioned.
