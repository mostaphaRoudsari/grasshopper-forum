{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI have a stp or a Brep from a CAD software that I want to create EP simulations for.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Import the attached file onto Rhino (either stp or stl) both are same\n\n2. Run Grasshopper command in Rhino\n\n3. Drop LadyBug_LadyBug and HoneyBee_HoneyBee onto GH canvas\n\nNow, hit F4 on grasshopper and create Brep Object\n\n\n\nI don't see my 2 volumes, I see these messages on the Brep:\n\n\n\nEmpty Brep parameter\n\n1. Floating parameter Brep failed to collect data\n\n\n\nI'm sure these is something simple missing in my workflow. Please guide.
