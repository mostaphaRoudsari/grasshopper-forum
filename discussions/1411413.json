{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI'm trying to model a Light Shelf in HoneyBee, but when i apply the preset material (Honeybee Radiance Mirror Material) it has no effect on the scene: essentially it doesn't reflect the light that is supposed to bounce off of the shelf.\n\nCan anybody help me?\n\nAttached there's the script and a picture showing what I'm trying to model.\n\nThank you all!\n\n\n\nAlessandro\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1411411", "name": "Shelf.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1411412", "name": "unnamed.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alessandro Corso", "created_at": "November 28, 2015 at 9:51am", "created_by": "AlessandroCorso", "topic": "Mirror Material", "replies": [{"body": "\nhi Alessandro, did you check the normal direction for the shelf? mirror materials should face the light.\n\n-masoumeh\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "masoumehta", "created_at": "November 28, 2015 at 1:39pm", "created_by": "masoumehta", "replies": [{"body": "\nYes, I checked the normal of the surface.\n\nIf I flip it, the Ladybug component Bounce from surface will stop working with a \"No reflection\" error.
