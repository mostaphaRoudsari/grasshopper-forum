For Radiance the type will be assigned using the integer value of the type (Wall has the same material as undergroundwall).\n\n\n\nYou can change the default material by using \"set radiance material\" component.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/l0-9MwVwNFFOAUXPFhrExK9QWIXqZmGeHqAS2j-bUOGHohyGYD11wuNk6EgclgEakTLRuuQNHatc4O6ucyG0-Uafk32AvWb5/radianceMaterials.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/l0-9MwVwNFFOAUXPFhrExK9QWIXqZmGeHqAS2j-bUOGHohyGYD11wuNk6EgclgEakTLRuuQNHatc4O6ucyG0-Uafk32AvWb5/radianceMaterials.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 16, 2016 at 8:43am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nthank you for the reply. Well of course I know about the possibility to read the characteristic of the Radiance material but I mean in the case we don't apply any Radiance material. So the question is what is the reflectance of the default materials. I say this also because I get an error when I use the \u00a0component Get from radiance library. So I thought I get this error because the default materials are not Radiance materials properly defined.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/RBh5pTSdbmuSxPvK3tL4tima6QrbmkQHU6bM1Rd-vqPJly0UTYh2-RWsy6Yc4HMB9zgdLz4kFrQfXX2k6ikmNJv0WJUTj6zp/Untitled1.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/RBh5pTSdbmuSxPvK3tL4tima6QrbmkQHU6bM1Rd-vqPJly0UTYh2-RWsy6Yc4HMB9zgdLz4kFrQfXX2k6ikmNJv0WJUTj6zp/Untitled1.jpg)\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "September 18, 2016 at 11:46pm", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHello again Mostapha,\n\nok now something magic happened and the component \"Call from Radiance Library\" works so I can read the material used by Radiance and then ask for the properties with the component \"Radiance material info\".
