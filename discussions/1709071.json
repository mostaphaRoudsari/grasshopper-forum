{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to estimate the glare potential using the file on hydra.\n\nWhen I run your geometry, everything works well. Just I change the geometry of the room, I don't have any results.\n\nHow is it possible? Any ideas to solve the problem?\n\n\n\nAttached is the grasshopper file with the new geometry.\n\nThank you so much.\n\n\n\nAndrea\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1709070", "name": "Estimate_Glare_Potential_Over_a_Year.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Andrea Zani", "created_at": "March 9, 2017 at 6:41pm", "created_by": "AndreaZani905", "topic": "No results Sunlight analysis hour_change GEOMETRY", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Andrea,\n\nCheck Surface Normal, and Flip your surface Geometry by Flip component.\n\nbest,\n\nOmid.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Omid Rashidi", "created_at": "March 9, 2017 at 7:36pm", "created_by": "OmidmRashidi", "replies": []}], "id": "1709071"}
