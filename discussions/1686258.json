Instead, I recommend that you model this with Honeybee, which is a safer and more fool-proof way of accounting for radiation that has to pass through several surfaces with the same transmittance.\n\nThanks for bringing the type hint issue to our attention.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 9, 2017 at 7:15pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI did notice the input was missing in the updated versions, I ended up using the one you had for us before the alteration purely so I could get some indicative images to use in a memo to demonstrate only on a visual basis the differences.\n\nI moved to using Honeybee's Radiance analysis, but was stumped when I was faced with the issue of getting hourly results from it =/ (I needed to provide our CFD modeller the radiation values for the measurement points so they could do an outdoor thermal comfort study) I couldn't find any components which would allow me to grab hourly radiation outputs, so instead, I set up a parametric model to simulate a grid analysis (whereby the hours in the skyfile were parametrically changes) and put the simulation type to Radiation, set it to record the results into an excel sheet, and then produced a macro to combine all the data 500 simulated results into one spread sheet..\n\nIt was a bit of a loop, but we got there in the end!!\n\nCould I perhaps request a means to grab hourly radiation data from the Radiance simulation? It is very simple to grab illuminance, but for the life of me I couldn't find the radiation files =(\n\n\n\n- Elly\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "February 9, 2017 at 7:53pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThis is quite straight forward to do with Honeybee[+] if you're willing to give it a try.
