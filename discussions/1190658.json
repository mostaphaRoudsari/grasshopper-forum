{"body": "\nHi,\n\nFollowing this item in this [discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/insulated-night-shutters?groupUrl=ladybug&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987&amp;id=2985220%3ATopic%3A1184446&amp;page=2#comments) i've found that also the LB_ComfortShadeBenefit is failing.\n\nAttached an example of this failure.\n\nIt complains about\n\n1. Data in the _temperatures input does not possess a valid Ladybug header.\u00a0 Data must have a header to use this component.\n\nEven though i connected the selHourlyData output from theLB_sunpath to the Temperatures input of the ShadeBenefit.\n\nBut in the attached you can see other 3 examples where one input is missing to connect in order to make the component work. Once you connect this the component fails. Of course there are different inputs, while the temperature is connected. The common thing among all cases is that it complains about the same thing.\n\n\n\nI'll appreciate your help.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1190657", "name": "ComfortShadeBenefit.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 17, 2014 at 12:56pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "LB_ComfortShadeBenefit bug", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI see that the output of the LB_Sunpath:selHourlyData is missing header and contains only the data for \"light\" hours.\n\nOn the other side the LB_ComfortShadeBenefit:_temperatures hint asks for connecting this data while in the example\u00a0OutdoorShadeBenefitEvaluation this input is connected with the LB_OutdoorComfortCalculator:UTCI which has aheader and the whole range of hours.\n\nSo it will be correct to assume that the first case is not valid anymore (closing this discussion, and the hint should be updated)?
