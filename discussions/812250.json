{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha,<br/><br/>Looks like I'll be doing some environmental solar analysis on a project, so I thought that I would give your tools a try. I just checked out the videos and they look very impressive! Really cool of you to provide the whole thing as open sourced Python components.\u00a0Congrats on a great job :)<br/><br/>I just have a few questions about preparing the input geometry for analysis. In my\u00a0case study\u00a0I think I shall mainly be using the**\u00a0\"Ladybug_Sunlight Hours Analysis\"** and\u00a0**\"Ladybug_Radiation Analysis\"** components to drive the\u00a0geometry\u00a0of a shading system. I apologize if these questions are obvious or have already been answered (I did check out the previous posts beforehand):<br/><br/>\n\n1) Units, which would be the best modelling unit to work with (I assume Meter, but you never know)?<br/><br/>2) Model, I can use either Brep or Mesh as input. But if I want explicit control over the grid size/analysis faces I guess I should use a mesh right?<br/><br/>3) Mesh, if one only wants to analyse a specific part of the building envelope, would it make sense to have the rest of the envelope be \"context\"?<br/><br/>4) Mesh, is the analysis only performed on the front mesh faces (the side where the normals are pointing)?<br/><br/>5) Mesh, would it make sense to have each glass pane be a quad face (I assume the test points correspond to either mesh vertices or face centers)?<br/><br/>Hope this makes any sense, I'm a bit new to the whole \"environmental analysis\" world. Be gentle :)<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Anders\n\n\n\n<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<br/><br/>\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anders Holden Deleuran", "created_at": "March 19, 2013 at 4:31am", "created_by": "AndersHoldenDeleuran", "topic": "Best Practices for Input Model Geometry.", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Anders,\n\n\n\nThe best answer would be given by Mostapha, but until he comes, maybe I could answer some of the questions:\n\n\n\n1) Yes you need to use the Meters, as the solar radiation results are in kWh/m2 or kWh.\n\n4) I think you are right - the vectors of the mesh faces need to be directed towards the radiation source.\n\n5) Not sure I understood you about the quad, but the center of each face represents the radiation point.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "March 19, 2013 at 4:53am", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Djordje,\n\nJust trying out the the various components and getting the hang of things now.

I'm waiting for your awesome comments on Python scripts \u00a0optimization. Here are the answers:</font>\n\n\n\n<font size=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 13px;\">1. In theory, you should be able to use any units for input and the result will be always in SI! There is an internal conversion from Model Units to Meters. [Warning: I developed and tested the 'bug only in meters and I haven't tested it [</font>intensively<font size=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 13px;\">] for other units. I recommend you to use meters for now.]</font>\n\n\n\n<font size=\"2\">2. Correct! If you input a mesh the component will use the initial mesh as the test grid else it will be meshed based on the gridSize which you won't have full control...</font>\n\n\n\n<font size=\"2\">3. Correct! That's how you can minimize the time of the study to zero not calculating what you don't need to know! :)</font>\n\n\n\n<font size=\"2\">4. Correct! [and that's why the direction of the normal of the surfaces does matter. It should face outward.]</font>\n\n\n\n<font size=\"2\">5. You can do that but then the accuracy of the result could be\u00a0questionable\u00a0in some cases. As djordje said center points are the test points and probably you don't want all the glazing to be evaluated based on one single point in case the glass is partially shaded. I\u00a0understand why are you doing that though and\u00a0I will add the option to\u00a0[average the result for each test surface](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/25)\u00a0similar to what I show in this video 22:27 ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoMy4O3vN6g](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoMy4O3vN6g)), so you can\u00a0subdivide\u00a0the test surface and then get the average results for the surface.</font>\n\n\n\n<font size=\"2\">Best,</font>\n\n<font size=\"2\">Mostapha the gentle! ;)</font>\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 19, 2013 at 9:47am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThat is indeed very gentle, much\u00a0appreciated\u00a0Mostapha :)<br/><br/>I spent most day yesterday getting\u00a0acquainted\u00a0with the plugin and its various components (and environmental solar analysis in general). Absolutely loving it so far. For some reason I always had the idea that performing this type of work would be highly involved, time consuming and, well, rather boring. Guess I was wrong. Also having it all right in GH really adds a whole other dimension to it. Again, great work!<br/><br/>After having kicked around a couple of simple test studies I see what you guys are saying regarding point number 5). Think I shall just stick to using Breps and the built in meshing routines for now.

I'm so happy that you liked Ladybug. :)\n\nI should write a discussion or capture a video to discuss \"sunlight hours\" versus \"radiation\". I'll be traveling for the next 10 days and probably I won't be able to do that before I come back! The quick reply is not to use sunlight hours for shading design. Sunlight hours is mainly a city planning measure.\n\nLadybug [as it is right now] doesn't consider indirect bounce and reflections [so material doesn't matter]. As far as you are using Ladybug for radiation analysis for outdoor analysis/massing studies it is fine but if you have surfaces with high reflectivity then you should use a more advanced tool like Honeybee/RADIANCE where you can assign the right material to the surface!\n\nThank you for keeping an eye for bugs inside the 'bug!\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 20, 2013 at 8:53am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Anders,\n\nBehind the \"innocent\" question there is much more depth than you can imagine.\n\nMostapha is completely right in his warning about the use of radiation vs shading hours. Their intent are different though they are related at the end.\n\nThe big question that you should ask before using any of them (and others) is what do you want to see/get from the analysis. And this is pretty much related to the design. Take for instance the design of a window in building. Probably you'll be more interested in the radiation you can get (or avoid) to perform better, energy wise. But take the case you want to design a playground (or a coffee shop terrace, or any other use you want) for winter time or summer time. Then the sunlight hours analysis is much more important and relevant than the radiation. I can extend in the explanation if you want, but i suppose the issues are clearer now, right?\n\n\n\nI find significant the adjective Anders used to refer to such kind of analysis: He was expecting them to be boring. But now he find the interesting and triggering. This is, in this case, to Mostapha's recognition/right for providing a (simple) tool that designers can use as a part of their workflow: Thumbs up for that Mostapha.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 20, 2013 at 9:28am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThis is great advice, thanks guys!
