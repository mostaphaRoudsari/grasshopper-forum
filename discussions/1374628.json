{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Chris,\n\n\n\nThe new energy balance component is great for understanding the various sources of heat gains and losses!\n\n\n\nI wonder if we can add an additional output \"total building energy consumption\" for this component because it took me a while and several components to make this happen (see part of the workflow in the GH file attached.)\n\n\n\nSo, I made a copy of your energy balance code and added a few new lines using your original code as a template. Now we can output and plot this variable using bar chart.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPls see if this is useful and necessary.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/nkLEPVQ6s9cvH6mG55JomCGjRS3X3J4haNeBDfDo*jXHHfYre94PRQg9hygxIW1jFvLZpKz-5u-Mb2nQ3q1D3qvtNjwUF*Ns/01.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nkLEPVQ6s9cvH6mG55JomCGjRS3X3J4haNeBDfDo*jXHHfYre94PRQg9hygxIW1jFvLZpKz-5u-Mb2nQ3q1D3qvtNjwUF*Ns/01.PNG)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/nkLEPVQ6s9esl10S7i4ZMru6aRxo6wj8ynSj5BKWxp1FovWzjnp8CBTnrBCEHujH4H02Ueg7EDHQEwyAquxGAFPzNp3ZqkOT/02.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nkLEPVQ6s9esl10S7i4ZMru6aRxo6wj8ynSj5BKWxp1FovWzjnp8CBTnrBCEHujH4H02Ueg7EDHQEwyAquxGAFPzNp3ZqkOT/02.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1374627", "name": "energy_breakdown_v002.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "October 7, 2015 at 2:39am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "add a \"total building energy consumption\" output for the \"energy balance\" component?", "replies": [{"body": "\nThis looks amazing!
