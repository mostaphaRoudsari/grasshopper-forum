The first solution is to use an IES file to create the electrical light in your scene. Honeybee has an IES&gt;HB component for that. You can check\u00a0[this discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/simulating-ies-lamps-file-through-rad-materials?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1170056&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987) for more information.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/DNRCvs-5-8H0e8m7nFjkW8XAxphfe1om5geGwx3CBN16XPUQdryMIW6HixPq3Tf2AkNeRxHE7pG105x7KnJvPiepGac0V0Gr/importSphereIES2.png\"/>](http://api.ning.com/files/DNRCvs-5-8H0e8m7nFjkW8XAxphfe1om5geGwx3CBN16XPUQdryMIW6HixPq3Tf2AkNeRxHE7pG105x7KnJvPiepGac0V0Gr/importSphereIES2.png)\n\n\n\nMoreover Honeybee is able to parse standard radiance materials as far as they don't have modifier so you can just type the material string and connect it to a surface and it should just work fine. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/W-BK82a1GssTRBKpkFDwr78BNyWK1ERUtKxWupvcenQ-ssOgn*Lso0byt6vLm59nd7TeoFdtvgVzcJNtMv4QsJ5ck3vK1Vyj/lightMaterial.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/W-BK82a1GssTRBKpkFDwr78BNyWK1ERUtKxWupvcenQ-ssOgn*Lso0byt6vLm59nd7TeoFdtvgVzcJNtMv4QsJ5ck3vK1Vyj/lightMaterial.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1324154", "name": "lightMaterialInRadiance.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 11, 2015 at 3:35pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you for your answer Mostapha!
