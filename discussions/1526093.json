Ladybug components are userobjects and are created from a single Python component. Currently when you press CTRL+ALT + LMB\u00a0Grasshopper identifies them as GHPython components but it can potentially check for Component.SubCategory.\n\n\n\nThe best solution for now is to open the editor and check ghenv.Component.SubCategory\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/jACL*2XH9YkxzD9Fg*xqOLdarPeSnhnMXOZ3n02l299OclojGCmke1pEYZ*OO1oZQkA5ke1abD2uckypiFV4mpCzNkTiu-ps/Subcategory.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/jACL*2XH9YkxzD9Fg*xqOLdarPeSnhnMXOZ3n02l299OclojGCmke1pEYZ*OO1oZQkA5ke1abD2uckypiFV4mpCzNkTiu-ps/Subcategory.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 9, 2016 at 7:25am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\n:)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mohamed Naeim", "created_at": "May 11, 2016 at 11:49am", "created_by": "MohamedNaeimAbdelgalilIbrahim", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1526093"}
