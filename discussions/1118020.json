{"body": "\nWorking from example file 06, from honeybee, the annual daylight analysis....\n\n<br/>Everything works fine when i reference masses that are relatively simple extrusions of a boundary curve, such as the attached. And i get realistic annual results.\n\n\n\nStrangely, when i insert a void in the center, making a courtyard, the simulation still runs, but the results are very low, and not realistic. My theory here is that 1) i am doing something wrong, or that 2) the \"MassesToZones\" component was not intended to parse \"donut\" shapes, and is having trouble.\n\n\n\nWhat is troubling, is that the windows preview correctly, so the geometry looks right,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI was able to model \"donut\" shapes by modeling the space without using the MassesToZones component, but in this case it appears that i cannot take advantage of the glazing-by-ratio components features, which appear very useful.\n\n\n\nSuggestions appreciated!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1118017", "name": "void model.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1118018", "name": "void.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1118019", "name": "no void.png"}], "created_by_name": "Octagon26", "created_at": "August 18, 2014 at 10:50am", "created_by": "Octagon26", "topic": "Annual Daylight Simulation (MassesToZones component) struggles with \"donut\" shaped BREPS", "replies": [{"body": "\nI have uploaded the rhino and gh files here\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Octagon26", "created_at": "August 18, 2014 at 10:53am", "created_by": "Octagon26", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nfile too large, uploading individually...\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Octagon26", "created_at": "August 18, 2014 at 4:27pm", "created_by": "Octagon26", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nI guess you are using old version of Honeybee.
