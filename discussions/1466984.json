{"body": "\nHello Everyone!\u00a0\n\n\n\nFirst-- thank you for all the hard work. The fact that Ladybug exists is amazing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSecond-- my problem. I am trying to break up psychrometric analysis by season and by day/night, so 8 graphs total (4 seasons, 2 conditions). I am just going to do this with four separate psychrometric chart components. I can use the analysis period to block out the 4 seasons, no problem. I can also write a conditional statement using c&lt;=0 for direct radiation to get whether it is nighttime or daytime (or something in between if I use a value other than zero). However, when I try to connect both, I receive an error:\u00a0\n\n\"1. Solution exception:global name 'getHOYsBasedOnPeriod' is not defined\"\n\n\n\nI've updated my ladybug, and replaced all the components involved. I attach the file that I'm working on, and the Vienna weather data that I'm using as a test.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThoughts or help would be much appreciated! (Under a bit of a deadline here, actually)\n\nAlexander\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1466982", "name": "Psychrometrics_day_night_problem.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1466983", "name": "AUT_Vienna.Schwechat.110360_IWEC.epw"}], "created_by_name": "AMJaco", "created_at": "February 19, 2016 at 2:18pm", "created_by": "AMJaco", "topic": "Psychrometric Chart Problem", "replies": [{"body": "\nAMJaco,\n\nThere was a bug that only affected cases where you have both an analysisPeriod and a conditional statement connected. \u00a0I have fixed it in the version on the github and in the attached GH file.\n\nAlso, the operation you describe can be done with just one psychrometric chart component like so:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Arj-j*1Gcz0ZRG3L32lCfM*Tlo16JKOHkxkzr-tOB5udJRAnR9zh10NX-nO67a2XKzWIXM9185Si6zQYTInDxSIxnwMsRYmj/OnePsychChart.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Arj-j*1Gcz0ZRG3L32lCfM*Tlo16JKOHkxkzr-tOB5udJRAnR9zh10NX-nO67a2XKzWIXM9185Si6zQYTInDxSIxnwMsRYmj/OnePsychChart.JPG)\n\n(see attached GH file for how it works).\n\nCheers,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1467091", "name": "OnePsychChart.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 19, 2016 at 8:41pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}
