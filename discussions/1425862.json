(Sorry, probably I'm just lacking the basic understanding on how to merge the THERM model results with EP construction)\n\nFor what I understand, in the example file we start from the THERM materials and THERM model in order to simulate the thermal bridge. The WALL-NOTHERMALBRIDGE EP construction element is a \"standard\" EP abstraction of the real wall (with the CELLULOSE EP Material created from THERM CELLULOSE Material) that doesn't take into account the steel material in it, the resulting EP Construction has five material layers against the six materials of the real wall.\n\nIn the WALL-THERMALBRIDGE EP construction instead we substitute the \"CELLULOSE...\" insulation material layer (layer 4) with a \"special\" material capable to transfer the thermal bridge phenomenon inside the EP construction.\n\nIn THERM we simulate the whole 2D model with fixed boundary condition (only needed to calculate R and U value, so I guess we can leave the example values in every country) and we obtain an R-value of the overall lenght of the simulated wall. After importing the THERM result we subtract from it the R values of the other four layers of the WALL-NOTHERMALBRIDGE EP (so that we don't calculate them twice), and then we create a specific new EP Material (ThermalBridgeMat) in which the conductivity comes from this operation and then we rebuild another EP construction material in which the layer 4 is the new ThermalBridgeMat. Is it ok?\n\nNow the question is, are there any guidelines on hints to understand how to break up for example a \"linear\" thermal bridge problem to better evaluate it? I Post an image with a basic example:\n\nLet's say I have a two-storey house (ground floor and first floor) and the floor of the first floor creates a thermal bridge in the wall (red line). Probably in Energy+ I\u2019ll go for a two zones modelling. Now in order to take into account the thermal bridge how am I supposed create the THERM file? I could (First hypothesis) leave the ground floor wall as it is, and simulate the slab and the first floor wall together (cyan box), and then \u201cspread\u201d the new value all over the first floor wall, or I could simulate the ground floor wall, the first floor and the slab and use an unique value for the two walls, which is better? Is there any documentation to understand if there is a basic workflow in order to tackle the issue?\n\n\n\nThank you very much and sorry for the long post!!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1736765", "name": "Therm_Energyplus_question.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Filippo", "created_at": "April 21, 2017 at 2:08am", "created_by": "Filippo", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nFilippo,\n\nYour interpretation of the Hydra example file is correct. \u00a0I admittedly over-complicated the hydra example file a bit by trying to change only one material in a 5-layer construction. \u00a0I did this so that I could preserve the effects of thermal mass in the construction by keeping the other 4 layers. \u00a0However, you can probably just substitute the whole wall construction with a single NoMass Material construction that has an R-Value that matches that of the THERM model U-Value (minus air films). \u00a0This should be good enough if you just want to understand the impact of the thermal bridge on energy use.\n\nFor your case, I would use two separate HBSrfs to model the above-grade wall in E+: one that has a thermally-bridged construction derived from THERM and another that has the typical construction (without the effect of the floor slab). \u00a0The height above the ground that you make the thermally bridged HBSrf should match the height of the above-grade portion in your THERM model. \u00a0I wouldn't worry too much about accounting for thermal bridges in your below-grade zone as E+ models ground zones without much envelope heat loss by default (it assumes a constant ground temperature of 18C).\n\nSo I would say your first hypothesis is sufficient but breaking the above-grade wall surface into two surfaces will give you the most accurate model.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 22, 2017 at 4:35pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you very much Chris for your quick answer!\n\nI absolutely agree with the idea to change only one layer in order to better take into account all physical parameters of the other layers.\n\nAs for my case, I could even run a first THERM simulation of the whole first floor wall with the thermal bridge in order to understand (by looking for examples at temperatures) at what height I should \"break\" the first floor wall\u00a0into two different surfaces.
