{"body": "\nHi Ladybug+Honeybee team\n\nFirstly I would like to express my gratitude for providing such amazing climatic design tools to the community. Keep up the great work!\n\nIn the last days I have been experimenting with the shade benefit evaluator tool, trying to determine the general shape of horizontal outdoor shades in various places of a waterfront.\n\nI have noticed that although the tool seems to suggest correct shading forms, the numerical results (degree-days per sq.m.) are not easily comparable between different cases and this may cause misinterpretations. I did a few experiments using the Hydra example and examined only the shade helpfulness to make things less complicated.\n\nWhile keeping all grasshopper parameters the same (including grid size = 1m) I changed the geometry of the potential shade and the area to be shaded. It can be observed that as the examined area becomes larger, the relative contribution of each shading patch becomes less significant. This is expected since the method calculates the percentage of the sun blocked as the component description states. Yet, the comparison of the calculated metric (degree-days/sq m) can easily lead to the assumption that the larger shade is less efficient than the smaller in terms of thermal comfort (1 degree-day/sq m vs 12 degree days/sq m), which is not true.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/F0w1ASrn6MreWPVQq388i-cn1HOxdtXJjQbA2ynu539Vx27Oc5YloPegyeSOQfSNrhXLUBh1n41nhcuN1A0*BTCc4ZXS7AQc/shade1.JPG?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/F0w1ASrn6Mpl36LEe75lrfIjlZho2xIQucEJtArpICFJtkFT70nCdN4Sh*zwJlB-Ib1KOF-Ixl*cgNo799Er4Y4yfbza8QtU/shade3.JPG)[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/F0w1ASrn6Mp2CUx7b9mMGOvSBWTDAgUTBrY6hJxUCauITfEiNtQSk*FmjeOXLtUxskhjUfW6ZI5wqdLPOFUPqAurbYDFFIq7/shade3.JPG?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/F0w1ASrn6Mp2CUx7b9mMGOvSBWTDAgUTBrY6hJxUCauITfEiNtQSk*FmjeOXLtUxskhjUfW6ZI5wqdLPOFUPqAurbYDFFIq7/shade3.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same problem can also be observed when changing the resolution of the analysis to finer levels (e.g. 0.5m or 0.25m) while keeping geometry the same, although according to the component description, normalisation should take care of that (see fig. below).\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/F0w1ASrn6MqPqy3Qj9sa1lU1vsuaGD0f1B8PaV-JmtpWRyxThXv8suUdu4QJINmvZ-UFAzlil*5vI5ylr52S203W-*D3FjnE/shade2.JPG?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/F0w1ASrn6MqPqy3Qj9sa1lU1vsuaGD0f1B8PaV-JmtpWRyxThXv8suUdu4QJINmvZ-UFAzlil*5vI5ylr52S203W-*D3FjnE/shade2.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this normal?

Multiplying the shadeneteffect values by the testregion area, as you have suggested, seems to yield more comparable results. I have attached the relevant gh definition to this post. You can see the result below:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hAXKVxAmtpLZabVLGmPgcEvhRW4b21cZTYnnpcjEPE0VFOsKqkDeIufBEtQeloyfeuc0R0-Ahh0NPNxKo0ocpnCVelCV9XX3/comparison.jpg?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hAXKVxAmtpLZabVLGmPgcEvhRW4b21cZTYnnpcjEPE0VFOsKqkDeIufBEtQeloyfeuc0R0-Ahh0NPNxKo0ocpnCVelCV9XX3/comparison.jpg)\n\nAssuming that each person occupies a fixed amount of space, a multiplication by the number of people should generate similar results. However, the metric would get even more complex (DegreeDays*no. of people/m2 of shade). On the contrary, the multiplication by the test region area creates an even simpler metric (DegreeDays) which might be used to compare \u201clevels of shading service (or disservice)\u201d between different shaded areas.\n\nAs you already mention, the existing metric is not \u201cwrong\u201d and has its own uses, so you could either clarify this in the component description or add the new metric as an output.\n\nBelow you can see a comparison of two cases from the study site I am currently investigating. The site is a waterfront located in Crete with mostly northern, western and northwestern orientations, so the yearly shade harm is insignificant. The multiplication of shadebenefit by site area seems to provide a better interpretation of the shadow effect.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hAXKVxAmtpLWB7VBANUN*n5VG7vFK0eWp4z3Y-ExV3syEkXa1k8gg4jPmSf5iq2i-DUOE95K1mxPHzvrmglAe5KJfyHyWzDe/existing_metric.JPG?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hAXKVxAmtpLWB7VBANUN*n5VG7vFK0eWp4z3Y-ExV3syEkXa1k8gg4jPmSf5iq2i-DUOE95K1mxPHzvrmglAe5KJfyHyWzDe/existing_metric.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hAXKVxAmtpLn8sD00rzC1p8ANM158BsJPnzBnbSflmYBIEyznV57M9TmrGeIoUIsW-NMKKoLpeUUKhxjeyUUQDAH8Y317NeE/mulitpliedbytestregion.JPG?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hAXKVxAmtpLn8sD00rzC1p8ANM158BsJPnzBnbSflmYBIEyznV57M9TmrGeIoUIsW-NMKKoLpeUUKhxjeyUUQDAH8Y317NeE/mulitpliedbytestregion.JPG)You can also observe that in the case of a west-facing site (case on the right) a horizontal shade has a smaller impact on thermal comfort (slightly lighter blue color) than southern/northern cases.\n\n\n\nBest Regards\n\nAris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1605671", "name": "Outdoor_Comfort_Shade_Benefit_2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Aris V", "created_at": "September 26, 2016 at 3:53am", "created_by": "ArisVartholomaios", "replies": []}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 26, 2016 at 9:58am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1603846"}
