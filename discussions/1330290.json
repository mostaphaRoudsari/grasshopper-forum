{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nto evaluate the difference between an annual analysis in E+ with and without thermal history (warmup+sim) we tried to develop a way to overcome the LB-limits of the analysis period component (switching from h24 to h1).

Warmup period is different from the analysis period and is critical for the accuracy of the results. Are you trying to set the warming up period to 0 days to see the effect on the results?
