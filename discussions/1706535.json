Additionally, try increasing mesh quality as that Z structure can get ugly really fast on rough meshes (try smth like 0.1-0.2m).\n\n\n\nFinally, make sure your probes are inside your mesh, there have been a few instances of values like these when the points were at the border or outside the mesh. To do that scale your input surface on the probe component by 0.9 or smth to make sure the edge of the pressure points are inside the mesh.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 26, 2017 at 9:56pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}]}
