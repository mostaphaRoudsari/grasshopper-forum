{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI was running a model with HB and E+ and everything was fine. I decided to move the Rhino model into a new file, rebuild and refine my GH on it and add some additional details of material and programs. Now I try to run the E+ calculation and is not runnign giving me different geometry problems every time. I open my previous GH definition with the sam RHino file and runs just fine! I am really puzzled (and sleepless) since I want to run the newer version.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn the mean time the construction EP material components seem to have some issues. I can create and save a new material but the latest version of E+ simulation doesn't seem able to find them and turn orange. After I change to existing EP material the problems with the new simulation begin!\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny ideas?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 20, 2015 at 2:45am", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "topic": "WIERD ENERGY+ SIMULATION PROBLEM!", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Tasos,\n\n\n\nIt might be easier to examine the problem if you upload both file, and screenshot your error message in your system..\n\nHave you make sure that you are running with the same unit?

Eventually there were two problems:\n\n\n\n1. Whenever I re-open my gh files GH asks me to let ladybug and honeybee fly since all the used components are red. Recomputing or disabling/enabling the two components works but not always, as such I had to use new ones. At one of these times though I had one Honeybee_Honeybee component forgotten on the canvas that did probably overwrite my data. I erased it and send the one in use back as Chris suggested and the simulation ran with my new material!\n\n\n\n2. I am using parallels on a mac where the directory on files that are saved in shared folders between the two systems are quite long and complicated. I was saving my EP calculations to one of them and this seemed to cause badly written .idf files. I moved the target directory to a local (C:\\) file and the EP can now normally read them and re-edit them!\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am using the latest updates from GitHub, the only paradox in the problem mentioned above is that the readme output of the EP simulation component was giving everytime a different set of severe errors that (in my understanding) reads back from the generated EP file (is that correct?) which is weird since the files were not written properly!\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo far so good!
