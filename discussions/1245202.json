Based on the image that I have attached, can anyone tell me what might be the problem. Mostapha, I copied this component from the file you sent us (I couldn't even find the component myself). If I click it, it seems to run multiple runs and\u00a0saves multiple\u00a0folders, but I cannot get them to read.\n\nAppreciate it!\n\nSaurabh\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1245201", "name": "runitall.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Saurabh Shrestha", "created_at": "March 18, 2015 at 8:43pm", "created_by": "SaurabhShrestha", "topic": "Run It All", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Saurabh,\n\nMaybe attach your file too, and somebody acan help you with that, but till then I think just use BRUTE FORCE component from the TT Toolbox , it makes the same\u00a0\n\n\n\nregards\n\nPeter\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Za\u0165ko", "created_at": "March 19, 2015 at 3:31am", "created_by": "PeterZatko", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Peter for letting me know about the BRUTE FORCE component.\n\nI have attached my files here too if anyone knows what the problem is.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nSaurabh\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1245987", "name": "Parametric Shading.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1245988", "name": "Parametric Shading.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Saurabh Shrestha", "created_at": "March 19, 2015 at 12:42pm", "created_by": "SaurabhShrestha", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Saurabh,\n\nThe warnings are fine. What do you mean by you \"cannot get them to read\"? You mean you can't find the folders? All this component does is animating the sliders, and as Peter suggested BruteForce component does the same.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 19, 2015 at 5:45pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nI was having problems reading the folders\u00a0I thought it might have been the RunItAll component in the first place.
