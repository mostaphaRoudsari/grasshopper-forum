{"body": "\nHi everyone!<br/><br/>Thank you again for the fantastic tool you developed! It's really giving me a considerable help in developing my thesis work.<br/>Last time I wrote here asking help about the evaluation of UTCI and PET through the\u00a0\"Outdoor comfort calculator\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Thermal comfort indices\"\u00a0components and the analysis worked pretty well.\n\n<br/>Now, since Chris (thank you!) added the\u00a0\"PET analysis Recipe\"\u00a0component to Honeybee, I wanted to define an outdoor\u00a0microclimate\u00a0map in order to compare the UTCI and PET and PMV (even though this one can be evaluated only for indoor conditions) indices and to evaluate more accurate results. I will then do the same simulation using an urban weather generator tool (Dragonfly maybe) in order to show the effect of urban heat islands on the outdoor comfort.\n\n<br/>So, I wrote the definition for the above-mentioned analysis, trying to obtain something similar to what you can do with the software\u00a0Envi-met, considering the buildings like uniform blocks with two generic materials (one for the walls and one for the roofs) and giving the ground zone a material with the proprieties of the basalt stone (since it is the main material in my analysis area). I also accounted the trees and the transparency of their canopies (using the definition that is on Hydra).<br/>At last, I simplified the better I could the geometries of the buildings in my area, so that there are no problems with the exportation of the geometries to OpenStudio.\n\n<br/>Unfortunately I have a problem with the Honeybee ComfortRecipe components and Grasshopper shows this message:\u00a0\"If you have connected a\u00a0viewfactorMesh\u00a0that includes regions on the indoor, you must connect up energy simulation data for\u00a0zoneAirTemp,\u00a0srfIndoorTemp,\u00a0zoneAirFlowVol,\u00a0zoneAirheatGain\u00a0and\u00a0zoneRelHumid\"\u00a0although I think I didn't set any indoor zones. Furthermore, when I connect these inputs to the Recipe component, the results seem to be weird and inexact.<br/><br/>Anyone knows what could be the problem? I think it is something about the geometries of my model, but I don't know exactly how I could fix it.<br/><br/>I hope I explained clear my issue.<br/>I\u00a0know that maybe the problem is more simple as I expect, but I'm quite new to these tools and I hope I can learn more asking for advice.<br/><br/>Attached you can find my definition with the internalized geometries.<br/><br/>I hope someone can help me and still thank for all your work.<br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>Francesco\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1535085", "name": "Microclimate map UTCI vsPETvsPMV Internalised.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Francesco Scarpati", "created_at": "May 22, 2016 at 10:14am", "created_by": "FrancescoScarpati", "topic": "Outdoor Microclimate Map issue", "replies": [{"body": "\nFrancesco,\n\nYour comfort evaluation surface definitely had some points that were inside the zone geometry. \u00a0When the surface is right at the ground level, Rhino may think that the surface is actually inside the zone. \u00a0I would move your comfort evaluation surface to be 1 meter off the ground in order to be representative of typical human height. \u00a0\n\nAlso, you did not intersect the ground with the rest of the zone geometry, resulting in an incorrect energy simulation. \u00a0After intersection, you also get one surface of the ground zone that is not inside any buildings. \u00a0I fixed these two things in the attached file ad it works:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"undefined\"/>](http://undefined)\n\nI would also recommend breaking the top surface of the ground up into sub-surfaces so that you can capture the variation in ground surface temperature that happens across the outdoors. \u00a0Second, I would recommend putting some windows on your buildings as the exterior surface temperature of windows can be very different than that of opaque surfaces. \u00a0Finally, you should keep in mind that the outdoor maps are assuming a very basic outdoor wind profile by default and, to accurately understand outdoor comfort, you really should be incorporating wind patterns after running a CFD. \u00a0This discussion has some information about importing CFD from other programs to GH:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/import-cfd-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/import-cfd-result-to-honeybee)\n\n<br/>-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 23, 2016 at 4:30pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris!<br/><br/>Thank you very much for your immediate answer and sorry if I could reply just today.<br/>Unfortunately I couldn't see the picture you attached but I did anyway what you said and the definition is now working perfectly!<br/>As regards the glazing surfaces, I wanted to try to define something similar to the\u00a0Envi-met\u00a0simulations, as I already mentioned, that's why I didn't put any glazing component in my definition. Moreover, I'm working in a XIX century urban context, so I assumed that accounting the glazing surface (that are just a little portion of the facades) wouldn't have changed too much the results of the simulation.<br/>Regarding the CFD simulation, I didn't know that there was a way to evaluate it in Grasshopper (and this is one of the reasons why I'm using\u00a0Envi-met\u00a0to have results to compare with the ones of Ladybug and Honeybee).

Experimentation so far has been quite successful and we are just waiting on a few example studies to release initial results.\n\n\n\nI think it might be interesting to compare this method with a tool like Envi-met, which from what I understand is quite popular in urban micro-climate studies. If you want, I could assist you with setting up and running CFD simulations of your model. We could then pass the wind velocities into Chris's micro-climate analysis tools and compare the final results with what you have through Envi-met.\n\n\n\nI believe this experiment could be valuable for all of us.
