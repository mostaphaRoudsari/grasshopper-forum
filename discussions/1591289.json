{"body": "\nHi everybody ,\u00a0\n\nhope you are well , I updated LB &amp; HB \u00a0but unfortunately, Hb can't recognize Openstudio\u00a0, it's asking to install the latest version . the latest version of openstudio\u00a01.12 is compatible with energyplus 8.5 but for HB we need energyplus\u00a08.4 , so I installed openstudio\u00a01.10 which is compatible with energy plus 8.4 \u00a0but I have the same problem. Also I checked the openstudio\u00a0files on LB folder (on my system) and unblocked it .[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5rCHVdQFf2mUjdDypuYlxVTyhweVz5cIwMlLJ7N5DE5sOb3yDHLTWJYMM57ToiXlXBgcMxkoCrXAK267zcrJAYoFFYaC25b8/011.jpg\" width=\"639\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5rCHVdQFf2mUjdDypuYlxVTyhweVz5cIwMlLJ7N5DE5sOb3yDHLTWJYMM57ToiXlXBgcMxkoCrXAK267zcrJAYoFFYaC25b8/011.jpg)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5rCHVdQFf2moMbX8ZgQsUw37GL2wCL*2YDJlIOjgbTlLw5CaZtoy9sQrkH2qFqxWibzvmjkj71Y4ONrDzekGFJqkdD-HMTgn/0111.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5rCHVdQFf2moMbX8ZgQsUw37GL2wCL*2YDJlIOjgbTlLw5CaZtoy9sQrkH2qFqxWibzvmjkj71Y4ONrDzekGFJqkdD-HMTgn/0111.jpg)\n\nI hope you can help me solving this issue ,\n\nThank you ,\u00a0\n\nMona\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "August 31, 2016 at 8:07am", "created_by": "monarezk", "topic": "openstudio error", "replies": [{"body": "\nMona,\n\n\n\nYou don't need to worry about installing E+ for Honeybee if you install OpenStudio correctly. \u00a0OpenStudio includes a compatible version of E+ and Honeybee knows to use that one if it finds OpenStudio. \u00a0So you are better off installing the latest OpenStudio.\n\n\n\nIn any case, check to see if you have this folder:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\OpenStudio 1.12.0\n\n...or, in your case, this folder:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\OpenStudio 1.10.0\n\n\n\nIf you don't have at least one folder of this variety, then you do not have OpenStudio installed in the correct location on your system. \u00a0Try installing again taking the default install location.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 3, 2016 at 1:35pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi ,\u00a0\n\nI installed energyplus 8.5 with openstudio 1.12 \u00a0\" the latest versions \" but still have the same problem , what should I do to solve this problem?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "September 3, 2016 at 1:37pm", "created_by": "monarezk", "replies": [{"body": "\nIs that folder in the location that I suggested you check?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 3, 2016 at 2:21pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris ,\u00a0\n\nThank you so much , I reinstalled openstudio\u00a0in the right location .
