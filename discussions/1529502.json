{"body": "\nDear everybody,\n\n\n\nI am a rookie to HB. I`m trying to use srfs to build a zone by defining types of srfs.\n\nBut when it came to decompose by types, the output WINDOW always run null. I don`t know wheather i use create HB srf correctly. And everytime I use AddGlazing component to create window, the output of it always be 'open brep' instead of closed brep.\n\n\n\nthe final goal is to run energy simulation.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThere are 2 attched image to show the 2 problems.\n\nAnd the gh file with internalized data.\n\n\n\nThank you so much!\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1529499", "name": "question 01.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1529500", "name": "question 02.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1529501", "name": "question.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Lei  Yang", "created_at": "May 13, 2016 at 4:06am", "created_by": "LeiYang", "topic": "HB_Add glazing component", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Lei, If you check the warning it tells you what's wrong with your model.
