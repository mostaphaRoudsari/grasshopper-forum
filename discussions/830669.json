It doesn't show anything special. I found the default value based on annual runs and that's why it doesn't give you a good graphic for a single day. I should fix it for the next release to work for both cases.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile you can manipulate the number in\u00a0genRadRoseArrows function in Ladybug_ladybug component and find the right relationship for your study.\n\n\n\nThere is a line as:\u00a0ptMoveDis = 20 * internalSc\n\nChange it to:\u00a0ptMoveDis = .20 * internalSc\n\n\n\nlet the modified version of Ladybug fly and re-run the radiation-rose. It should give you an acceptable graphic.\n\n\n\nThanks for reporting this and let me know if it didn't work so I can send you the modified version.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 17, 2013 at 8:32pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha,\n\nIt did work for that specific situation (one day).
