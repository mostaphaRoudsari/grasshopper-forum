I assume that it is only happening for image-based analysis?\n\n\n\nMy best guess is I messed up something when I applied parallel run for image-based analysis. I wonder if one of the pieces of the image is problematic and makes the whole process fail. Here is another case that Alexander reported recently ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/photo/shadow-study-with-radiance](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/photo/shadow-study-with-radiance)).\n\n\n\nCan you send me .hdr file which fails in the process of generating falsecolor image? I can look into it then. Should be an easy fix.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 25, 2014 at 2:11am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nOne more question.

Even in \"Top\" view, depending on how I've zoomed in the scene, it makes a difference.\n\nThe falsecolor HDR seems to consistently work. The normal render HDR doesn't always. Converting HDR to GIF is also inconsistent, and I'm not sure why since the code doesn't change...\n\n\n\nHere are some screenshots of a case that was successful and another that failed. I've also included the files. Notice the slight change in viewing angle.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1137423", "name": "testing.zip"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1137424", "name": "Failed.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1137425", "name": "Successful.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Vasken Merovingian", "created_at": "September 25, 2014 at 7:12am", "created_by": "VaskenMerovingian", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThe rest of the screenshots:\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1137166", "name": "Failed_to_convert_but_HDR_OK.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1137167", "name": "Conversion_bat.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Vasken Merovingian", "created_at": "September 25, 2014 at 7:13am", "created_by": "VaskenMerovingian", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks.
