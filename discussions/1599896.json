{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nIn order to take in account daylight saving time while analysing comfort during working hours in a building, I am doing the simulations in two steps- one for the winter time and the other for the summer time. This is not very efficient because in this way data and charts need post-processing.\n\n\n\nI wonder if it would be possible to add to the Ladybug Analysis Period component the nice options that OpenStudio has on its Site tab (in the attached picture).\n\n\n\nIn case there is already a way of doing it or a workaround to this issue, please tell me.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\nJorge\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1599895", "name": "OS_DaylightSavingTime.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Jorge Conejo", "created_at": "September 15, 2016 at 10:40am", "created_by": "JorgeConejo", "topic": "Daylight Saving Time.

You can already do it for the annual daylight calculation.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 16, 2016 at 8:48am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nMeanwhile, you can use additionalStrings input to define daylight saving time.
