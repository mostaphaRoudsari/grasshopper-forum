{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI'm pretty new to Grasshopper and Honeybee and I'm trying to run a daylight/energy analysis for custom shading. I want to calculate heat gain with the E+ analysis putting my shading in as context shading.\n\n\n\nThe analysis runs fine without the shading, but as soon as I connect the context shading component it fails. I've tried using some other breps as shading just to check if the problem is my shading geometry (is it possible that it's just too complicated?), however, so far, the only thing that worked was a plain cube.\n\nIf I aditionally connect a transparency schedule, even that fails. Depending on what I tried, I got all different kinds of warnings, so I don't really know what to do anymore.\n\n\n\nI've attached the file with the analysis. Hopefully somebody here can help me out.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1410046", "name": "Analyse Alu ohne Versatz eplus.gh"}], "created_by_name": "S221B", "created_at": "November 26, 2015 at 4:06am", "created_by": "S221B", "topic": "Problems with Honeybee E+ context shading component", "replies": [{"body": "\nP.S.\n\nthe shading will only be created correctly with the right Rhino-template, that is \"Meters for small objects\"\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "S221B", "created_at": "November 26, 2015 at 4:08am", "created_by": "S221B", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nNo ideas?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "S221B", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 1:17am", "created_by": "S221B", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi there,\n\n\n\nSorry about no one getting back to you about this.

At the moment, if\u00a0 I connect HB_context the simulation runs without producing an error message, however the Read_results components tell me \"1. The result file does not exist.\". I checked the folder they shoul be in and they really don't exist, which is no surprise, because the simulation runs suspiciously fast (2 minutes or so).\n\nI've also made up a new file with a somewhat simplified geometry and been playing around with the meshingSettings from the HBContext component as well es with the maximumFigure from the ShadowPar (at this point in my simulations I'm satisfied\u00a0 with relatively low-quality results). That one works fine, still takes a lot of time, sadly, but I guess there's just no way to get a really fast calculation for this kind of shading?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "S221B", "created_at": "December 1, 2015 at 6:04am", "created_by": "S221B", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nWith this kind of shading no there really isnt a way to do it quicker.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "December 1, 2015 at 7:05am", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nall right, thanks for taking the time to answer my questions!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "S221B", "created_at": "December 2, 2015 at 1:35am", "created_by": "S221B", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1410047"}
