Looking at your file your results are in kWh/m2.\n\nThe HB_readEPResult is giving you these units and not the units in the csv directly. True that you are getting crazy high results, but the problem is not the units.\n\nNow, i've checked your inputs and found that in the HB_setEPZoneLoads - ventilationPerArea input you gave inb the panel 0,00041 instead of 0.00041 (comma instead of point). That brings the results to something MUCH lower. Anyways you need to check if those results make sense.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 23, 2015 at 5:35am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nI second Abraham's suggestion.
