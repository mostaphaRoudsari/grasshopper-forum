{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nI recently opened up a honeybee/ladybug file today and tried to update it as per usual, however I am receiving an error stating: \"1. Solution exception:Authentication failed because the remote party has closed the transport stream.\"\u00a0\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same issue today, or what it means and how to troubleshoot.\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nAaron\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "October 21, 2014 at 12:42pm", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "topic": "Update Issue", "replies": [{"body": "\nI just downloaded the zip from github and it seems to be fine now.\u00a0\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "October 21, 2014 at 1:14pm", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Aaron, You are right.
