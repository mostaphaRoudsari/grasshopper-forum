No you can't. That's only because different analysis types has different result files. The component needs to know the type of the analysis so it calculates the right results. I can see that this can be confusing. Let me see if I can find a better solution for this.\n\n\n\n2. Yes! There is a recipe for annual analysis up there. Then use DSParameters and set output units to 1. The results will be annual radiation analysis using Daysim.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/NnMed0rJC6bQpYkbPMtL35N7uhPfuYgj7UW0-8FpM6V1jocd3*JeEv4on0VCf*Qm0exoWlUpZ1aGYFLsGDP-wWzhEm4Jj2jn/annualRadiationAnalysis.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NnMed0rJC6bQpYkbPMtL35N7uhPfuYgj7UW0-8FpM6V1jocd3*JeEv4on0VCf*Qm0exoWlUpZ1aGYFLsGDP-wWzhEm4Jj2jn/annualRadiationAnalysis.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 28, 2014 at 11:31am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nI was wandering if you could help me/us and show how you do this extrusion from mesh to present results.
