This will be good enough as long as you don't have a single zone with multiple floors.\n\n\n\nIf you are looking to generate it similar to the component a code like this should print the areas for you assuming Honeybee zones are connected to an input named HBZones.\n\n\n\nimport scriptcontext as sc\n\nhb_hive = sc.sticky[\"honeybee_Hive\"]()\n\n# call the objects from the hive\n\nzones = hb_hive.callFromHoneybeeHive(HBZones)\n\nfor zone in zones:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 print zone.getFloorArea()\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 19, 2016 at 2:40pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\n!!!\n\nwow\n\nok...\n\nthats not my languaje! lovely id like keep developing ldhb because its an awesome cocktail of tools, howerver it will be in diferent way at least for now. Right now im glad to increase this kind of documentation hoping can be useful for lbhb users.\n\nhey M\n\nI think the component can be useful for area tracking and input for math operations... like Mackey load videos...\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "jP Trujillo Levy", "created_at": "July 20, 2016 at 12:16pm", "created_by": "JuanPabloTrujilloLevy", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1568365"}
