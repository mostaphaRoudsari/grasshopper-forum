{"body": "\nChris and Mostapha,\n\n\n\nNow this seems to be a very weird bug.\n\n\n\nI ve been trying to figure out what is going on for the past 10 days!\n\nWhen there is a zone with a core in the middle, with rectangles referenced from Rhino or generated in GH, if the center rectangle centered to the outer rectangle the adjacency are not solved properly.\n\n\n\nIt seems to consider the inner walls as outside walls and make windows.\n\n\n\nIf you move the inside rectangle even a little bit, then it works!!!\n\n\n\nReally a mystery!\n\n\n\nI attach the relevant file for you to investigate.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1291045", "name": "HB_Zone_Center_Rectagle_Bug.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1291046", "name": "Honeybee_Zones_Centered_Bug.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "May 20, 2015 at 12:02pm", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Honeybee weird bug when creating zones", "replies": []}
