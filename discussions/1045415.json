{"body": "\nHello everybody,\n\n\n\nI encountered an annoying problem with glazing.\n\nI want to use the component Add Glazing in order to define all the glazed surface by myself (and not based on ratio). I succeeded in defining :\u00a0\n\n- HB surface (which is the surface on which the window is situated)\n\n- childsurfaces (the glazed surface)\n\n\n\nBut I don't know what's next. Could you help me solving this problem ?\n\nIf you have any better ideas to define the Glazing, don't hesitate !\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your answers !\n\n\n\nCheers\n\nR\u00e9da\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Radis", "created_at": "April 16, 2014 at 7:42am", "created_by": "Oussennan", "topic": "Add Glazing", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Oussennan,\n\nCan you explain what are you exactly trying to do? You can just use createHBSrfs\u00a0component and assign glass material to the surfaces.\n\nNevertheless if you added the glazing to the surface then you can use Run_Daylight Analysis and run the analysis for your geometry.\n\nIf you upload an example it will be much easier to help.\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 16, 2014 at 9:59pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi again R\u00e9da,\n\nI put an example file together that shows what I mentioned before.
