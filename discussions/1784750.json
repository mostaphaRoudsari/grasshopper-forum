This analysis establishes pressure and velocity at air inlets. As a second step, these pressure and or velocity are taken as boundary conditions to run a separate indoor analysis. I believe both types of analysis are possible with the Butterfly plugin.\n\nThanks,\n\nDevang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "on Wednesday", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Devang\n\nI am working with Ansys and there you just need to define some boundaries as \"Interior\" so the solution comes from outside to inside. Something that may vary within the condition you said is the angle of velocity specially as an transient stream, by the way, have you ever compared the results of Butterfly with a CFD simulation engine for one project? \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ehsan Fouladi", "created_at": "on Thursday", "created_by": "EhsanFouladi", "replies": []}]}]}
