This analysis establishes pressure and velocity at air inlets. As a second step, these pressure and or velocity are taken as boundary conditions to run a separate indoor analysis. I believe both types of analysis are possible with the Butterfly plugin.\n\nThanks,\n\nDevang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "July 19, 2017 at 10:44am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Devang\n\nI am working with Ansys and there you just need to define some boundaries as \"Interior\" so the solution comes from outside to inside.
