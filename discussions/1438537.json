{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha, Chris and all,\n\n\n\nI tried to run both daylight and energy simulations using a simple geometry. But I found the there is a huge difference between the results of the two different version of HB (0.056 and 0.058).\n\n\n\nIt looks really wired. Because I used exactly the same geometry, materials, and other settings, but the results are quite different. For instance, the DLA results in the two versions have two times difference, and the energy load (cooling load and heating load) are also different.\n\n\n\n**Could you please so kind to check the gh files in attachments, and let me know why there exists so big difference and which one is reliable?**\n\n\n\nThank you so much in advance!\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n\n\n\nOLD VERSION DLA RESULTS\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK-x5lgF7z2jnDpRKE2boW-tK*W5a-QaqBdtm5gKgoOVEhJZzfvpDrYrCYWJcBWcEkPaGKlUSznrR-zfPFNlItGh/oldversion.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK-x5lgF7z2jnDpRKE2boW-tK*W5a-QaqBdtm5gKgoOVEhJZzfvpDrYrCYWJcBWcEkPaGKlUSznrR-zfPFNlItGh/oldversion.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK8A1eDKlBxGtRtfl4*NMvyUL*sCIAMrf3w9NQNp2f7aEwfUtuGNJzHxrO4f7wK66w7M0MhsEUEh7oHR9Htgnn*U/DLAforoldversion_box.png\" width=\"433\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK8A1eDKlBxGtRtfl4*NMvyUL*sCIAMrf3w9NQNp2f7aEwfUtuGNJzHxrO4f7wK66w7M0MhsEUEh7oHR9Htgnn*U/DLAforoldversion_box.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW VERSION DLA RESULTS\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK-kxaxhanEAZJReTm-wXiLMND2*O-p4zyNO*qft21uTHxeEI8Io2H5wJmv*nBK6xYYmiguWfXaD3MmLTMHvMCpB/newversion.PNG\" width=\"684\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK-kxaxhanEAZJReTm-wXiLMND2*O-p4zyNO*qft21uTHxeEI8Io2H5wJmv*nBK6xYYmiguWfXaD3MmLTMHvMCpB/newversion.PNG)\n\n[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK9RlIDpxfAWniFR9*FBzHHppxvkIEn57qFT*bSv07x9M5mZN1qtW0Pc9bX*98s9uYyVbPcMhaXPgrE*lkcIl9*a/Energyforoldversion_box.png)\n\n[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK9RlIDpxfAWniFR9*FBzHHppxvkIEn57qFT*bSv07x9M5mZN1qtW0Pc9bX*98s9uYyVbPcMhaXPgrE*lkcIl9*a/Energyforoldversion_box.png)\n\n[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK9RlIDpxfAWniFR9*FBzHHppxvkIEn57qFT*bSv07x9M5mZN1qtW0Pc9bX*98s9uYyVbPcMhaXPgrE*lkcIl9*a/Energyforoldversion_box.png)\n\n[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK9RlIDpxfAWniFR9*FBzHHppxvkIEn57qFT*bSv07x9M5mZN1qtW0Pc9bX*98s9uYyVbPcMhaXPgrE*lkcIl9*a/Energyforoldversion_box.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK-4SHwQoukXDzB1nBkY2d2hluZRjH6UJVLdUwm8Jfo1zlzzKIE15qhnp9-HPDgIOJzOa6YKI7CUVk61s81vxNe7/DLAfornewversion_box.png\" width=\"408\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK-4SHwQoukXDzB1nBkY2d2hluZRjH6UJVLdUwm8Jfo1zlzzKIE15qhnp9-HPDgIOJzOa6YKI7CUVk61s81vxNe7/DLAfornewversion_box.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD VERSION ENERGY RESULTS\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK8LYEYfCpVUi-QxnxZlUPywvUKefCLodVlmRknvA13n*p8xdqmk6r3zzPSZRD4jUToAP61j9mnMHk7AbG8B-Hvv/Energyforoldversion_box.png\" width=\"605\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK8LYEYfCpVUi-QxnxZlUPywvUKefCLodVlmRknvA13n*p8xdqmk6r3zzPSZRD4jUToAP61j9mnMHk7AbG8B-Hvv/Energyforoldversion_box.png)\n\n\n\nNEW VERSION ENERGY RESULTS\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK*MmsB*Lxab7yBGiQpNmrZN24rVARmuRU*knsZUeYnEvp3pg-IMeSg4UDdBu-Q3oAWZpsZmSgex3e7qOivGj-Jv/Energyfornewversion_box.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J1MI0xqUUK*MmsB*Lxab7yBGiQpNmrZN24rVARmuRU*knsZUeYnEvp3pg-IMeSg4UDdBu-Q3oAWZpsZmSgex3e7qOivGj-Jv/Energyfornewversion_box.PNG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1438535", "name": "CASE_1(newversion)_box.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1438536", "name": "CASE_1(oldversion)_box.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "January 14, 2016 at 3:22am", "created_by": "doudou", "topic": "Large discrepancy of daylight and energy results between new and old versions", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ding, We are working on a new release for the 24th.
