{"body": "\nHi all, i have tricky issue to ask you about customizing Perez coefficient under ladybug/honeybee/Radiance. I need to improve the accuracy for solar radiation modelling for my projects. One of the solution is to adjust six sets of Perez coefficient using our measurement data for a whole year. I have checked source code of cumulative sky from ladybug and honeybee, but it seems the radiation modelling is built on Radiance gendaylit. So i checked the source code of gendaylit.c ([http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/gen/gend...](http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/gen/gendaylit.c?view=markup)), i found the constants coeff_perez[] that i need to replace by our coefficient. For this situation, is there anyone have experience that use customized Perez coefficients for ladybug or honeybee or Radiance?

The six coefficients under gendaylit.c is from line 25 (following the link of [http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/gen/gend...](http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/gen/gendaylit.c?view=markup)) as below:\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/aSfoUc8VkEE3vyEwI0NiDidyXzC6HARV7ldzuv5*V6hQk*s9whA2lFc-JxxV3Ic9PucsFZtdL5wxpjiXvsTPPAzEQOzJUS1X/perezcoefficientsundergendaylit.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/aSfoUc8VkEE3vyEwI0NiDidyXzC6HARV7ldzuv5*V6hQk*s9whA2lFc-JxxV3Ic9PucsFZtdL5wxpjiXvsTPPAzEQOzJUS1X/perezcoefficientsundergendaylit.JPG)\n\n\n\nfloat coeff_perez [] is from Perez's paper in solar energy vol. 50, No.3. pp235-245, 1993.\u00a0\n\n\n\ni would like to adjust A3, A4, A5, A6 and A7 using measurement irradiance data over a whole year for every minute or hour, and update these coefficients under the file perezlum.cal. It means i may need to re-compile gendaylit.exe, which i have no idea how to do it.\u00a0\n\n\n\ni found radiance has another version on gendaymtx.c v2.13. it includes static const double PerezCoeff[8][20]. I am wondering which version of gendaymtx does ladybug GenCumulativeSkyMtx use.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your suggestions on honeybee plugin.
