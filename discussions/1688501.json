{"body": "\nHi All!\n\n\n\nI know this is long in the running, and I keep forgetting to make a post (so I apologise!) but I thought I would take this time to post about my Master's of Building Science thesis published last year in May 2016 around the feasibility of implementing a program such as Honeybee into the building industry, using New Zealand as a case. Below is a short abstract of the study:\n\n\n\nI also attach a much shorter summary of my thesis in the form of a conference paper that I presented at the Architectural Science Association Conference in Adelaide, Australia last year. The paper was awarded the best student paper on building performance simulation.\n\n\n\nI would like to thank Mostapha, Chris, and the team in their help during my time learning the program! You guys have done an excellent job, and the program 'wow'ed all of the professionals that I showed the tool to.\n\n\n\nAs for what I have moved on to - I have since graduated with distinction and have been employed as a graduate at AECOM ltd. I am currently using the program on projects to enable architects to make more informed decisions that they don't normally have at the early stages of design. The program still has its challenges though, so you will see me on the forums a lot in the future !\n\n\n\nIf anyone has any questions or would like to know more, don't be afraid to ask. Find me on linkedn or contact me via here.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1688500", "name": "ASAElzineBraasch2016.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "February 9, 2017 at 5:59pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "A Master's Thesis: The Feasibility of Honeybee within New Zealand", "replies": [{"body": "\nElzine,\n\n\n\nWonderful paper.

Enjoyed reading the paper. It very well echoes the current sentiment in the industry. The paper made me recollect something a professor once shared. He said, \"If you're an architect and you think you need a Sustainable design consultant then there's something wrong.\" I believe in what he said. It is an architect's responsibility.\n\n\n\nI like the way engineers work. They always back their designs with analysis &amp; calculations. I often think architects could do the same with right education. When I discuss this with other architects, the common response is, \"But it may hinder the creative design process.\" However, I am not in agreement with that.\n\n\n\nA great read indeed. Thanks a lot!\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "February 11, 2017 at 4:59am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}]}
