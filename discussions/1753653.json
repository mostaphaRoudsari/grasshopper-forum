{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI'm relatively new to using honeybee, and I'm trying to solve a problem similar to this post:\n\n\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/surface-tem...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/surface-temperature-under-reflected-solar-heat-gain)\n\n\n\nI'm running an analysis based on the solution Chris Mackey posted in that thread, but I'm getting no data out of my daylight analysis for cumulative radiation values. I've attached my file with simplified geometry and the weather file that I am using. Any help would be much appreciated!\n\n<br/>Thanks\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1753651", "name": "Radiation_Test.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1753652", "name": "CHN_Guizhou.Guiyang.578160_CSWD.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Dennis Goff", "created_at": "May 18, 2017 at 10:45am", "created_by": "DennisGoff567", "topic": "Honeybee Daylight Analysis returning No radiation", "replies": [{"body": "\nI've made some headway getting it to return radiation information, but I'm seeing a different problem now.
