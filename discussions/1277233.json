Try going to the folder where the analysis file are saved, right click on the .bat file and type \"PAUSE\" at the end. Save it and then double click it.

If you search the group and online you will find an explanation for it.

Quality of your geometry, type of geometry, or geometry stretching outside radiance's bounding box around your geometry. Perhaps try including a ground plane that extends around your geometry or try expanding your test points outside your geometry?\n\n\n\nOr even better try what Mostapha is suggesting in the thread above :)\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 4:59am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nDear Theodore,\n\n\n\nIt can run when I disconnected \"context\" to HBSurface.\u00a0Maybe there is\u00a0a problem\u00a0with geometry of surrounding building\u00a0in the example file.
