When the zone is concave (L shape) this Distribution may give errors when set to Full Exterior and Interior\" (which i think is default value). You can control this parameter with the HB_EnergySimPar -- solarDistribution_ input (probably ti FullExterior only).\n\nRegarding the other discussion i have to say that i didn't understand well the question, so don't know what to suggest.
