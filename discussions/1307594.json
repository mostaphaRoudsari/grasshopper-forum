{"body": "\nHi all ,\u00a0\n\nI'm working hardly to finish my master's thesis , but stuck in the case study's energy simulation . I'm trying to have air temperature charts of building zones &amp; don't have problem with the main building but when I'm connecting the outer kinetic facade the simulation stops as in the attached pic .\n\nI made the outer facade as a zone as a first trail \u00a0&amp; couldn't have results . and made as shading device as second trail but can't have results also . so I need to know what is the problem with my file ?\u00a0\n\nnote :\u00a0\n\nI need to have results when the facade closed &amp; 50% opened &amp; 100%opened . so it's important to make the outer facade a part of the main building .\u00a0\n\n\u00a0If any one can help me so please find attached my case study file .&amp; Thank you In advance :)\n\nRegards,\u00a0\n\nMona Rezq\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1307593", "name": "Untitled.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "June 11, 2015 at 8:02pm", "created_by": "monarezk", "topic": "urgent , connecting kinetic facade problem", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mona. The image shows that simulation is running fine. There is no errors. The reason that it takes very long is probably the complex geometry of your shading which generates so many mesh faces. EnergyPlus is not really designed to handle so many shading faces.
