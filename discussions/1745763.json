{"body": "\nDear all,\u00a0\n\nWould you advise on how to get the right information out of ConditionalStatement? In the SunPath component, I set the conditional statement to 'a&gt;15' to show all sun positions where drybulb temperature is higher than 15 C, however, the sun path shows some values lower than 15 C (see below). I would appreciate if you tell me how to fix it to show only &gt; 15C. Find attached .gh file.\n\nThanks in advance for your help[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/sWrFHZQXnlWpebFbalLDm0PrmgC0t3gZnfPCsXxP9JrORxjbOlUO5W7MtQaQim53GE2Q1yyPnvLgSXDr5qkPfgZbQIQUviAk/CondicionalStatement.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/sWrFHZQXnlWpebFbalLDm0PrmgC0t3gZnfPCsXxP9JrORxjbOlUO5W7MtQaQim53GE2Q1yyPnvLgSXDr5qkPfgZbQIQUviAk/CondicionalStatement.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1745762", "name": "Condicional Statement.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Jose Luis", "created_at": "May 4, 2017 at 5:18pm", "created_by": "JoseLuis573", "topic": "Conditional Statement", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Jose,\n\nThis looks like a bug. We had one hour of discrepancy between data and sun position which is fixed recently. This might be happening because of that.
