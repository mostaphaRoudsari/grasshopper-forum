{"body": "\nHello guys and girls,\n\nI am getting really god at crashing rhino lately. So I am asking you for a little bit of help. I am doing a test to see if the location of different zones affects the energy outcome (thesis project) but when I put just the second level in - approx a total of 80 zones in total - it crashes when it should calculate the glazing. However it does it for the first 40 zones (first level) but not when I add the second level. So I am really puzzled to why is that - are there any settings I am skipping?\n\n\n\nAny crazy ideas are more than welcomed! I have added the definition for who wants to take a peak. ;)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SNF651yU0cXd6KOVTeDNFl5PMA9mxppXTgDzF-xDb0lUuMiwOSGyUmCuK8WDf9m64JqAAZ4zPN2vwUb8RsWiYtgU0bCUJtZ4/snitrhinoerror.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SNF651yU0cXd6KOVTeDNFl5PMA9mxppXTgDzF-xDb0lUuMiwOSGyUmCuK8WDf9m64JqAAZ4zPN2vwUb8RsWiYtgU0bCUJtZ4/snitrhinoerror.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1495214", "name": "29-03-2016.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Stefania Dinea", "created_at": "March 29, 2016 at 5:34am", "created_by": "StefaniaDinea", "topic": "Glazing - rhino crash", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Stefania,\n\n\n\n\u00a0I have no problem with adding glazing first before solve adjacency.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SNF651yU0cW19HKN5py3KipF9*IkReg-VCprf7xhL38lEjUO*ZzBIYbCD000fv3BymujGumGiTQlN54GI4ZXc4qzEVRzzqZo/Capture.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SNF651yU0cW19HKN5py3KipF9*IkReg-VCprf7xhL38lEjUO*ZzBIYbCD000fv3BymujGumGiTQlN54GI4ZXc4qzEVRzzqZo/Capture.PNG)\n\n-Mingbo\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1495221", "name": "29032016_edit.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mingbo Peng", "created_at": "March 29, 2016 at 6:50am", "created_by": "MingboPeng", "replies": [{"body": "\nsmart! thank you so much \u00a0- it never occurred to me to do it in reverse.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stefania Dinea", "created_at": "March 29, 2016 at 6:59am", "created_by": "StefaniaDinea", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nspoke to soon, have the same issue no matter how I turn and twist stuff.\u00a0[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SNF651yU0cXt-8HOyWyXCKrScZhs6TROCuRlzEyIQT8Mo8WBRRWnDoL*n7LjCE03CbY9Z5WXXSEc9I166AbhNNb4n7n3pqi5/lol2.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SNF651yU0cXt-8HOyWyXCKrScZhs6TROCuRlzEyIQT8Mo8WBRRWnDoL*n7LjCE03CbY9Z5WXXSEc9I166AbhNNb4n7n3pqi5/lol2.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stefania Dinea", "created_at": "March 29, 2016 at 9:08am", "created_by": "StefaniaDinea", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Stefina.
