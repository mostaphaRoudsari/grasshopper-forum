{"body": "\nHi, everyone,\n\n\n\nHave anyone met same problem in using \"window shade generator\" component:\n\nWhen choosing shade type=1(which means roller shade or metal screen), the component says,\"Solution exception:Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\".\n\nPlus, choosing type 0 and 2 is OK. Only 1 does not work.\n\nI have checked the component with a very simple case as below, but it still does not work. Can anyone help me?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/TkRyGB8XlNAvPw7jbZSEClxwyprk0-LXJeaLqROzXYuUiJMNoIzGA6T5gD7Q1ZMqpyg10-x8gaq4ziysltSADjoRL1maujRX/123.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/TkRyGB8XlNAvPw7jbZSEClxwyprk0-LXJeaLqROzXYuUiJMNoIzGA6T5gD7Q1ZMqpyg10-x8gaq4ziysltSADjoRL1maujRX/123.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nYours,\u00a0\n\nAnxiao\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1520480", "name": "HB_windw shade generator.gh"}], "created_by_name": "anxiao zhang", "created_at": "May 2, 2016 at 4:42am", "created_by": "anxiaozhang", "topic": "Problems with Honeybee_Energyplus window shade generator", "replies": [{"body": "\nAnxiao,\n\nYou were missing some inputs for the component to work.
