{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and group members,\n\n\n\nI have made a parametric model of a huge space like a train station's waiting room. The model is used for annual energy simulation of the space and the total solar radiation of the roof.\n\n\n\nThe solar radiation is OK, but the EP simulation failed.\n\n\n\nIs there something wrong with the model setting? Or because of the curved form? If so, what should I do to handle that?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1629536", "name": "Capture.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1629537", "name": "Case-Tju.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "October 31, 2016 at 4:52am", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "topic": "Problems about modelling a huge space with Honeybee Energy Simulation", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Xiaojian,\n\n\n\nPlease update your ladybug and honeybee first.\u00a0\n\nYou should simplify your curved surface to planner surface (especially those have glazing)\n\nEnergyPlus has some problems with concave\u00a0geometry, and you should break the entire hall into\u00a0several small zones, and keep each zone is convex.\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nMingbo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mingbo Peng", "created_at": "November 1, 2016 at 8:29am", "created_by": "MingboPeng", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mingbo,\n\n\n\nGreat thanks to your immediate reply and patient help.

I mean I am glad to have the result and grateful for your kind help. Meanwhile, I just felt curious about this issue. I checked the same issue in the discussion forum, \u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interior-so...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interior-solar-distribution-calculation), like this post.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo my question is, is it still my model's error or should I\u00a0run the simulation without interior reflections using the Energy Simulation Par component? If so, how to handle in the\u00a0Energy Simulation Par component.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/VQvbBACfG9owhdGzj1zsuOYZvetGnBK1nIlPLAwKioBhjKdVxKPdq0ExvAJ-8z6XVo4VTA09rT1CHeSrPCWghFKNCoS2YJip/2.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/VQvbBACfG9owhdGzj1zsuOYZvetGnBK1nIlPLAwKioBhjKdVxKPdq0ExvAJ-8z6XVo4VTA09rT1CHeSrPCWghFKNCoS2YJip/2.png)\n\n\n\nThank you again for your great help.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "November 2, 2016 at 6:58am", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Xiaojian,\n\n\n\nThis error happens quite common, usually because of your model with multi-zones.
