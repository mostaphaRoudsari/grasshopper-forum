{"body": "\nHello Ladybug Forum!\n\n\n\nI am attempting to analyze outdoor comfort for a project and account for the solar radiation. Using Ver 0.0.62, the SolarAdjustedTemperature default analysis period is noon for the winter solstice. I would like to calculate an hourly data set for a given time period so I attempted to use the 'analysisPeriod' component. When connected to the SolarAdjustedTemperature, it resulted in the following error: \"Local variable \"analysisTime\" referenced before assignment\".\u00a0\n\n\n\nI appreciate any advice in tackling this issue.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1506036", "name": "SolarAdjustedMRT error.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Kit Elsworth", "created_at": "April 11, 2016 at 10:34am", "created_by": "KitElsworth", "topic": "SolarAdjustedMRT and Analysis Period", "replies": [{"body": "\nKit,\n\nI cannot re-create the error on my machine. \u00a0The attached file is working fine for me.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4-r35uyukEZvpGB0MLg0cop8Rld7CKHEe**ILX*RWnaEvvd0Wko8k-0MDJQosejf9riL69uistFTBAHoHQuc9iMdvN-d*yNa/RadManOk.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4-r35uyukEZvpGB0MLg0cop8Rld7CKHEe**ILX*RWnaEvvd0Wko8k-0MDJQosejf9riL69uistFTBAHoHQuc9iMdvN-d*yNa/RadManOk.JPG)\n\nMy guess is that you might not have updated your components correctly. \u00a0If you upload your GH file, we can test to see if this is the case.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1506263", "name": "SolMRTOK.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 11, 2016 at 12:45pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Kit,\n\nIf you give us the line number for the error that can be a good starting point. There is probably a conditional statement in the code that doesn't let `analysisTime` to be set first in your case.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 11, 2016 at 4:14pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHi Chris + Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for replies. I believe it was a component version issue although I am hesitant to commit fully since I checked that the first time I rain into the error. Regardless, I did a fresh overhaul over the Ladybug and Honeybee components and it seemed to work after that. I may have had mismatching components before...perhaps a mix between the Jan26 and Jan28 updates.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kit Elsworth", "created_at": "April 27, 2016 at 8:00pm", "created_by": "KitElsworth", "replies": []}]}
