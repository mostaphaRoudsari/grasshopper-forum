{"body": "\nHi I have run a VSC simulation in a courtyard creating HB zones and using the HB component and I get higher values towards the corners, which does not make sense.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/u-nuBgwJg3wZCD*0VF8wwJI*J4A5vHcFaY4G2I4WQ4Ts78VezNNdBnttQlUe07As0Z6aY03iA-fK34QAUpxrulwYIQnSQr7H/2.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/u-nuBgwJg3wZCD*0VF8wwJI*J4A5vHcFaY4G2I4WQ4Ts78VezNNdBnttQlUe07As0Z6aY03iA-fK34QAUpxrulwYIQnSQr7H/2.jpg)\n\nOn the other hand if I introduce the geometry as HB objects instead of creating HB zones, the results are different (which in theory should not because its the same geometry) and more sensible (lower toward the corners).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/u-nuBgwJg3wBdPTY92BCvfrdMvO7*ICZzaCnzKW9BiQdC*1Y1C4423CnjML5bJTo98nfxa4papNeaGR3P28Nf0a9TbxvMkVD/1.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/u-nuBgwJg3wBdPTY92BCvfrdMvO7*ICZzaCnzKW9BiQdC*1Y1C4423CnjML5bJTo98nfxa4papNeaGR3P28Nf0a9TbxvMkVD/1.jpg)\n\nIs this a bug or am I maybe overlooking something?\n\nRegards,\n\nAlejandro\n\n(script attached)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1181818", "name": "Error VCS.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "December 5, 2014 at 5:00am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "VSC component - inconsistent results", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Alejandro, Output of DecomposeZone is a Grasshopper geometry and not a Honeybee object, so when you connect it to runDaylightAnalysis component it won't be exported to rad file. I used importRAD to import the file back and see what is going on. As you can see only shading surface gets exported.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KzOvBNTGFEGlXg7Y27-HSwl*fFiVLo1q638tLsDw1jTXGzXztmHlAaJGDj8fNTaJ6v9PEZP*xOnFjpaDDuPqotw*63-Brfkh/HBObjects.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KzOvBNTGFEGlXg7Y27-HSwl*fFiVLo1q638tLsDw1jTXGzXztmHlAaJGDj8fNTaJ6v9PEZP*xOnFjpaDDuPqotw*63-Brfkh/HBObjects.png)\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: I understand that it may make more sense to change outputs of DecomposeZoneBasedOnType to be HBSurfaces and not Breps. Your current workflow should have worked.
