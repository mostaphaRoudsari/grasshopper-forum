{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI have a simple question. I am creating a single HB zone by creating HB-Surfaces.\n\nWhen I get the area of my HB_Surface floor or ceiling, it shows 103 m2, but when I get the area of my HB_Zone, the area changes to 382 m2.\n\nMy units in Rhino is meters.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDoes honeybee change/convert units, when we create zones out of surfaces?\n\n\n\nThanks\u00a0\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1648726", "name": "HB_Area.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1648727", "name": "9-Successful_SingleZoneIntegratedDLandEnergy_Schedule.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 29, 2016 at 2:57pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "Unit Conversion Issue in HB", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ladan,\n\nIf you take area of HB_Zone, it will be the\u00a0total of areas of all HB_Surfaces. Which in your case is 382.001281 m2.\u00a0So it seems totally correct.\n\n-Devang\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "November 29, 2016 at 3:14pm", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "\nAs Devang pointed out, Grasshopper Area component gives you the area of the input geometry, in your case Brep, which is the area of all the surfaces.
