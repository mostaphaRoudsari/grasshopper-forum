{"body": "\nI also trying to analyze complex geometries using honeybee and have hit this issue of how to handle meshes... I have a complex wall that is a mesh and I want to run daylight analysis the slab behind it. I am trying to create a HBsurface from the mesh. Can Msh2RAD do that? Is there a way to make a mesh into a HB surface?
