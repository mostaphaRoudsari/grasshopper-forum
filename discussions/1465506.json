{"body": "\nHi All.<br/><br/>I have recently been diving into LB+HB.<br/>After a slight bumb its now running smoothly (wuhoo great work devs) and I am making template files for the architecture office i'm working at. <br/><br/>A colleague made an interesting question:Is it possible to run the simulation in silent mode?<br/>So the cmd.exe shell window does not pop up?\n\n\n\nThis made me think: Is it possible to make the shell window hidden and somehow pass a progress status from the simulation into grasshopper?<br/>So it would be possible to make a \"Simulation running\" pop up in the grasshopper window or in the 3D viewport until its done.\n\nThis would make the experience of using LB+HB very smooth in everyday uses. And could be nothing more than a Boolean value. Output:\"simulation running\" -&gt; True or False\n\n\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ejnar Brendsdal", "created_at": "February 18, 2016 at 2:03am", "created_by": "EjnarBrendsdal", "topic": "Running Simulation in silent mode?

If you don't want to see command shell, you should write \"2\" into a panel component and connect it to runEnergyPlus_. However, when you run simulations your machine will be frozen, thus you cannot edit your workflow anyway.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cLrAd6kUb1BWn3Oyp6zZ4ZBt9FUZPQKzplEYoEoKNVn8JCtXZCDzXory*PhI0C0cj9gks0e7fAJEzfgKUd85NXZq2w*zrbNi/background_runEP.png?width=550\" width=\"550\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cLrAd6kUb1BWn3Oyp6zZ4ZBt9FUZPQKzplEYoEoKNVn8JCtXZCDzXory*PhI0C0cj9gks0e7fAJEzfgKUd85NXZq2w*zrbNi/background_runEP.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nBest<br/>Antonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "February 18, 2016 at 5:42am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": [{"body": "\nand somehow pass a progress status from the simulation into grasshopper?\n\n\n\nIt should be possible to push it to Rhino actually however it's not possible in Grasshopper.
