{"body": "\nHello there. I am working on a definition to simulate the daylight for different building shapes. The definition was working pretty well, but since I added the Split Building Mass component, the simulation doesn't work anymore. The component turns red and give the error message \"Solution exception: 'nonetype' object has no attribute \"Transform\". I tried to test the same component in a smaller definition, with a simpler geometry and I had the same message, except that the \"Transform\" was changed by \"X\". Can anyone help me with this error?\n\n\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1567681", "name": "DEFINI\u00c7\u00c3O ERRO SPLIT BUILDING MASS.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Andressa L.

I want to create windows by building levels (like in the link below that I sent).
