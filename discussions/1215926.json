If you have an old version of LB+HB, download the file here ([https://app.box.com/s/ds96em9l6stxpcw8kgtf](https://app.box.com/s/ds96em9l6stxpcw8kgtf))<br/> and open it in Grasshopper to remove your old Ladybug and Honeybee version.<br/> 1. Make sure that you have a working copy of both Rhino and Grasshopper installed.<br/> 2. Open Rhino and type \"Grasshopper\" into the command line (without quotations). Wait for grasshopper to load.<br/> 3. Install GHPython by downloading the file at this link ([http://www.food4rhino.com/project/ghpython?ufh](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/ghpython?ufh)) and<br/> drag the .gha file onto the Grasshopper canvas.<br/> 4. Select and drag all of the files in the \"userObjects\" folder (downloaded with this instructions file)<br/> onto your Grasshopper canvas. You should see Ladybug and Honeybee appear as tabs on the grasshopper tool bar.<br/> (If you are reading this instruction on github you can download them from [http://www.food4rhino.com/project/ladybug-honeybee](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/ladybug-honeybee))<br/> 5. Download the files at this link ([https://app.box.com/s/bh9sbpgajdtmmystv3n4](https://app.box.com/s/bh9sbpgajdtmmystv3n4)), unzip them and copy the contents<br/> to both C:\\ladybug and C:\\Users\\[yourUsername]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug.<br/> 6.
