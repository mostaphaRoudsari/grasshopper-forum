{"body": "\nIs it possible to create laminated glass with Sentryglas interlayers by using the EP Construction component? I've had a a lot of success creating IGU's so I'm hopeful I can make laminated glass without just plugging in values for the EP window material component. If it is possible, how would I create a material for the interlayer (as it is not an opaque material, glass material, or air gap)?\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\nAaron\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "May 14, 2015 at 1:19pm", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "topic": "Laminated Glass", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Aaron,\n\nI don't know the answer to this question myself. Doing a quick search I found these two:\n\nThis paper suggests using simplified method ([http://gaia.lbl.gov/btech/papers/2804.pdf](http://gaia.lbl.gov/btech/papers/2804.pdf))\n\nYou can also use Window to generate the material data ([http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/pa...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/page-010.html))\n\nMy suggestion for you is to send your question to (unmethours.com).\n\n-Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 12, 2015 at 6:41am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}
