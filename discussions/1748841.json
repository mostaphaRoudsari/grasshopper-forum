It had been a long day and night, which lead to a frustrated and short message. Anyhow I really like your opinion upon the problem.\u00a0<br/><br/>I have tried for someday to simulate an outdoor wind flow of my own rhino model (Importet from sketchup). Beforehand i went through a tutorial of\u00a0[Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0holrRypJilkFo-Dv4JsQ), and everything worked during that tutorial with a provided grasshopper example file for this situation of an outdoor simulation.<br/><br/>Then I tried to simulate upon my own, and got everything to work just fine until the Solution component from Butterfly. Suddenly my Rhino model disappeared and I wasn't able to see if it was working. Still the Solution component was still running, but without any visible content in Rhino.<br/><br/>What could have gone wrong?\u00a0<br/><br/>Kind Regards<br/>Christoffer\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoffer Thor Paulsen", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 10:59am", "created_by": "ChristofferThorPaulsen", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Christoffer,\n\n\n\nI'll go through your model today and let you know if I find something.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the simulation is running while Rhino has dissapeared sounds like Rhino closed with some error but the VM was still running (it does that, even after we close the docker window).\n\nI'll check the file and see what I find.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 5:09pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks Theodore!\n\nChristoffer, Can you share a screenshot on how does it happen?
