{"body": "\nI am having a curious situation.\n\nI have a building made from a curve that is extruded in the z direction. From what I understand it is best to simplify this curve into a poly line. So in gh I \u00a0divide the curve and create a closed polyline from the points. I make a surface then extrude it , then make hbzones then pass the zones to grizzlybear. I get this error:\n\n1. Solution exception:'hb_EPZoneSurface' object has no attribute 'punchedGeometry'\n\n\u00a0\n\nwhat doe this mean???\n\n\u00a0\n\n{0;0}<br/> 0. not logging<br/> 1. Runtime error (MissingMemberException): 'hb_EPZoneSurface' object has no attribute 'punchedGeometry'<br/> 2. Traceback:<br/> line 5601, in checkZoneSurface, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/> line 5311, in evaluateZones, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/> line 1645, in script\n\n\u00a0\n\nHowever when I bake the polyline and manually redraw it in rhino and then reset the initial curve to this new manually drawn polyline the gbxml is created!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAny advice is appreciated.
