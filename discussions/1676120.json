However, in your case, your floor is a non-convex surface so my guess is that component will not give you the desired result. The best things would be to create closed volumes manually based on orientation, thermal configuration, etc and then take them in Honeybee using Honeybee_ Masses2Zones component.\n\n-Devang\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "January 22, 2017 at 1:23am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "January 22, 2017 at 10:14am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nI have divided the floor into zones and started working on it.\u00a0\n\nThe HB decompose component\u00a0wont\u00a0show the 'roof' (which is actually a floor since this plan is a part of a high rise building. if HB detects it as a roof then the calculations might change. please help me with that as well!)\n\nI am unable to get the\u00a0energyplus\u00a0running due to certain errors. not sure whats causing it.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1677033", "name": "sample floor.gh"}], "created_by_name": "nishant pandav", "created_at": "January 23, 2017 at 12:47pm", "created_by": "nishantpandav", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Nishant,\n\nPlease find file attached.
