{"body": "\nThis is kind of pissing me off. The file was working properly a few minutes ago, with wrong results due to bad geometry.\n\n\n\nAfter taking out the invalid brep, I managed to assign materials and preview all of my geometry properly. Then I just re-run the simulation and I get this index out of range error.\n\n\n\nRadiance mailing lists didn't help a lot, most mentioned material assignment issues or placing some geometry outside your scene in order to expand the bounding box.\n\n\n\nI checked the materials file all seems ok. I vaguely remember seeing it before but can't recall how I solved it. I tried taking off the ground plane, and using the hbzone with standard radiance materials, nothing changed. Components are also updated to the last github.Any ideas why this is happening?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1256963", "name": "ExitRetail.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 5, 2015 at 10:39pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Index Out Of Range radiance error (truncate octree failure)", "replies": [{"body": "\nThe issue is undefined modifier \"Air_Wall\"\n\nYou need to define Air_Wall construction for Radiance model.
