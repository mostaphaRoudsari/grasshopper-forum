{"body": "\nHey Guys,\u00a0\n\nI seem to be having a peculiar problem with Lady bug. I'm trying to get sunlight hours for a list of geometries but the result seems to be incorrect. It would seem that I would see more solar hours on the south side but every time I run the simulation the result shows the south side to have the least number of sun light hours. I have attached the .gh file below along with the epw file. You might have to load the epw twice. Would really appreciate the help.\u00a0\n\nThank you!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1465430", "name": "facade study.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1465431", "name": "USA_CA_Los.Angeles.722950_TMY2.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Perry White", "created_at": "February 17, 2016 at 2:11pm", "created_by": "PerryWhite", "topic": "Lady Bug sunlight hours result not accurate", "replies": [{"body": "\nPerry,\n\nThe normal direction of the surface indicates the orientation and not their relative position in Rhino scene. In your case the normal directions are backwards so the surfaces located on the south side are actually facing north. Flip the surfaces and use them as test geometries.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/VmQph4T03Lx5kZjY3UEu2I4h59Jo*zCuvbjdUiUc2kwJQDhNanfwPoAcR0vzspllUc4Z7Ogt5WdQg44ZeCzyEiLH--mJkfbV/sunlighthours_surfacenormal.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/VmQph4T03Lx5kZjY3UEu2I4h59Jo*zCuvbjdUiUc2kwJQDhNanfwPoAcR0vzspllUc4Z7Ogt5WdQg44ZeCzyEiLH--mJkfbV/sunlighthours_surfacenormal.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 17, 2016 at 3:51pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nSo I flipped the faces but now all the faces are mono color.
