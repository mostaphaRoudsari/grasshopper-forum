{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nGreetings from India for an amazing developments on ladybug and honeybee,\u00a0\n\nbasically i'm trying to optimize the fins on the surface to reduce the radiation levels on the facade, I have taken little help from your definition of room orientation optimization, And i have used octopus first time to optimize the fins size, but i dont know why i'm getting negative values after the simulation. I think there is something wrong i did in the script. please help!\u00a0\n\nthank you\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1451222", "name": "fins optimization.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "mia", "created_at": "January 31, 2016 at 7:57am", "created_by": "kartikmisra", "topic": "Fins optimization study", "replies": [{"body": "\nCan you upload a screenshot of the case where you get negative values?

I have used octopus to the first time, i have tried to minimize thradiation through optimizing the length and the rotation of the fins. it will be great if you can see if what ever is scripted is going the right way,.\n\nWarm regards!.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1452008", "name": "fins optimization.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1452009", "name": "Capture.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "mia", "created_at": "February 1, 2016 at 11:06am", "created_by": "kartikmisra", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi M[I]A,\n\nGenerally speaking it looks good but you probably want to connect fins to context and not test geometries. Currently fins are also connected to geometries and the amount of radiation on them is also included in your study.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 5, 2016 at 9:54pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}]}
