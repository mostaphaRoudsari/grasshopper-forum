{"body": "\nHi Honeybee team,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if it's possible to run the annual / daysim simulation in -dds mode, where instead of 65 sun positions the software considers 2305 sun positions? It would increase accuracy by quite a bit. (And if you use -dds -s option, you get climate-dependent sun positions).\u00a0\n\n\n\nIs there some way to hack that or would it require a big change in the simulation recipe component?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reinier Zeldenrust", "created_at": "March 9, 2015 at 2:07pm", "created_by": "ReinierZeldenrust", "topic": "Daysim -dds option", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Reinier,\n\nI assume the implementation should be pretty easy but I need to double check and make sure it is really implemented to the released version of Daysim. Have you tested it?\u00a0\n\nIn theory all you need to do is to add -dss and -dss -s when you are calling gen_dc and dc_illum.\n\n\n\ngen_dc filename.hea **-dds**\n\nds_illum filename.hea **-dds [-s]**\n\n\n\n([http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Presentations/Radianc...](http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Presentations/Radiance%20WS2009_DaysimInnovations_CReinhart.pdf))\n\n\n\nI'm personally looking forward to applying 3-phase method to Honeybee soon but this should be easy enough to implement. If you can do the initial test runs and make sure the results make sense I can go ahead and add it to Honeybee.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 9, 2015 at 3:16pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for your response.

It provides similar functionalities, and much more, with a higher level of flexibility and [potentially] accuracy. We will discontinue supporting Daysim at some point soon once we make sure the daylight coefficient and 3-Phase recipes are stable.\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 5, 2016 at 9:01pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks a lot Mostapha,\n\nvery helpful and superfast response!\n\nI will wait for this implementation so, meanwhile could be better to use E+ for solar radiation analysis cause the the sky model should be more accurate (continuous function) since it's using Perez sky model..isn't it?\n\nThanks!\n\nNic\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "falko", "created_at": "December 6, 2016 at 1:57am", "created_by": "falko", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1239564"}
