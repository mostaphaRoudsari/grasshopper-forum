{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI was trying to disable zone sizing calculation for a parametric model I wanted to run in order to reduce the calculation time (it really is almost 80% of the total time since I'm almost doing a dummy model with 1 week duration).\n\n\n\nHowever, I think I am running into this issue [https://unmethours.com/question/3054/disable-zoneplantsystem-sizing/](https://unmethours.com/question/3054/disable-zoneplantsystem-sizing/).\n\n\n\nI disable zone sizing from simulation parameters but the OS component still does it, probably due to the reasons mentioned in the post above. Their solution was to delete the design days from the .idf file but I don't want to (yet) go into .idf files. Is there any workaround currently in HB? I can easily be missing something.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "December 6, 2016 at 8:39pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Disabling zone sizing", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 8, 2016 at 5:51am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}], "id": "1653181"}
