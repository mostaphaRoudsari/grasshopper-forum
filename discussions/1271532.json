{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI am a novice user of you awesome plug-in. Currently I am using it in a project for which the corresponding weather data file for its specific location is not freely available. I found out that Whitebox Technologies sells IWEC2 historical weather data files (BINM, EPW (plus DDY file), and FIN4 text formats) for that particular location, but only in a year range from 2001 to 2012. Is this time frame reliable enough for running simulations using LB. Thank You!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland D.

IWEC has minimum range of 12 years. But not all years were taken into account from this range. <br/>So the larger the range, the better the weather sample, but I would say if you can't find better than that, 10 year range will do the job.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "April 23, 2015 at 3:07pm", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Djordje,\n\n\n\nThank you for your answer. So, if I purchase the 2012 historical year file, it contains average weather data from the las 12 years, would this be enough?\n\nAnother option White Box Technologies gives is generating a composite-year historical weather data files, which is to compose a single file joining multiple periods through switchover dates (i.e. from 1/1/2001 to 5/15/2001 with 5/16/2004 to 12/31/2004), which seems to be a good option when no complete years are available. However in my case, as all years are complete do you think composing a month by month file through the 12 year available\u00a0period (using a month from each year consecutively) could be a better option?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland D.

So when they say \"year range from 2001 to 2012\" it literally means they have an hourly annual data for each of 2001 to 2012 years. I would say that this kind of data is not suited for simulations we are performing.<br/>On composite year historical data, you can't simply concatenate months from different years. [Users Manual for TMY3 Data Sets](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43156.pdf), section \"2 Procedures for Developing TMY3\" provides an insight into different methods by which months from particular years were picked and concatenated to form TMY datasets.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "April 25, 2015 at 4:33pm", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHo Roland,\n\nIt looks like Djordje has got your issue covered but I just wanted to make sure that you were aware that there are a lot of non-DOE epw files available here if you create a yahoo account and join the E+ group:\n\n[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/EnergyPlus_Support/files/Meteon...](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/EnergyPlus_Support/files/Meteonorm_Weather_Files/)\n\nThere might be something there that is closer to what you are looking for than the DoE site.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 12:59pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\n\n\nWhat if WeatherAnalytics and White Box Technologies are not the options available.
