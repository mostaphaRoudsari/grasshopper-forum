{"body": "\nHello, I am working on my first energy model using Honeybee. \u00a0I am trying to see if there is a faster way to create core and perimeter zones rather than drawing them out in Rhino (which I'm also quite new to using).\n\nMy question is about the SplitMass component. \u00a0On each level of the building I am modelling I know that there will be an unconditioned plant room on one end (along the perimeter). \u00a0Is it possible to use the SplitMass component to generate core &amp; perimeter zones for just the conditioned masses? \u00a0When I use it, the component doesn't \"know\" there is an unconditioned zone next to the conditioned one, so it generates a perimeter zone along what is actually an internal wall.\n\nIs there a way to signal to the component that one side of the conditioned room is against an unconditioned space, so it doesn't need a perimeter zone there? \u00a0Or is there another method for creating zones that I should be using?\n\nI've attached a sample gh script with screenshots of the actual zones that come out and the zones that I want (apologies for the ms paint-level drawing!).\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1773959", "name": "SplitMassesQuery.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1773960", "name": "RhinoSS_Actual.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1773961", "name": "RhinoSS_Desired.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Priya Gandhi", "created_at": "June 25, 2017 at 4:03am", "created_by": "PriyaGandhi", "topic": "Using SplitMasses on some masses next to unconditioned zones", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Priya, Since split mass happens before creating the zones it doesn't know which zone is conditioned and which one is not.
