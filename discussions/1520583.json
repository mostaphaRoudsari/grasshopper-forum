From the Thermal Comfort Indices component, Comfort Index 11 (TCI-11):<br/>MRT = f(Ta, Tground, Rprim, e)\n\nwith:<br/>- Ta = DryBulbTemperature coming from ImportEPW component<br/>- Tground = f(Ta, N) where N comes from totalSkyCover input. Tground influences the long-wave radiation emitted by the ground in the MRT calculation.<br/>- Rprim defined as solar radiation absorbed by nude man = f(Kglob, hS1, ac)<br/>- ac is the clothingAlbedo in % (bodyCharacteristics input)<br/>- I can't find any definition in the code of Kglob and hS1. Could you tell me please what are those values referencered to? --&gt; probably the globalHorizontalRadiation but how?<br/>- e = vapour pressure calculated from Ta and Relative Humidity input\n\nDo you agree that in this case the MRT does not depend on these inputs: location, meanRadiantTemperature, dewPointTemperature and wind speed?<br/>It does not depend neither on the other bodyCharacteristics like bodyPosture, age, sex, met, activityDuration...?\n\nMRT calculated by the TCI-11 method is the mean radiant temperature of a vector pointing vertically with a sky view factor of 100%?<br/>For ParisOrly epw,\n\n2. From the SolarAdjustedTemperature component (that seems to be more used for the UTCI calculation examples on Hydra compared to TCI-11).\n\nIn contrast to the TCI-11, this component distinguishes diffuse and direct radiation and contextualizes the calculation thanks to _ContextShading input, right? <br/>It can also be applied to a mannequin thanks to the CumSkyMatrix and thus evaluate the dishomogeneity of radiation exposure.<br/>This component seems not to consider the influence of vapour pressure on the result --&gt; is it then more precise to put the MRT output (from the TCI) as an input of meanRadTemperature for SolarAdjustedTemperature?<br/>The default groundReflectivity is set to 0.25 --&gt; is GroundReflectivity taken into account in the Tground or MRT calculation in the TCI component? If yes, what is the hypothesised groundReflectivity?<br/>The default clothing albedo of 37% (TCI-11 bodyCharacteristics) corresponds to Clothing Absorptivity of 63%?\n\nIf the CumSkyMatrix input is not supplied, <br/>I get 9 results for the mannequin --&gt; where are those points/results coming from?\n\nIf the CumSkyMatrix input is supplied,<br/>I suppose the calculation of the 482 results correspond to a calculation method similar to the radiation analysis component that is averaged over the analysis period. Right?<br/>But I don't understand why the mannequin is composed of 481 faces and meshFaceResult gives 482 results.\n\nFinally, what is the link between the MESH results, the solarAdjustedMRT and the Effective Radiant field ? Is there a paper to have a detailed explanation of the method?\n\n<br/>3. Here are some results for the ParisOrly energyplus weather data.

Kglob is Global horizontal radiation from the .epw file, in W/m2.<br/>hSl is the sun elevation angle in degrees.\n\n<br/>Do you agree that in this case the MRT does not depend on these inputs: location, meanRadiantTemperature, dewPointTemperature and wind speed?\n\nIt depends on location, as location determines the sun vector's elevation, zenith and azimuth angles.<br/>It does not depend on meanRadiantTemperature, dewPointTemperature and windSpeed.\n\n<br/>It does not depend neither on the other bodyCharacteristics like bodyPosture, age, sex, met, activityDuration...?\n\nI think you are correct.

Outdoor Solar Adjusted Temperature Calculator component's feature of being able to evaluate different parts of the body is indeed impressive.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the TCI-11, this component distinguishes diffuse and direct radiation and contextualizes the calculation thanks to _ContextShading input, right?\n\nMRT in Thermal Comfort Indices component is based on Man-Environment Heat Exchange Model 2005 by Krzysztof Blazejczyk, one of the authors of UTCI index. MRT MENEX 2005 model has 4 version of solar radiation accounting. I am using the one with global solar radiation. The reason is because it cooperates well with other indices in the component, those that require solar radiation as an input.<br/>I implemented the MRT MENEX 2005 version which separatelly takes into account the direct, diffuse and reflected radiation in the attached file below.<br/>You can read more about the MRT and the whole MENEX 2005 model in general in the .pdf paper attached below.\n\n\n\nThe default groundReflectivity is set to 0.25 --&gt; is GroundReflectivity taken into account in the Tground or MRT calculation in the TCI component? If yes, what is the hypothesised groundReflectivity?\n\nThe MENEX 2005 model does not provide this information, but I assume that it's possibly 0.2 - 0.25 as you said, which is widely used as urban/suburban default annual average albedo value.\n\n\n\nThe default clothing albedo of 37% (TCI-11 bodyCharacteristics) corresponds to Clothing Absorptivity of 63%?\n\nYou are correct again.\n\n\n\nWhy such a big difference and which of the result should be plugged into the UTCI calculation component?\n\nThis is a complex question.<br/>One of the reasons might be the fact that MENEX MRT version is using a simplified formula to calculate the ground temperature, which may significantly affect the final results. It could be beneficial if groundTemperature_ is set as an input.<br/><br/>Another reason why this might be is that the\u00a0[study](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/89m1h2dg#page-4) which corrects the Mrt for the influence of local heating of the sunlit parts of the floor, is meant to be used for indoor analysis.<br/>It should be said that a number of outdoor indices have been derived from indoor indices and studies, but with edition of its parameters.<br/>In this case we are simply applying the same indoor formulas to outdoor analysis. The study itself does not provide any suggestion that this kind of approach may be valid.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1523897", "name": "Comparaison_MRT2.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1523898", "name": "MENEX_2005_Blazejczyk.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "May 6, 2016 at 1:37am", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks a lot Djordje for your answer!

here. \u00a0I think that I can explain where the difference between the two components is coming from and I have realized that I have been making a very misleading assumption in my example files that I intend to correct immediately.\n\n\n\nI can assure you that both the SolarCal and MENEX models are applicable to the outdoors (even though I know that the authors of SolarCal do not explicitly state this in their paper).\n\n\n\nThe key difference between the two MRT methods (and corresponding components) is that the \"solar adjusted temperature\" component assumes that you have already computed a starting MRT for long wave radiation in the absence of any short wave radiation. \u00a0True to its name, the component only adds a MRT delta to this long wave MRT to account for additional short wave radiation from the sun. \u00a0On the other hand, the MENEX model and the Thermal Comfort Indices component are doing a full long wave radiation balance in addition to the short wave radiation balance to give you a MRT for a person standing out in a field under an open sky.\n\n\n\nThe Thermal Comfort Indices component was giving much lower MRT values because it accounts for the fact that the sky (in the absence of sun) tends to be at a much lower perceived temperature than the air at Earth's surface or the ground (since the temperature of clouds and other objects higher in the atmosphere are cooler than those at the surface). \u00a0The great misleading assumption that I have been making in my example files is that, by plugging in the EPW dryBulbTemperature into the \"solar adjusted temperature\" component, I have been assuming that the temperature of the sky is the same as the temperature in the EPW air, which is almost never the case for the reason that I just stated.\n\n\n\nI have just added an option for a long wave radiation balance into the \"solar adjusted temperature\" component with [this github commit](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/2261a222787f42016a763208f9da7b04f339bdca). \u00a0You can see below and in the attached file that the solar adjusted component can now give results that align more closely with the MRT of the thermal indices component:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8p51V5ywRUKGdLMHaVe9XPVDFWO0o2AhwtWYJ4Yj0NHobSw6K2lwHP*vse9FnMIOSwZheB5qXOOXFB6-7wxD3gUpD0OD8W-v/MRTDifferences.JPG?width=721\"

two components is not much more than 1 degree C and the only major differences occur at high levels of solar radiation. \u00a0This is to be expected given that the SolarCal method is doing a much more detailed approximation of short wave radiation falling on the human than the MENEX model, which I believe is approximating the geometry of the human body with a cylinder and only differentiating between a few solar angles.\n\n\n\nOver the next few hours, I am going to correct my outdoor comfort example files and ensure that I am also accounting for sky temperature in the outdoor microclimate maps. \u00a0I will post back here once I do so.\n\n\n\nThanks again for bringing this up and for all of the knowledge you have shared.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link":

safe to say now that the bug has been squashed. \u00a0I can also confirm that all of the difference between the Thermal Comfort Indices component and the Solar Adjusted Temperature component has to do with the amount of shortwave radiation falling on the occupant (the long wave radiation balances are matching well). \u00a0Djordje, I think that the use of the globalHorizontalRaditiaion formula instead of the one that separates direct and diffuse radiation might be causing the thermal comfort indices component to underestimate the amount of shortwave radiation on the occupant by a small amount. \u00a0This said, the occupant geometry can influence the amount of shortwave radiation so much that I think this underestimation is fine given all of these typical unknowns of occupant

The added correction \"(1 + 0.22*((N/10)**2.75))\" is a fractional cloudiness factor by Maykut and Church (I attached the publication below which mentions it).\n\n<br/>So the emissivity coefficient of the (cloudy) sky is now:\n\nepsilon_sky = (0.82 - 0.25*(10**(-0.094*0.75*e))) * (1 + 0.22*((N/10)**2.75))\n\nI do not think that you could use the same value to calculate the sky temperature with Stefan-Boltzmann law, as the incoming long-wave radiation has been derived from the air temperature (2 meters above the ground), not the sky temperature.

thanks to your publications that I have been abusing the word \"sky temperature\" to mean something other than how it is traditionally used. \u00a0I was using it to refer only to the long wave radiation loss and not to the full radiative balance to the sky. \u00a0As such, I will refrain from using this term here on out.\n\n\n\nMore importantly, a very knowledgeable friend of mine who maintains the [Urban Weather Generator](https://github.com/hansukyang/UWG_Matlab)\u00a0just recently enlightened me to the fact that all EPW files that contain radiation (which is essentially all EPW files for our purposes) also contain actual recorded values for the long wave ambient (La) term that we have been trying to derive from relative humidity, cloud cover, and air temperature. \u00a0Specifically, the field is called \"Horizontal Infrared Radiation Intensity\" and you can see it shows up in the EPW documentation as field N12 [here](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/auxiliary-programs/energyplus-weather-file-epw-data-dictionary.html). \u00a0My friend was using this infrared value from the EPW to simulate urban heat balances and he told me that this is more accurate than trying to derive the radiative loss from humidity and cloud cover as this measured value already accounts for all things the could prevent long wave loss to space (including cloud cover and wayer vapor among other smaller things). \u00a0As such, I have modified the \"Import EPW\" component to now bring in this infrared data with [this commit](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/d3d92748c10c18aaa4972072ae82ba94d8a96e0f).\n\nI did a quick validation for myself comparing the values from the formula that you posted here, Djordje, and the measured values in the EPW file. \u00a0You can run this validation for yourself in the attached GH file and, from the image below you can see that both the formula from the\u00a0Maykut and Church model and the EPW values are relatively close:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\"

friend who runs the UWG and my general instinct that a physically measured value is probably more accurate than one derived from other measurements, I will replace the outdoor long wave functions in all of the comfort maps with these infrared values from the EPW. \u00a0I will also change the \"Solar Adjusted Temperature\" component to take this long wave radiation and an input instead of the relative humidity. \u00a0I will post back here once I do so, which should be relatively soon.\n\n\n\nI feel that another update of all of my example files is due but the error does not seem as large

all following the post, I have also posted a comparison between the thermal indices component MRT and the Solar Adjusted MRT:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\"

change introduced by using the recorded EPW downwelling radiation is relatively small and the biggest difference between the two components is still the shortwave radiation calculation, which is larger in the SolarCal model resulting in higher MRT values during the day.\n\n\n\nNow I only have to update the comfort maps and my components should be in a good place. \u00a0I'll post back here once it's done.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1543816", "name": "AddDownwellingRad.gh"}],

information, and the comparisons!!<br/><br/>Just for any future references and for the people who might be following this topic, a small clarification:<br/>The current **Thermal Comfort Indices** incoming long wave radiation uses \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m clear sky conditions emissivity coefficient, with Maykut and Church cloudiness factor so that it accounts for cloudy sky conditions. So basically this corrections creates the cloudy (all) skies emissivity coefficient.\n\n\n\n<br/>I was not aware of the fact that .epw files have been shipped with the **horizontalInfraredRadiation**. Thank you for posting this information!<br/><br/>I took a look at EnergyPlus [horizontalInfraredRadiation page](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/auxiliary-programs/energyplus-weather-file-epw-data-dictionary.html#field-horizontal-infrared-radiation-intensity).<br/>In there they state that: **\"If it is missing, it is calculated\"**.<br/><br/>I am pretty much certain that in Serbia, government weather stations do not record the long-wave radiation data.<br/>So I thought that this data is probably recorded in more developed countries, definitively in USA.<br/>I replicated the formula provided by mentioned bigladdersoftware.com\u00a0[page](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/auxiliary-programs/energyplus-weather-file-epw-data-dictionary.html#field-horizontal-infrared-radiation-intensity) in cases when \"Horizontal Infrared Radiation Intensity is missing\".<br/>This is the same Clark and Allen (1978) formula mentioned in upper attached **Survey of Sky Effective Temperature Models.pd**f, Table 3.<br/><br/>Once I checked the differences between the Clark and Allen formula and the **horizontalInfraredRadiation** from the epw file, they were not actually really close, but the same.<br/>I checked for a couple of locations in USA, but also outside of it, for different climates. The results were again the same:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zxy*xRp5iQ7Ypmwpr*QkgAwEOC1sKXO1gCptCfDhnFYnttq1IsVUt-waGSOFg-kENJLkiCFMgmrEq0lwR7NoegAhaUvgMjtO/calculatedLa_vs_measuredLa.jpg?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zxy*xRp5iQ7Ypmwpr*QkgAwEOC1sKXO1gCptCfDhnFYnttq1IsVUt-waGSOFg-kENJLkiCFMgmrEq0lwR7NoegAhaUvgMjtO/calculatedLa_vs_measuredLa.jpg)\n\nI attached the file below.<br/>I must admit that there are also hours when -1/+1 difference Wh/m2 exists, but my guess is that this is due to rounding of the values which is performed by EnergyPlus as shown in the example at [bigladdersoftware.com page](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/auxiliary-programs/energyplus-weather-file-epw-data-dictionary.html#field-horizontal-infrared-radiation-intensity) (0.036, 0.815, 340.6).\n\n<br/>So it's either the Clark and Allen formula is super precise and can predict the long wave radiation to be exactly the same as the physically measured value, or .epw weather files are in fact not using physically measured values but calculated ones.<br/>My assumption would be that it is the second case.\n\n\n\nIt seems that the only major difference between the two is that the Maykut and Church model seems to be overestimating the long wave radiation loss to the sky in very cold conditions.\u00a0 Otherwise the models show fairly good agreement\n\nBased on upper assumption, I do not think that we can distinguish whether either of these two incoming long-wave radiation methods is more precise or if the other one overestimates the **La** values.<br/><br/>Thank you too for the knowledge and the shared information!!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1544279", "name": "horizontalInfraredRadiation_Clark_Allen_1978.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "June 8, 2016 at 10:28am", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nOk. \u00a0The mircroclimate maps have been updated to use the EPW down-welling infrared radiation:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/f30f808278fbd24...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/f30f808278fbd24bbfb7a31b7b8cb08addf99aef)\n\nAt this point, the only thing that needs correcting is the example files, which I will do before the next release.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 8, 2016 at 10:39pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1520583"}
