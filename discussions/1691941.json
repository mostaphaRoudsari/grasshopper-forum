{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI need your help, again! :) i' am having an issue with re-colouring meshes.\n\nWhat i am trying to do is to:\n\n-\u00a0take and read\u00a0the DF results from a previous analysis (HB_**Lookup daylighting folder, HB_import points file, HB_read RAD results**\u00a0components)\n\n- assign a colour to each value depending on the european standards (i.e. if DF &lt; 2.2, \"Red\", \"Green\"...). (**Evaluate** component)\n\n- Re-colour the meshes according to the standards (**Mesh colours** component)\n\nHere is my workflow:\n\n<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2DcIUccSeJzpn11My3CdAEiMQP4AZqAo2AomqB1XJFmwLC8xXU-1NFVohOTQ3bBxtWXqd47gSTEJZDc2WTWwQBE/workflow.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>And here below are both the results: the one on the left is what\u00a0I am trying to plot, meanwhile on the right there are the results from the re-colour mesh DF analysis. As you can see\u00a0the ones\u00a0on the left\u00a0are \"correctly\" following the isocurves i have drawn (one for each european standad i wanted to see),\u00a0BUT the colours are not correct at all (look to the ones on the right).\n\nDo you have any advice? Do you know why it is doing this funny thing?\n\nPS: In my workflow i have tryed also to direct input the analysis mesh output into the **mesh coulours** component but it wasn't working.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2AANBQt1XEkgUpSAcbVJLhamr-VXeoYW1dbsMf5AtP0KfR7pOFiCzx3q*1MEU0GKcVeagIQ*0Mq8HVscVwPaICd/falseresults.PNG\" width=\"528\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2AANBQt1XEkgUpSAcbVJLhamr-VXeoYW1dbsMf5AtP0KfR7pOFiCzx3q*1MEU0GKcVeagIQ*0Mq8HVscVwPaICd/falseresults.PNG)\n\nAnyone can help me?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nClaudia\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "February 15, 2017 at 3:04am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Colour meshes according to European Standards - issue", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Claudia,\n\n\n\nThe difference between these maps is that the first one comes from some conditional statements - e.g. if the DF is greater than 2 set this color.. this function doesn't generate gradient colors, you have written a treshold function. While, the second map follows a gradient function, you have remapped values inside a domain of colors.\n\n\n\nSorry, I don't understand well what type of map do you want to reach (with gradient colors or treshold colors).<br/>Could you clarify this for me?\u00a0thanks.\n\n\n\nAntonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "February 15, 2017 at 4:44am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Antonello,\n\nThanks for your explaination.\n\nActually, I put the two images just to show the errors of the remapped one.\n\nTo be more clear, what i meant is to create a map with treshold colors like:\n\nfor the DF\u00a0below 0.7 --&gt; red\n\nfor the DF between\u00a00.7 -\u00a02.2 --&gt; orange\n\nfor the DF between\u00a02.2 -\u00a03.6 --&gt; yellow\n\nfor the DF between\u00a03.6 -\u00a05.4 --&gt; green\n\nfor the DF up to 5.4 --&gt; white\n\nSo in my mind the maps should have white colors next to the glazing system, then green, then yellow and so on. But as you can see from the one i have done, a part from the red colors, the others are not congruent with the real DF in the second image. \u00a0\n\nI would like just to know what is wrong in the workflow, if the functions or the meshes ...\n\nThanks\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "February 15, 2017 at 5:59am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Claudia,\n\n\n\nI'm not sure, because I can't check well your workflow.
