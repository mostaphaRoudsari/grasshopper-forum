I did notice you had a couple of legacy components still in your script. For example your 'Write EP result' is a 2014 component. This is the root of your problem.\n\n\n\nPerhaps pull the latest from Github and make sure the components are updating. If not then I would manually update the ones you need as the script is not that big so should not take too long.\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "August 2, 2016 at 5:31am", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Duncan,\n\n\n\nThank you for your reply, I hadn't realized i still had legacy components.\n\nI've changed that but now it says I have \"severe problems\"\n\nDo you managed to run fine?\u00a0\n\nDo I need to complete with more information (ie, schedules or so) for the simulation to run?\n\n\n\nobviously I must be doing something wrong...\n\n\n\nthanks again\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pablogomez", "created_at": "August 2, 2016 at 8:34am", "created_by": "Pablogomez", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nWhat are the severe problems?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "August 2, 2016 at 9:19am", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nthanks in advance, Duncan\n\n\n\nI attach one image with the problems\n\nThe severe problems are :\n\n**Severe** Problem in interior solar distribution Calculation (CHKBKS)\n\n**Severe** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 2 surfaces which are casting surfaces and are non-convex.\n\n\n\nApparently, what I see is that there's might be a problem with the adjancencies, but I just downloaded the file and try to update without modifying the geometry or the inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1575215", "name": "HoneyBee_severe problem.png"}], "created_by_name": "Pablogomez", "created_at": "August 2, 2016 at 10:21am", "created_by": "Pablogomez", "replies": []}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "August 2, 2016 at 1:17pm", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nPablo,\n\nThis sounds like a prime case of not having all of the components up-to-date as Duncan says. \u00a0You will likely have to manually update components if they are really old by re-dragging and dropping on the canvas.\n\nI would also recommend getting your example files from the [hydra platform](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/)\u00a0as the ones from the videos are reall old at this point.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 2, 2016 at 6:04pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you both Duncan and Chris for having the time to answer,\n\n\n\nYeap, I've updated manually all the components but still...\n\nI had previously worked with the examples of Hydra and the work really fine.
