{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI\u00a0would like to know if there is a way to maintain the same legend when i run a Microclimate map analysis.\n\nTo be more clear I would like to know if when I try to have a look step by step (let\u00b4s say in the morning, afternoon and evening)\u00a0to the results of the\u00a0analysis period, there is a way to have always the same legend. Because I have seen that it changes depending on the plotted values and not on\u00a0the values of the\u00a0entire analysis. I have tried to use Legend Par but I\u00a0still have the same problem.\u00a0\n\nSomeone have some suggestions?\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 30, 2016 at 4:24am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Legend - Visualize Microclimate Map", "replies": [{"body": "\nClaudia,\n\nLegendPar works for me. \u00a0See this example to make sure that you are suing it correctly:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Microclimate_Map_-_Simple&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1.0000000000000009&amp;offset=-53.717630518530314,-9.976129595107068)\n\n\n\nAlso, if you plot a degFromTargetMtx or a pmvMtx, the default legend will always be the same as you scroll through cases since this legend is set by human comfort from cold to hot as opposed to the specific connected data.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 30, 2016 at 6:25am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris!\n\nMy fault, you are right and with LegendPar you get the same legend. Thanks\u00a0a lot!!\n\nBut..another question:\u00a0how can I have a more visible difference\u00a0between one temperature to another?\n\nLet me explain: as you can see from the first image attached is really clear where the temperature is cold and where is warm. This was the results when i had the \"wrong\"\u00a0legend that was changing depending on the plotted values. Meanwhile, as you can see from the second image attached, the visual difference between temperatures is not so clear.\n\nI was trying to change the customColors, the gradIndex from the gradient component, the Buondaries, but is never so clear as in the previous \"wrong\" case..\n\nHave you got any suggestions? thanks a lot again!!\n\nThis Forum is ALWAYS so helpful!! :)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1557972", "name": "1.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1557973", "name": "2.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 30, 2016 at 7:35am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nWell, when you lock the legend to an annual spread, smaller differences in value simply will not be as pronounced anymore, because the legend scale does not adapt to the minimum and maximum values present in your data stream.\n\nSo you can't really have it both ways, I'm afraid.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nBest,\n\nMax\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Max D", "created_at": "July 3, 2016 at 8:54am", "created_by": "ButWhyprecisely", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Max,\n\nThanks a lot for your answer!
