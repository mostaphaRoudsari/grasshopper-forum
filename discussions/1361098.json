{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI would like to re-create with honeybee a double-skin model with specific characteristics.\n\nI have tried to follow some other discussion about this subject but I still have several issues to solve before I can run my code:\n\n\n\n- How can I add a window in a correct way? I would like to create a window with specific dimensions (not only glazing ratio) and assign specific properties (light trasmittance, solar gain, thermal trasmittance). Is it possible only if I model everything as surfaces?\n\n- I have tried to use a previously developed tool, but it still does not recognize the internal window...why?\n\n- How can I take into account of shadings? I would like to assign specific material properties\n\n- How can I assign boundary conditions (i.e. internal walls adiabatic)?\n\n- How can I model natural ventilation in the cavity between the two skins (a thermal zone)?\n\n\n\nMy goal is to calculate surface wall/window temperature of the analyzed zone and then check PMV/PPD parameters.\n\n\n\nLast question - how can I download all the gitHub improvements? Because of firewall setting I cannot update automatically.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\n\nRiccardo\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1361097", "name": "DSF_test_v1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Riccardo Diaferia", "created_at": "September 14, 2015 at 8:55am", "created_by": "RiccardoDiaferia49", "topic": "Double skin facade with shadings", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Riccardo\n\n\n\nCan you attach your Rhino file along with the GH file?

The interior window is there. You just haven't connected it to preview component.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3FLLVGZOVWK22lHVJRT2AwVYhbXoZpZ**2RReaahkT2qmvMcdrgVUrnSrJgRMBWge*jOkqvvj5Ke-3lRFwvZXjyjxY0Rr-E1/iw.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3FLLVGZOVWK22lHVJRT2AwVYhbXoZpZ**2RReaahkT2qmvMcdrgVUrnSrJgRMBWge*jOkqvvj5Ke-3lRFwvZXjyjxY0Rr-E1/iw.png)\n\n\n\n2. In energyplus shadings doesn't accept materials. You can use blinds instead. Take a look at\u00a0\"Honeybee_EnergyPlus Window Shade Generator\" component.\n\n\n\n3. SolveAdj component has the input to set BC for interior surfaces.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3FLLVGZOVWIcfkq6ON39SZbv2IAtYduS*sB39xZjcmIi9qkshfutij6PNQo-hiYsLa6NcIM*ZFFn1EM4pCqK5YMPRXbR1oLx/S.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3FLLVGZOVWIcfkq6ON39SZbv2IAtYduS*sB39xZjcmIi9qkshfutij6PNQo-hiYsLa6NcIM*ZFFn1EM4pCqK5YMPRXbR1oLx/S.png)\n\nIf you want to set them to adiabatic then you can use setToAdiabatic components.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3FLLVGZOVWK7wbhBuJ3o7KaAWuaN5SgnPglaHWQfarRNHU9WAg*025p3IXsHsisXwMy*q4Ari9hHOgwrKaJ7lK6Nx3h9RZ98/adiabatic.png\" width=\"495\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3FLLVGZOVWK7wbhBuJ3o7KaAWuaN5SgnPglaHWQfarRNHU9WAg*025p3IXsHsisXwMy*q4Ari9hHOgwrKaJ7lK6Nx3h9RZ98/adiabatic.png)\n\n4. For natural ventilation Chris has provided extensive answers\u00a0[including this one](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interzone-airflow-rate-for-a-large-volume?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1360388&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987).\n\n\n\nIf the component doesn't work then you need to download the files manually from github and replace the userObjects with the old ones. You have to do it separately for Ladybug and Honeybee which can be painful. Is there anyway to change the firewall settings?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3FLLVGZOVWJ0PRSjRj2Gl-scPlyX-QnoqCNncnBTL38YV9J7ZeE6HfmOxAraqd5XU7qdUqkDXf5NeQorkWjd-Jo3OO14Tag6/download.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3FLLVGZOVWJ0PRSjRj2Gl-scPlyX-QnoqCNncnBTL38YV9J7ZeE6HfmOxAraqd5XU7qdUqkDXf5NeQorkWjd-Jo3OO14Tag6/download.PNG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 22, 2015 at 7:37pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}]}
