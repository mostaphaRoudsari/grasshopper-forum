{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI've been trying to add glazing to my honeybee surfaces for an apartment building (L1) and about 25% of the windows don't show up after I've added them to the surface.\u00a0\n\nI've tried recreating the windows in Rhino many times by drawing a new surface over the top of the 'wall' surface and then changing the size of the new surface to be the size of the window, (to make sure that I have the window on the same plane as the wall) but with no luck.\u00a0\n\nAm I missing something simple here? Or am I just not getting the windows to get on the same planar surface as the walls? - If that is the case is there an easy way in Rhino to ensure that the window is on the same plane as the wall - \u00a0Its driving crazy!\n\nI've attached my Rhino and GH file (please excuse them, they are a bit of a messy work in progress)\n\nThanks\n\nChelle\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chelle Payne", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 10:10pm", "created_by": "ChellePayne", "topic": "Honeybee add glazing component", "replies": [{"body": "\nGH file attached\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1487963", "name": "Great North Rd Energy Model.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chelle Payne", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 10:18pm", "created_by": "ChellePayne", "replies": [{"body": "\nChelle,\n\nI believe this can be a problem of tolerance and being exact in the modeling.\n\nSee attached files.

I don't know what to do to get the glazing to add to the surfaces. Could someone please outline the steps that I should take in Rhino and Honeybee to add a window to a specific surface. Currently I have been (i) creating a planar surface and then (ii) extruding that surface to make a closed geometry/zone in Rhino and then (iii) drawing a new surface over the top of the particular surface that has a window in it and then (iv) changing the size of that new surface to match the size of the window in the building. I then (v) import the zone from (ii) into grasshopper and then (vi) decompose it into surfaces and then turn the window into a brep and add it to the surface using the add glazing component. This process seems to work for about 75% of the windows in the building, but I can't get the other 25% of windows to add onto the surface in grasshopper/honeybee. I am sure it is because the window and the surface are not planar, but I don't know how to check this or to make them planar in Rhino.

Instead the ones from yesterday. I didn't pay attention that your model is in millimeters, so i translated to meters. For energy simulations the model MUST be in meters since E+ works only in these units.\n\nAfter this opening, please open the attached. I took the liberty to define the zones differently from you (see white group). Much more compact. I've found a lot of issues with many of your individual surfaces so i redefined from new the whole zones. Some of the windows where indeed a bit rotated from orthogonal and a bit shifted from the home surface. But they were just a few. it was easy to fix. Also your tolerance was to low (0.00001, or so). Sometimes too low is not good.\n\nDidn't internalized the geometry yet, so you can see what i linked from the Rhino model.\n\n\n\nHope this helps and good luck.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1489802", "name": "GreatNorthRdEnergyModel_AY.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1489803", "name": "GNRHoneybeezones_AY_meterss.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 22, 2016 at 3:33am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI'm still not able to add glazing to a surface in Honeybee.
