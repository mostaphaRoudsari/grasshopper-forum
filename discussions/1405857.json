{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI have a question regarding metrics to measure glare potential, but for an external environment.\n\n\n\nI was looking at the Honeybee example file for Glare Analysis and also this page here:\n\n[http://web.mit.edu/tito_/www/Projects/Glare/GlareRecommendationsFor...](http://web.mit.edu/tito_/www/Projects/Glare/GlareRecommendationsForPractice.html)\n\n\n\nThe range of values in this page for imperceptible, perceptible, disturbing and intolerable glare make sense to me. My question is, however, are these ranges still applicable when you shift to an external environment? When the sun is out, the external environment is much brighter in comparison. And so I am getting DGP values closer to 0.7 or 0.8, which probably does not make sense because now everything is classified as glare. So, what metric would I use to figure out if, for example, a glass tower is actually creating glare for the people on the street? Should I be looking at the contrast among the luminance values in the scene? Or maybe just sunrays reflected directly by the building onto a specific spot?\n\n\n\nAny thoughts would be helpful.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nSaurabh\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saurabh Shrestha", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 5:55pm", "created_by": "SaurabhShrestha", "topic": "Glare for External Environment", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Saurabh,\n\nThere is no good answer for this. If you search in Radiance mailing list you should [find Jan's answer to a similar question on Radiance's mailing list](http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010847.html):\n\n\"Be aware, that DGP is just a measure for discomfort\u00a0glare\u00a0INSIDE a building. It does not include disability\u00a0glare\u00a0and is also no measure for discomfort\u00a0glare\u00a0OUTSIDE\u00a0a building, where you have much higher adaptation levels.\"\n\n\n\nI would say a ray-tracing analysis can give you a good idea of potential issues but then how to calculate DGP values based on an image analysis is something that I can't really comment on.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 6:11pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks, Mostapha!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saurabh Shrestha", "created_at": "November 23, 2015 at 9:56am", "created_by": "SaurabhShrestha", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHi Saurabh,\n\nHave a look at [this paper](http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2013/p_1232.pdf)\u00a0It might be of some interest for you\n\n\n\nBest,\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "amedeo scofone", "created_at": "November 24, 2015 at 5:20am", "created_by": "amedeoscofone", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you for the link.
