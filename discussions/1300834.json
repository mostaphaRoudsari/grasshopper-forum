{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI in the simulation that I was working on I needed to associated specific glazing ratio to each input surface. The current component assign the ratio based on surface orientation.\n\nI modified the Honeybee_glazing based on ratios component. It worked for my simulation, but I did not test it enough to be sure it is bug-free. You can access and review the python script to check or modify the changes. I just thought I share it in case others are trying to do similar thing.\n\nThanks.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-7-17Ut3vwqQ6K7y12wy3PXYp1FilvuVf40v0RWuuQLLdwfBDDNKZQFL*tq3ZRAb1g7SLlJV1FydE7bUf5GMHnrc2QXnqykg/HB_CustomGlazingRatio.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-7-17Ut3vwqQ6K7y12wy3PXYp1FilvuVf40v0RWuuQLLdwfBDDNKZQFL*tq3ZRAb1g7SLlJV1FydE7bUf5GMHnrc2QXnqykg/HB_CustomGlazingRatio.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1300833", "name": "NewHBPercentageGlazingComponent.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Rajaa Issa", "created_at": "June 1, 2015 at 10:50am", "created_by": "RajaaIssa", "topic": "Glazing Ratio per surface (not surface orientation)", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Rajaa,\n\nThank you for the feedback. I haven't tested it but I'm almost pretty sure that in this case you could also graft glazing ratios to match HBSurfaces, then the percentage will be applied to the surface regardless of orientation.\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 12, 2015 at 3:40pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}
