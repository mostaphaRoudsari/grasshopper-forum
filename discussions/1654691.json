Therefore, only direct normal radiation should match, as you pointed out.\n\n\n\nglobalHorizontalRadiation and diffuseHorizontalRadiation are radiation on a horizontal surface, so they will differ. Attached image should give you a clue. You can test this using Ladybug.\n\n\n\nTake the\u00a0total of globalHorizontalRadiation. From that deduct the total of diffuseHorizontalRadiation. That number will be less than the total of directNormalRadiation.\n\n\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1655049", "name": "Cosine Angle.png"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "December 9, 2016 at 12:08pm", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\n\n\nno worries for the name spelling:)\n\n\n\nNow it became clear to me.
