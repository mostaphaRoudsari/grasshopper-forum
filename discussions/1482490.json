In this case, we may need two\u00a0Occupancy Schedules and two corresponding\u00a0Occupancy Activity Schedules\u00a0for the players and\u00a0spectators respectively.\n\nTherefore, it is important to allow us to connect multiple\u00a0customized Occupancy Schedules and\u00a0multiple\u00a0Occupancy Activity Schedules\u00a0to the \"setEPZoneSchedules\" component at the same time; and it is also important for us to input data as a \"list\"\u00a0into the \"setEPZoneLoads\"\u00a0component, each value (i.e. load) in the input \"list\" corresponds to a different customized Schedule.\n\n**Is it possible to do that in HB? and what is the correct way?**\n\nThank you!\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "March 12, 2016 at 7:00am", "created_by": "doudou", "replies": []}], "id": "1482490"}
