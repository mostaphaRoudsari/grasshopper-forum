{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nI have a small problem when I was using the Microclimate map example file. Following the guidance, I copied the zip file URL to my clipboard and connected to the 'weatherFileURL'. But with an error pop-out: WeatherFileURL is not a valid web address to a DOE weather file.\n\n\n\nIs this because the DOE's website changed?\u00a0\n\n[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_about...](http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_about.cfm)\n\n[https://www.energyplus.net/weather](https://www.energyplus.net/weather)\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!!\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Maria X", "created_at": "January 6, 2016 at 11:17pm", "created_by": "MariaX", "topic": "Problem with loading WeatherFileURL", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Maria,\n\nYou are right.

The remaining problem is that when I was trying to run the Microclimate Map, there is a component named \u2018Ladybug_Import_Stat\u2019 which requires me to feed in \u2018Statfile\u2019. I have checked all the related \u2018import weather file\u2019 component, but cannot find a specific component to open StatFile.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/088*6UBF7TCl2TQhMA08ekHRYUbsbCX*8LObwOYAWewsrm2fXZSUP*v8KtUtevaZC68bloWGj3157mcaS14OHwDGr9V80oZW/1.png?width=200\" width=\"200\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/088*6UBF7TCl2TQhMA08ekHRYUbsbCX*8LObwOYAWewsrm2fXZSUP*v8KtUtevaZC68bloWGj3157mcaS14OHwDGr9V80oZW/1.png)\n\nI tried to link \u2018Open EPW\u2019 component to \u2018Ladybug_Import_Stat\u2019 , but it seems didn\u2019t work (see as below).
