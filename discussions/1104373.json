I manage to have proper HBZones with RADMaterials and EPConstructions (I've run Daylight calculation on them successfully), but when I plug the zones to GrizzlyBear this error appears:\n\n**Solution exception:'EPZone' object has no attribute 'getCurrentLoads'**\n\n\n\nIn addition, something similar happens when I plug these HBZones to the newest decomposeByType component, althought it works properly when plugged to the previous version of it. This is what the error says:\n\n**Solution exception:'hb_EPZoneSurface' object has no attribute 'BC'**\n\n\n\nSame thing with SetEPZoneConstruction:\n\n**Solution exception:'hb_EPZoneSurface' object has no attribute 'BCObject'**\n\n\n\nAny thought?\n\nAnder\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1104372", "name": "gbXML trial 03.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ander Gortazar Balerdi", "created_at": "July 21, 2014 at 9:10am", "created_by": "AnderGortazarBalerdi", "topic": "problems with HBZone and AddGlazing component - GrizzlyBear", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ander,\n\nI can't check your file right now but this is probably happening because you are using some components with a newer version than Honeybee_Honeybee in your file.
