{"body": "\nHello everybody,\n\n\n\ni have imported an IDF file in honeybee for some test.\n\nIt seems that all the components work well, but when I re-run the energy simulation I obtained several errors.\n\nFor example:\n\n**Failed to write F2825E_glzP_0 to idf file**<br/>**8. index out of range: 0**<br/>**9. Failed to write 29BFFB_glzP_0 to idf file**<br/>**10. index out of range: 0**<br/>**11. Failed to write 613DE8_glzP_0 to idf file**<br/>**12. index out of range: 0**<br/>**13. Failed to write 3CBCE5 to idf file**<br/>**14. index out of range: 0**<br/>**15. Failed to write BDEF6C to idf file**<br/>**16. index out of range: 0**\n\n**Etc...**\n\nSomeone knows how to solve this problem.\n\nIn attached you can find idf file, gh definition and the errors list.\n\n\n\nThanks for availability.\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nAndrea\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1525607", "name": "modulo-sh-control2.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1525608", "name": "testimport.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1525609", "name": "errors.txt"}], "created_by_name": "Andrea Zani", "created_at": "May 8, 2016 at 8:24am", "created_by": "AndreaZani905", "topic": "Problem with imported IDF", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Andrea,\n\nIt was an issue with empty shading controls.
