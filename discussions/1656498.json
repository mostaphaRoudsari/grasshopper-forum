{"body": "\nI've got the top four floors of a building that i'm working on set up in HB. If I run only one floor through OpenStudio, it runs fine. Same thing with three floors. Not a problem. Each floor is more or less a copy of the other so the codes aren't really changing from one the other.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs soon as I hook up a fourth floor though, rhino crashes when I toggle OpenStudio. In each case solveadjacencies works so I feel like I'm missing something. I partially suspect it is my computer/ram getting maxed out but that doesn't seem all too realistic. I feel like it would take more for 32gbs to get maxed out.\u00a0\n\nThanks,\u00a0\n\nZack\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1656497", "name": "Upload To HB Grasshopper File.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Zack", "created_at": "December 12, 2016 at 5:06pm", "created_by": "ZackSickman", "topic": "Can anyone help me understand why my model is crashing?", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Zach,\n\nI checked this file.
