I think adding the items that you mentioned are pretty useful. Not everybody in the world can really read the chart so I see it as a helpful feature to educate users.\n\n\n\nI also want to add that I emailed Climate Consultant team about their logic behind the polygons and they had their own reasons not to share it. That could be helpful next to their help file.
