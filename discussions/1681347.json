{"body": "\nHello,\n\nAnyone have an idea of how to add four tinting state for electrochromic glass or add three shading set points using the following node? I am trying to do a thermal comfort simulation for EC glass in grasshopper, but I was unable to add all the tinting states of the glass and apply a specific schedule to the glass. (I have also include the glass specification image below) Anyone have an idea of how to solve this problem? Attached is the script that I am working on. Any comments or advice would be appreciated.\u00a0[<br/> <img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4gUc0nun9aY4suKrKqWqszFsRQ6UYK9cauBpPnSNDRfZGe1RLY8L9EmxAjhLeNTT0wenja7tCh2CLFF*DC5rIUzIxtCnhVmw/Q1.jpg\" width=\"743\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4gUc0nun9aY4suKrKqWqszFsRQ6UYK9cauBpPnSNDRfZGe1RLY8L9EmxAjhLeNTT0wenja7tCh2CLFF*DC5rIUzIxtCnhVmw/Q1.jpg)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4gUc0nun9aYQotuWgAmpyWzVhs9U9gqixEFM3U8XpK6DO*wd0JOSq6xJQVhgWDHqCy4Apdh4jIDit6Y9x0cobK8RyF9zJVWZ/Q2.png\" width=\"633\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4gUc0nun9aYQotuWgAmpyWzVhs9U9gqixEFM3U8XpK6DO*wd0JOSq6xJQVhgWDHqCy4Apdh4jIDit6Y9x0cobK8RyF9zJVWZ/Q2.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1681345", "name": "Geometry.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1681346", "name": "EC thermal.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Agnes", "created_at": "January 31, 2017 at 12:53am", "created_by": "Agnes", "topic": "how to add four tinting state or add three shading set point for electrochromic glass?", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 1, 2017 at 6:30am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\nThank you so much for your reply. What you said are quite useful since this question has been bothering me for a long time. I do need to model 4-state controls. I have tried many other software as well (like COMFEN,\u00a0Designbuilder, and CBE Thermal Comfort Model), but none of these software work. I really hope it could work in grasshopper. Could you please be more specific about the program that can edit the simulation as E+ is running? It would be great if you can find a link. I would love to have a try.\u00a0\n\nThank you again!\n\nYihong\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Agnes", "created_at": "February 1, 2017 at 10:39am", "created_by": "Agnes", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nYihong,\n\nThe only platform that comes to mind that allows you dynamic editing of the energy simulation while it's running is [MLE+](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mbehl/mleplus.html). \u00a0The learning curve is very steep, though and I would not recommend it unless you already have a background in coding and understand the IDF file format (also, Matlab is very expensive). \u00a0What control strategy are you using that requires you to account for all 4 states? \u00a0Also, what results are you trying to obtain? \u00a0Energy use?
