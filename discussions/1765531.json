I think if you put these settings to Window, calculating your U/SC values will create the BSDF reports which you can then export. You can then use the Honeybee_Radiance BSDF material component to import it in your definition.\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1769790", "name": "BSDF_window.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "June 15, 2017 at 9:20pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Theodoros,<br/>\n\nI really appreciate your reply but unfortunately i do not know how can i get the menu in the image you had uploaded.<br/>If you kindly tell me how to get this menu as i export idf report from the menu in the image i had uploaded.\u00a0<br/>Thank you\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1769934", "name": "Capture.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Ahmed Toutou", "created_at": "June 16, 2017 at 7:53am", "created_by": "AhmedToutou", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1765531"}
