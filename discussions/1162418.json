You can then put the images of the colored meshes behind your lines in the pdf.\n\nMy preferred method for quickly putting together a pdf is just taking a lot of screenshots/pictures with the windows snipping tool and pasting them into an illustrator file.\n\nI hope that helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 5, 2014 at 10:40am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nAs an alternative once I modified a script that I found in the forum to export SVG files and you could then import them into Illustrator with no issues.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 5, 2014 at 11:20pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nI also just remembered that Rhino has a direct export to PDF. \u00a0I am not so sure that it will give you the results that you want but it is an option.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 6, 2014 at 12:45am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nThanks for the tips and quick respons!\n\nSome updates: I have tried the Rhino pdf maker and it exports the lines without the colours, as Chris Mackey mentions.\n\n\n\nSo far the only way I found to get the coloured results as a pdf was with this sricpt:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/vector-output-to-pdf-or-ai](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/vector-output-to-pdf-or-ai)\n\n\n\nI upload my def. hope it helps :)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1163671", "name": "Color hatch & Ladybugg honeybee TEST.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Gonzalez Damonte", "created_at": "November 7, 2014 at 2:26am", "created_by": "GermanGonzalezDamonte", "replies": []}]}
