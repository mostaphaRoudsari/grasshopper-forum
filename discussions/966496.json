[Download GHPython](https://github.com/mcneel/ghpython/releases/download/v0.6.0.3/GhPython.gha)\u00a0and install it and it should work fine.\n\n\n\n**2. You still see the image above in case 1 however you have GHPython already installed. What about that?**\n\n\n\nIn this case probably the GHA component is blocked. Find GHPython.GHA on your system (usually at: C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Grasshopper\\Libraries) . Right click, go to properties and select unblock.\n\nTo make sure that GHPython is working fine on your system open the attachment file (testGHPython.gh). You should see something similar to the image below on your screen when you open the file:\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hSOUK3FODos9DCqirQC7dqbrG3pOwbtihRMxM1K9GMFYXX9LiilsLeUAk8gL4p-EdOncSpWNzuO8TlU06GVMeKEMkDBE5G51/testGHPython.png?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hSOUK3FODos9DCqirQC7dqbrG3pOwbtihRMxM1K9GMFYXX9LiilsLeUAk8gL4p-EdOncSpWNzuO8TlU06GVMeKEMkDBE5G51/testGHPython.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see the something similar you should be fine to go!
