{"body": "\nHi!<br/><br/>When i input the surface attached in the example into the context shading component\u00a0it splits the surface into two. This creates problems for me further down the pipeline.<br/><br/>Why does it do it? (starting surface is checked to be planar)<br/><br/>If i merge the surfaces after the context shading component has done its work, will they continue to behave as they should in e+ and hb generator?<br/><br/><br/>\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1405353", "name": "context geometry question.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 7:58am", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "topic": "Honeybe E+ context shading component splitting surfaces", "replies": [{"body": "\nUpdate; two merged HB surface does not work like a single surface in HB components.

EPContext component meshes all the surfaces regardless of being planar since I wanted to avoid any possible issues with EnergyPlus but now I can see how it can cause some real issues. \u00a0For example I'm not sure if EnergyPlus can handle shading non-convex shading surfaces. Let me give it a try and see if I can create a cleaner version without re-writing the whole component.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 5:51pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHere you go:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bSwfCDfF4Fa9yun-ai1tAq8UV9w4iTXC8z7K*UQkxMIwMxOoctlMfLSMNmVvvnCkmy3HX-gSSWD4znABPBvdiThrBI4h3VUs/contextGeometry.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bSwfCDfF4Fa9yun-ai1tAq8UV9w4iTXC8z7K*UQkxMIwMxOoctlMfLSMNmVvvnCkmy3HX-gSSWD4znABPBvdiThrBI4h3VUs/contextGeometry.png)\n\nHaven't tested it for enough cases so make sure to double check the outputs.
