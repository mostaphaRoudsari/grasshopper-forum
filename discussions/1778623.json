{"body": "\nHello all<br/>I am working on an architectural project.<br/>Briefly it requires satellite imagery as a base and the volume is generated according to certain parameters.<br/><br/>I am trying to find an optimum form using ladybug radiation analysis and galapagos. The analysis process is becoming extremely slow as i start playing with the geometry.\n\nI have a high config workstation and also have tried galapagos with different simple forms. Not able to figure out if it is the problem of this particular file(Geometry) or because of the satellite imagery or any other reason.<br/><br/>Can anyone help me speeding up this process.Suggestion on any other way of subdividing the geometry is appreciated.<br/><br/>Thankyou.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1778621", "name": "Building volume.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1778622", "name": "Geospatial analysis.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Pramodk", "created_at": "July 5, 2017 at 1:16am", "created_by": "Pramodk", "topic": "Help me to speed up Ladybug Analysis and Galapagos form finding", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Pramodk,\n\n1. Is this slow when you run it once too or is it happening after running a number of simulations?\n\n2. What is the number of test points? Can you reduce them?\n\n3. Is this only Ladybug or Grasshopper is slow in general? Do you have a lot of data internalized / loaded in GH? That can slow down Grasshopper as well.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 6, 2017 at 8:54am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Pramodk,\n\nCheck the duplicated geometries, you have lots of overlapped geometries after random component..!\n\nIn Radiation analysis\u00a0component You can set true the Parallel Cpu.\u00a0\n\n-Omid\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Omid Rashidi", "created_at": "July 7, 2017 at 3:38am", "created_by": "OmidmRashidi", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks for the reply. I have changed the subdivision method to a simpler one. But the problem is the subsurface geometry is exceeding out of the original brep. How do i limit it to within the brep?
