{"body": "\nI am trying to model electrochromic shading for a skylight. I am using the EPWindowShades component but it only had a minimal impact on the energy results.\n\nThen I looked at the output .csv files of the simulation, and it looks like there is no shade control on the skylight objects. So I guess the component only works for windows, and not skylights. Is there a way to apply the shade control to the skylights as well?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2BW*6Bq22gTBRGSeY7vO8lLKCWgTBLETVi85HupazwwXXjeL75kzH0tooRAms0FjRpa-Tp5l*h8nowCGz77VX8M/Skylight.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2BW*6Bq22gTBRGSeY7vO8lLKCWgTBLETVi85HupazwwXXjeL75kzH0tooRAms0FjRpa-Tp5l*h8nowCGz77VX8M/Skylight.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elliot Glassman", "created_at": "February 15, 2017 at 4:09pm", "created_by": "ElliotGlassman", "topic": "Skylight Shade Contol", "replies": [{"body": "\nI changed the component to reference the skylight as a surface (rather than trying to assign the entire zone to the HBObject input.
