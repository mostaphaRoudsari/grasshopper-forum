{"body": "\nHi all!\n\nI would like to ask you some question regarding the SunPath simulation through LadyBug.\n\nIs it possible to run this kind of simulation referring only to one particular facade?\n\nBecause i have tryed to do that using the\u00a0LadyBug_SunPath component and giving\u00a0the center of\u00a0my facade as the centerPt input, but i still receive results when the sun is, let\u00b4s say, on the back of the facade..It seems as\u00a0the component doesn\u00b4t consider the normal of the facade.\u00a0\n\nI attached the image to show you better what i mean.[<img class=\"align-left\" height=\"556\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DLsMNj26FUXPZJjtKSanPj*muvdzjDKCj-jlS5WJ5XjTN-UxlXug0TnCqY1E1pJWbrpn6PpSn6ti9*eY0DQqLFO3NqXTImAX/1.PNG?width=750\" style=\"width: 383px; height: 258px;\" width=\"750\"/><br/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DLsMNj26FUXPZJjtKSanPj*muvdzjDKCj-jlS5WJ5XjTN-UxlXug0TnCqY1E1pJWbrpn6PpSn6ti9*eY0DQqLFO3NqXTImAX/1.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to have the result of the\u00a0sunpath (Azimut, Altitudes...)\u00a0just referring to one precise facade?\u00a0\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "July 26, 2016 at 6:42am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "SunPath results", "replies": [{"body": "\nThe sunpath alone will not do that for you.\n\nYou want to cull all vectors that are not hitting the facade.
