I did not notice the new release of the components. I have updated them and it works now.\n\n\n\nIn addition, considering that the function of \"daylight control\" or \"daylight threshold\" for energy simulation is not available so far ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-daylight...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-daylight-setpoint-bug)), I have to\u00a0set up the energy simulation based on an annual daylight simulation. Hereby, I have some questions as follows.\n\n\n\n-\u00a0**As for the lighting schedule (in csv format) generated from the \"annual Profiles\" in the\u00a0\"read Annual Results I\" component in daylight simulation, how can I link it (instead of the default lighting\u00a0schedule) to the\u00a0succedent energy simulation? Could you please show this in my GH files?**\n\nI could imagine how to make \"customized\" EP constructions and EP loads and link them to the simulation. But, as for EP schedules, I can not figure out how the energy simulation can receive and recognize a\u00a0\"customized\"\u00a0EP schedule (i.e. from csv files). I am asking this because the light schedule generated by daylight simulation is in csv format, and also because\u00a0the schedules provided by Honeybee are limited to some specific building type (i.e. office, retail etc.). But the schedules of some other type of buildings are not included, like\u00a0the schedules of\u00a0sports buildings.\n\n\n\n**- In the attached csv file (which is generated\u00a0<strong>from the \"annual Profiles\"**\u00a0in the\u00a0\"read Annual Results I\" component in daylight simulation), why the **electric\u00a0**lighting is still partially \"on\" even when the \"occupancy\" shows \"0 (absent)\"?</strong>\n\nFor instance, \"Row 16, 64....\" in the csv file. As I understand, the\u00a0electric\u00a0lighting is\u00a0partially/fully \"on\" only when the both of the following conditions are met, namely, there are people in the space and the illuminance level from daylight is below the threshold. Am I right?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**- Is****\u00a0the above mentioned procedure\u00a0a proper way to calculate the energy use for\u00a0electric lighting when there is a lighting\u00a0dimming system (the\u00a0<strong>electric\u00a0**lighting may be continuously adjusted in proportion to the amount of daylight available)?\u00a0</strong>\n\nApart from the above mentioned way of calculating the energy use for\u00a0electric lighting, I also made other two ways for comparison showed\u00a0in the attached image. But, the outcomes are very different. Which do you think is the most proper way to\u00a0calculate the energy use for\u00a0electric lighting when there is a lighting\u00a0dimming system?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1277592", "name": "unnamed_0_space_0_intgain.xlsx"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1277593", "name": "3 ways to calculate energy use for electric lighting.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1277594", "name": "text6.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 1:28pm", "created_by": "doudou", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ding,\n\nGlad that everything's good with the ReadEPResult component. \u00a0I removed totalEnergy since it was not really correct to draw an equivalence between the thermal (heating/cooling) energy and the electric (light and equipment) energy.\n\nTo use you annual daylight result in an E+ simulation, all that you have to do is connect the annualProfiles csv file path to the lighting schedule of the \"Set EnergyPlus Zone Schedules\" component. \u00a0This will assume that you have auto-dimming lights in your zone and so this procedure is correct so long as this is what your final building will have. \u00a0I can't tell what your three methods are in the image but, if you sum up the electric lighting results of the E+ simulation, this will give you a correct indication of your electric lighting energy use. \u00a0You can find more on how to create and assign your own csv schedules in these two videos:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MRK_RxvD3o&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MRK_RxvD3o&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=21)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ZQ5sazwrU&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ZQ5sazwrU&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=22)\n\nAs for the occupancy/lighting situation, usually you are not supposed to have the lights on when occupancy is 0 but I think that daysim is interpreting that particular hour you point out in the excel file as a lunch hour where the occupants would conceivably leave the lights on. \u00a0If you want to be more precise, I think that the \"Daysim Occupancy Generator Based on List\" would give you better results.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 1:49pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you so much for the very helpful tutorial and your explanation!\u00a0But, I have still one more question just to make sure I understand right regarding the \"total energy\".\u00a0\n\n\n\nConsidering that the \"totalEnergy\" has been removed from the \"read EP result\" component, but what shall we do\u00a0if we still want to obtain the simulation result of\u00a0the \"total energy\" ? -\u00a0Is that true that the\u00a0sum of\u00a0the thermal (heating/cooling) energy and the electric (light and equipment) energy obtained from the\u00a0\"read EP result\" component is equal to\u00a0the \"total energy\" used by the zone?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition,\u00a0is it expected\u00a0to integrate the \"daylight threshold\" function to the EP simulation again\u00a0in near future\u00a0?
