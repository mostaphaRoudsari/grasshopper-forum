{"body": "\nHi and thank you for a great software!<br/><br/>How do i create a wind rose excluding conditions when dry bulb temp is above a specific temp? I presume i have to manipulate incomming data as the Wind rose panels own conditions dont allow this condition.\n\n\n\nAnd, how do i create a wind rose that only shows wind direction during my heating degree hours?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "November 5, 2014 at 6:14am", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "topic": "Creating a wind rose based on conditional dry bulb temp.", "replies": [{"body": "\nLudvig,\n\nYou should look for the LB examples.

This was very helpful. your video helped me understand why i kept getting the conditional statements wrong.<br/><br/>I do have a small follow up question out of curiosity though.<br/><br/>If i would want to calculate what wind directions that lead to the most heatloss i would have to calculate a wind chill effect neglecting the RH. Temperature, air specific heat, wind speed and heating degree hours all in one equation. Is this doable? Is it relevant? It would lead to a windrose that is very graphic and easy to understand i think.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "November 7, 2014 at 7:38am", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "November 7, 2014 at 8:24am", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "replies": [{"body": "\nLudvig,\n\nYou could set up a Honeybee Energy simulation and plug in the \"infiltrationLossGain\" to the annual hourly data of the wind rose. \u00a0That infiltration loss/gain will show you the hourly heat gained or lost to the zone by infiltration, which seems to be what you are interested in. \u00a0You could then use the conditional statement to select the hours when this infiltration loss is the worst. \u00a0That's the best way that I would think of it.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 7, 2014 at 10:31am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "November 7, 2014 at 10:36am", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "replies": []}]}
