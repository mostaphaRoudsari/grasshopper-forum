{"body": "\nHi all.\n\nI just want to know if it is possible to run parametric energy simulation as parametric daylight analysis in tutorials? since i work on multi-objective optimization, i think it's better first run all possible solutions and then use them for optimization. any idea in this case can be so helpful.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mahr", "created_at": "December 8, 2015 at 1:47pm", "created_by": "mahr", "topic": "possibility of parametric energy simulation!", "replies": [{"body": "\nThere is nothing to stop you from that. The set-up is very similar and you only need to run an energy simulation for each option instead of daylighting.

What a shame it's simply amazing. Will play around with it asap.\n\n\n\nI'm using pollination with a lot of success lately to test a series of parametric study definitions. While I do realize that the instructions on the wiki seem straightforward, would there be a chance for a sample file for DE?\n\n\n\nAs a side note, not sure if it's worthy of a separate discussion, but I did run into some trouble with parametric daylighting (DF in particular). It seems to be very slow restarting the simulation and taking up a lot of memory. I'm fairly certain it has to do with my definition, as most of the HB objects are \"re-made\" in the pipeline at each iteration. Has anyone ever had memory trouble with parametric daylighting?\n\n\n\nAlso, I'm curious. Would rotating a simple brep before making zones out of it be better, computationally-wise, than rotating HB objects?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance and thanks for the amazing job!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 6:13am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Theodore,\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor a sample .csv you can \u00a0click on the \"save selection to file\" button as seen on the screenshot of Mostapha above and in the DE page.
