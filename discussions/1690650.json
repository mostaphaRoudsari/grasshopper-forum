{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am fairly new to both ladybug and honeybee. I have been trying to study the solar radiations falling on my geometry. I tried using the component radiation analysis in ladybug and could run it successfully and have some results. In order to get more accurate results I was suggested to move to honeybee which I have been trying to do but to begin with I made a test for a small rectangular geometry and tried to get results from both using ladybug and then using honeybee with grid based analysis.\n\n\n\nThe results I got were off by 3866 Wh. Could somebody explain to me why?\n\n\n\nI am attaching some files below if someone can have a look and help me understand what is the matter would be appreciated.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAll this pursuit for me to get to include the reflection from the ground as well!! How can I do that using this simple geometry as an example.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nAnurag\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1690648", "name": "test honeybee.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1690649", "name": "test honeybee.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Anurag Verma", "created_at": "February 13, 2017 at 7:47am", "created_by": "AnuragVerma", "topic": "Ladybug vs Honeybee", "replies": [{"body": "\nIf you want to do comparative studies you should use the same sky type.
