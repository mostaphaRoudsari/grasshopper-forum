Even when I put another configuration\u00a0 in the input component, the value in the IDF file is the same. Is the anything I could do to fix the situation?\n\n\n\nThank you..\n\n\n\nAgus\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/oszb1oYwZCkFVN4uMN4g0sLjBrTfHI0Q699p1EL7KtpYJC48KWBE1B-UXRyZH8J6UgJNav7evPIV0X8mYP-ljHibB4VnSYlZ/simControl1.PNG\" width=\"490\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/oszb1oYwZCkFVN4uMN4g0sLjBrTfHI0Q699p1EL7KtpYJC48KWBE1B-UXRyZH8J6UgJNav7evPIV0X8mYP-ljHibB4VnSYlZ/simControl1.PNG)[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/oszb1oYwZCn2GFhrujjDEuCcN4LCv6e1pK4EXgZISNhOJjOvXrV7ZNqvI6EkRqOfY8gs8hW3b6ge0Ec27-KeVrxfFYJ8tRj0/simControl.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/oszb1oYwZCn2GFhrujjDEuCcN4LCv6e1pK4EXgZISNhOJjOvXrV7ZNqvI6EkRqOfY8gs8hW3b6ge0Ec27-KeVrxfFYJ8tRj0/simControl.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Agus Hariyadi", "created_at": "June 18, 2014 at 11:56am", "created_by": "kirpytus", "topic": "Simulation Control doesn't match beetwen IDF and input component", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Agus, Thank you for reporting this.
