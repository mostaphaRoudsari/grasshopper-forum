{"body": "\nHi all!\n\nI wonder if there's any possibility in getting hourly radiation results from a daylight simulation with cumulative sky (W-output).\n\nThe only possibility, for now, is to step by step anaylizing 8760 hours/year and combining the results then. But there's no need to explain the effort.\n\nHow can I get out hourly data from this simulation result?\n\n\n\nThank you very much in advance,\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1319758", "name": "GETTING HOURLY RADIATION DATA OF EACH LEVEL.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "July 3, 2015 at 5:48am", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "topic": "LOOKUP DAYLIGHT FOLDER - GETTING HOURLY RADIATION FILES", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Daniel, You can use Daysim for that and get the hourly radiation values for each hour of the year similar to annual daylight simulation.

That's great.

By changing the analysis-surface with my slider it gives me the \"1. Solution exception:'NoneType' object is unsubscriptable\"-warning (component from FEB_01_2015) or the \"1. Solution exception:name 'exportAirWalls_' is not defined\"-warning (component from FUL_13_2015). Any idea in how to solve the problem. The aim is to make the daylight-simulation with animated sliders.\n\nIn addition, after updating the components I have to reinsert the childsurface-component (1.
