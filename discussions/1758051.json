{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, and everyone!\n\n\u00a0\n\nI simulated some days and hours using ladybug e honeybee and I set S\u00e3o Paulo epw.\n\nSo, the december is the summer and june winter.\u00a0**The corectly result would be december, march, september, june**.\n\nI did two kind of simulation. The first one - just one hour 10h and then 15:30. The second, 10:00 to 15:30h. I think that's something wrong with the results kWh/m\u00b2 because the biggest values for radiation, are for winter. And the results simulation 10:00 to 15:30h the result are different too, the biggest values for winter (june), then september, march, and them december (summer)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe results are (kWh/m\u00b2)\n\n10:00h \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 15:30h \u00a0 \u00a0 10 to15:30h\n\n**21/03**\u00a00,69 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01,15 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02,61\n\n**21/06**\u00a01,14 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01,13 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03,71\n\n**23/09**\u00a00,96 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00,90 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02,79\n\n**21/12**\u00a01,31 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01,22 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02,45\n\n\u00a0\n\nI will be very gratiful with your answer I'm using this software to a important academic work, and in my Country Its not commom use this software, I don't know anyone that could help me with this.

The TMY (Typical Meteorological Year) format used for most weather data files was developed by Sandia national library. The method is based on 12 years of measured data. Starting with January, January which is closest to the mean of twelve Januaries is selected based on a composite weighing of solar radiation, temperature, humidity and wind velocity. The same process is applied for the following months. So as a result, each TMY month most likely correspond to measured data from a different year. That is how the weather data file is composed.

That is just not enough data for one to draw any conclusions. Because as per your argument, it is impossible for any five hours in June to be warmer than any five hours in December. Direct-Normal radiation is purely a function of the amount radiation received directly from the sun. So, if the five hours in December 21 in your calculation were cloudy, the amount of direct-radiation for those hours will be zero. Secondly, your statement that.. \"The temperature is ok, but radiance shuold be like temperature..\" is not correct. It can be that you feel warmer on a cloudy day than you do on a sunny day.\n\n\n\nThe monthly weather data for Sao Paulo indicates that most of the rainfall occurs in the months of January and December. This implies that the direct-normal radiation for those months will be low, but the global-horizontal radiation will be high. And this is consistent with the results you are getting.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/JPX5gKnxX7I6a9OPp5C1Yds7u-uRexx7IRSomPzhSjlJruOXB-LoKySBbXf6zGxegoxjUiRfAhuHgmW9sBK4eWcLkwVHlXS8/Selection_234.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/JPX5gKnxX7I6a9OPp5C1Yds7u-uRexx7IRSomPzhSjlJruOXB-LoKySBbXf6zGxegoxjUiRfAhuHgmW9sBK4eWcLkwVHlXS8/Selection_234.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry comparing more number of hours in Winter versus Summer. Something like (10AM to 3PM)* ( June 1 - June 30) versus (10AM to 3PM)*(December 1 - December 30). Finally, for the climate in Sao Paulo, it makes sense to compare direct-normal and global horizontal radiations separately.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 28, 2017 at 3:57pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}]}]}
