Doing this you basically help the component not to fail with offset curve on surface which is how it finds the right percentage of glazing.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/MOC7BqAcxPvE7XrRKrtrd5WfcuLxnBf5A9v4hPVjQ7hNBGRNl1YPXYAciVAzqqYk5JeB9HFNJ5ouMwdsYEoVwLKE2N*99fkk/curvedSurface_Glazing.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/MOC7BqAcxPvE7XrRKrtrd5WfcuLxnBf5A9v4hPVjQ7hNBGRNl1YPXYAciVAzqqYk5JeB9HFNJ5ouMwdsYEoVwLKE2N*99fkk/curvedSurface_Glazing.png)\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\nPS: I still have to reply to your email.
