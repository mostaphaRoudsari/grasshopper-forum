{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI want to create a custom insulated concrete wall and be able to change insulation thickness in order to adjust the wall's U-value. Initially I tried to do it using existing materials but I noticed that, for example, insulation had a thickness of 20mm (while in my case I need to have from 100 to 200mm of insulation). So, I created an EP Construction using\n\na.an EP opaque material to create the insulation,\n\nb.a number slider to adjust the insulation thickness and\n\nc. a concrete wall from the EP library (I selected M15 200MM Heavyweight concrete).\n\nBut:\u00a0\n\n1. When I changed the insulation thickness, the final wall U-value did not update. I had to recompute everything in order to get the correct number.\n\n2. After having this issue, I created different insulation materials with different thicknesses (one 150mm and one 200mm) and two different wall types (respectively) but I got a lower U-value for less insulation which did not make sense (see Picture 1), so I assumed that this was happening because I had used by mistake the same material name. Therefore, I changed the names (let's say insulation1 and insulation2) and now... I get another error (see Picture 2) and I don't know what to do next.\u00a0\n\nTherefore my questions are:\u00a0\n\n1. What am I doing wrong?\n\n2. Is there a way to parametrically change material thickness, so as to use it as a gene for optimization? I also attach the definition\n\nThank you for all the help!\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/h-Z9hSNEhWDDZGS3-n*SLNKqTAqMSPgVjAGh7gUeBqtd0*XnNVVMOHWyXU470LicXpNfvsoKRITUR7QayOvXZRm4Mqntrl1L/custommaterials1.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/h-Z9hSNEhWDDZGS3-n*SLNKqTAqMSPgVjAGh7gUeBqtd0*XnNVVMOHWyXU470LicXpNfvsoKRITUR7QayOvXZRm4Mqntrl1L/custommaterials1.jpg)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/h-Z9hSNEhWBuhvH5qUzoFSkF-DZ6qlEu6mgrk8L1Zi5lcohEO7t4lerwWfaLwaw*jnAS9nLqDjTKG8lqoc2xmCisU1uU5b*0/custommaterials2.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/h-Z9hSNEhWBuhvH5qUzoFSkF-DZ6qlEu6mgrk8L1Zi5lcohEO7t4lerwWfaLwaw*jnAS9nLqDjTKG8lqoc2xmCisU1uU5b*0/custommaterials2.jpg)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/h-Z9hSNEhWAe3EZVaW*xQOIa3joxi38qNyEUu-S5J2KM1-R2EhPDaqYPHlOJJHJmbKEDVL1zwmM5svw-*Qhs0VRdV7H3WZpG/custommaterials2.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/h-Z9hSNEhWAe3EZVaW*xQOIa3joxi38qNyEUu-S5J2KM1-R2EhPDaqYPHlOJJHJmbKEDVL1zwmM5svw-*Qhs0VRdV7H3WZpG/custommaterials2.jpg)[<br/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/h-Z9hSNEhWCGTXN4uUy78NujjkwTB7D-2LKTPuaHL74P9*ryFZknv2MGABhbvQMvxuxZNeZKlmuGW9lh4EpzANNaOk5FlRhp/custommaterials2.jpg)[<br/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/h-Z9hSNEhWDTakr5x6Lj1s9qLWzNCzwE4DpW30nI2xTsgqo15qlbfCCb8Qbdb0qzB3LTUN1ri2DVX42c*8rpHPQ8CRxIFv8T/custommaterials2.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1551313", "name": "honeybee_custommaterials.gh"}], "created_by_name": "AMALIA VRANA", "created_at": "June 20, 2016 at 7:01am", "created_by": "AMALIAVRANA", "topic": "Custom Materials problem", "replies": [{"body": "\nAmalia,\n\nI tried to build a process of defining materials/constructions so you can get the picture.\n\nSee attached.
