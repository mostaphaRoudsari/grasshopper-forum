{"body": "\nHi there,\n\nI'm trying to create a MRT map just like the one Chris Macky created at the end of video 8 from his Honeybee video series on youtoube. However, I'm missing an output called \"zonesrfnames\" in the indoor view calculator component. Any idea where I went wrong?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nRania\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pl2AfYSHdf0B*H8tQLo8m0UeqJVzT0K6ocfYgw10995L1JFT6m02MqxHqG7DFbhUgPiplRu-GP3wKGkoM0-88eSkxDSJ9Tob/Canvasat.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pl2AfYSHdf0B*H8tQLo8m0UeqJVzT0K6ocfYgw10995L1JFT6m02MqxHqG7DFbhUgPiplRu-GP3wKGkoM0-88eSkxDSJ9Tob/Canvasat.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "February 27, 2015 at 11:22pm", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "topic": "My indoor view factor calculator component is missing output \"zonesrfnames\"", "replies": [{"body": "\nI've uploaded the files, it would be great if anyone can help me set up a MRT over the floor surface.
