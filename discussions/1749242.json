{"body": "\nDear All,\n\n\n\nAssuming we want to evaluate the thermal comfort conditions for occupants in a building, is there a way in Honeybee to take into account, in the comfort evaluation, the radiation entering the building through glazed facades and incident on an occupant?\n\nIn summary, is it possible to account for the fact that a person next to a glazed facade will be exposed to incident radiation?\n\nI assume for the moment the fact that the mean radiant temperature extracted from the results is only taking into account the effect of solar radiation absorbed by the surfaces (also glazing) of the building.\n\nAlthough, I would like to understand what is the additional effect of direct solar radiation on building occupants.\n\n\n\nI am not sure whether there is already a discussion answering specifically to this question. In case there is, could you please share the link to it?\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\n\nCarmelo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carmelo G.
