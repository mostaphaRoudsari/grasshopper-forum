{"body": "\nHello Everyone,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to do a cumultative radiation analyses. Something is going wrong in my generate cumultative sky and/or the selected sky matrix components. The selected sky matrix give a KeyError (1, ) for each of the skypatches. Also the cmd window for the cumultative sky matrix opens but doesn't give the familiar message. Instead it closes within a second before I have time to see what it says. I've done everything which was recommended for this same problem in this [thread](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/radiation-issues?groupUrl=ladybug), that is: I set the useOldres to off and replace\u00a0gendaymtx with the one from github.\u00a0\n\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nSam\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1474683", "name": "Cumulative_Radiation_Analysis_w_Ladybug.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Samuel de Vries", "created_at": "March 1, 2016 at 4:04am", "created_by": "SamueldeVries", "topic": "Radiation issue 2", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Samuel,\n\nHave you also unblocked the .exe file?\n\nIf that didn't work can you add a pause at the end of batch file and run it manually and report back the error?
