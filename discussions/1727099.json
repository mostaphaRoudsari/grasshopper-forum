{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nThis could be a very basic question, but when you have a room with 4 test surfaces facing different directions, how do you map the text to the mesh? Now every text is facing up with the 3D Tag component. Thanks! Rotating the point takes long when you have more than 40 test surfaces facing different directions.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"271\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/VoGkIWuAABYs*FA*-x6yEiCg1nztN*88Toxa6YcH*ldvdHnNx*MPbgZU*5mjz0tNAgNsVkeIjPrsreNIgeXBLxOy78GzKZgz/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"524\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/VoGkIWuAABYs*FA*-x6yEiCg1nztN*88Toxa6YcH*ldvdHnNx*MPbgZU*5mjz0tNAgNsVkeIjPrsreNIgeXBLxOy78GzKZgz/Capture.JPG)\n\nI searched in the forum and didn't find similar posts, but please let me know if there is any other post I should refer to.
