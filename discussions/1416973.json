{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI have a usual struggle, especially when dealing with architects who seem to prefer Sketchup.\n\n\n\nAs a result most of the models I receive are meshes. I can import in Rhino, and I do. I also know that I can transform meshes into nurbs in Rhino. However, all this process is usually time consuming (e.g. for some reason architect's roofs are 25 different meshes instead of one clean polymesh) and other times I simply run out of memory.\n\nAnyone knows a smart way of dealing with this, so that I can use the model with HB and LB components? Just trying to avoid modelling on top of sketchup meshes which is equal to remodelling the whole thing myself :(\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "December 7, 2015 at 10:46pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Meshes and HBLB", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "December 8, 2015 at 1:19am", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "replies": [{"body": "\nCreate HB surface does convert meshes to breps under the hood as Tasos mentioned but it can be very time-consuming.\n\nI usually re-create the geometries with a similar process as Tasos mentioned.

I haven't tested it myself but should be a much cleaner solution:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/jc/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAXEAAAAJDMwYTVlOTEzLTJkMWMtNGYwMC04MzY3LThjNzU1NWVhNTFiMw.png\"/>](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/jc/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAXEAAAAJDMwYTVlOTEzLTJkMWMtNGYwMC04MzY3LThjNzU1NWVhNTFiMw.png)\n\nHere is the project on github:\u00a0[https://github.com/moethu/SketchUpNET](https://github.com/moethu/SketchUpNET)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 9, 2015 at 8:35am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks Tasos and Mostapha.\n\n\n\nI did not know that I could do it with HB surface components!
