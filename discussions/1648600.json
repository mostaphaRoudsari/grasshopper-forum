{"body": "\nHi,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am wondering how I can get my results from my parametric study (Daylighting) into pollination without inputting the data manually? Is there anyway to record the results for all the iterations automatically within GH?\n\n\n\nFor example, I am setting up a study with 35 iterations with two design parameters and I am trying to have SDA and my design parameters as my 3 pollination parameters.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nWilly\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Willy Tsui", "created_at": "November 29, 2016 at 9:52pm", "created_by": "WillyTsui", "topic": "getting results to pollinate", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 30, 2016 at 6:17am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}], "id": "1648600"}
