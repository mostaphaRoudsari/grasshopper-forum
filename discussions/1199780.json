It won't load the ones from DIVA or any other customized version. You need to install radiance at c:\\radiance, and daysim at c:\\daysim. If you only want to use glareComponent then you need to download evalglare and copy it to c:\\radiance\\bin.\n\nHere is a fairly old video ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/how-to-get-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/how-to-get-radiance-and-daysim-installed)) and here is a post by James ([http://jramsden271.wordpress.com/2014/04/04/installing-honeybee-for...](http://jramsden271.wordpress.com/2014/04/04/installing-honeybee-for-grasshopper/)).\n\nOnce you have evalglare installed you should be able to run the analysis with no issue.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 6, 2015 at 11:19pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\ninstalled as you said, followed all steps...all errors are gone now (except for the energy plus which isn't needed here) but still getting this error (1.
