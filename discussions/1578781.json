Still, it doesn't hurt to give people the option of including it if she/he wants.\n\n2) Not all EnergyPlus models have all of the fan energy going into the air stream and (consequently) not all of it goes into the zone energy balance. \u00a0However, to date, all fan energy of Honeybee-generated models goes into the air stream so it's probably safe to say that this point is moot by now.\n\nGiven that I have just argued against my own reasons, I'll add an input for it very soon.\n\n-Chris\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 9, 2016 at 6:26am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you very much, Chris!\n\n\n\nI wonder if **fan energy use** might be an import item for analysis in natural ventilation modeling scenarios as specified in your demo file on hydra, especially in hot and humid climate.\n\n\n\n-Ji\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 9, 2016 at 11:31am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nJi,\n\n\n\nMy 2 cents is that it would be.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "August 9, 2016 at 3:34pm", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\n\n\nI have added it into the component as you see in the attached file and on the github. \u00a0The fan term is almost always going to be very small in relation to the nat vent term but I was at least able to see it on the chart when modeling an unconditioned building in San Francisco (unofficial capital of Natural Ventilation in the US) with the most inefficient fan that I could (0.5 total efficiency):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/S8fITn3IbtssL36KMP8q6Ij5NuSx9JF7xX7cs1M5NI4PFQphqHboJBbZg4yaJi5IM*SnSoZF1zc2GGaMwp9U4EzEkZf*qiSI/Fan2NatVent.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/S8fITn3IbtssL36KMP8q6Ij5NuSx9JF7xX7cs1M5NI4PFQphqHboJBbZg4yaJi5IM*SnSoZF1zc2GGaMwp9U4EzEkZf*qiSI/Fan2NatVent.JPG)\n\n\n\nThe fan term never seems to be much larger than 1/20th of the natural ventilation term and I think I may leave it out of my energy balance charts by disconnecting it from the energy balance component. \u00a0Still, we all have a right to know how small it is and that right has now been resorted :)\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1579620", "name": "NatVentFanTest.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 9, 2016 at 5:06pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you very much, Chris, for implementing this!\n\n\n\nI tested your workflow using Singapore's weather file, and here's the results:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/S8fITn3IbtvTki*UPRuoQx2NOMzQS7wV-yWMlMllEu8mJvmHZ0iI2S6ANVdqDqpy4KoFRmwlTA*ariatqld6N0xC70otCMXX/Image5.png\" width=\"648\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/S8fITn3IbtvTki*UPRuoQx2NOMzQS7wV-yWMlMllEu8mJvmHZ0iI2S6ANVdqDqpy4KoFRmwlTA*ariatqld6N0xC70otCMXX/Image5.png)\n\nSeems the fan electricity energy is a bit higher here, but still relatively lower than natural ventilation heat lost as you pointed out.\n\n\n\nBased on the image above, one suggestion here is that: will it be better if the order of the colors in the legend bar is consistent with that of the color patches shown for each month?
