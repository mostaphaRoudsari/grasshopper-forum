{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI\u00b4ve just started studying Chris Mackey\u00b4s wonderful tutorials on youtube about the Ladybug and Honeybee tools. I\u00b4ve downloaded and installed the latest versions from the website and began to try it immediately. While going through one of the first lessons, \u00a0I got an error with the \"Comfort Mannequin\" component. First it didnt work because it showed the message \"too many values to unpack\". So I looked up for similar errors in this forum and discovered the possible solution would be to use the update component. \u00a0After doing so I rebooted the system and now the component is still red but showing a different message:\u00a0**\"solution exception: global name 'bakelt_' is not defined\".\u00a0**Here I attach a print from the canvas.\u00a0\n\nAs you can imagine I am a begginer on Grasshopper and probably won\u00b4t be able to figure this out on my own. Any insghts on possible solutions to this problem will be very much apreciated!!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n**Thank you!!\u00a0**\n\n**\u00a0**\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1544413", "name": "ladybug_print 01.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Ana Carolina Moura", "created_at": "June 8, 2016 at 9:36am", "created_by": "AnaCarolinaMoura", "topic": "Comfort Mannequin component Error", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ana,\n\n\n\nHave you used \"\"Ladybug_Update Ladybug\" to update your LB version?<br/>If yes, Something went wrong.\u00a0\n\nI have just updated my LB version, this is what you should see.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/PS*5K4oSAl4NOJPfy51E6h*3IrWWZkuYpTbO*RGw3HUrraZqgW*IDumxwqXdCWYsyEPeXHfEO9h5wPFk3mwkh-nrUnW99jsE/update_LB_.png?width=450\" width=\"450\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/PS*5K4oSAl4NOJPfy51E6h*3IrWWZkuYpTbO*RGw3HUrraZqgW*IDumxwqXdCWYsyEPeXHfEO9h5wPFk3mwkh-nrUnW99jsE/update_LB_.png)\n\n\n\nYou can find a possible solution here:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/error-with-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/error-with-comfort-mannequin?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1543225&amp;xg_source=msg_com_gr_forum)\n\n\n\nBest\n\nAntonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "June 8, 2016 at 11:16am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": [{"body": "\nYes I had used the update component but, as you said before, something must have went wrong with it.
