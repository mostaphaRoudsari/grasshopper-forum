In theory it should work for you but in general for changing between the versions I would suggest to remove the current version, download the files from Food4Rhino, install them and then use the update component to get the latest version.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 19, 2015 at 7:13am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nhallo Mostapha,\n\n\n\njust quick info. i just realized this, maybe it is a bug too...when i update the objects through update honeybee object, it was created as : testSurface and not with _testSurface. the sea for gridsize and distbasesrf. check attached file.\n\nbut when i drag the object from the menu again, it was fine.\n\n\n\nhave a good day!\n\n\n\nn.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1269920", "name": "Bildschirmfoto 2015-04-22 um 17.17.53.png"}], "created_by_name": "nass", "created_at": "April 22, 2015 at 9:23am", "created_by": "joe88", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi nass,\n\nThank you for reporting this. This is more of a limitation than a bug. Update component just updates the code and doesn't really check for changes in inputs and outputs. As I mentioned above when I originally developed the component I was thinking that it will be only used by developers and they will take care of limitations like this. Now that it is getting used by everyone maybe I should modify the code to take care of these changes.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 22, 2015 at 4:13pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}]}
