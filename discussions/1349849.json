{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI am trying to perform a detailed thermal comfort analyses with HB.\n\nI have used some of the example files for learning how to create the code structure but I still have several issues if I want to personalize the code.\n\n\n\nThink about a simple box with a couple of zones and a window for each zone. I would like to define all the parameters (U value, SGHC, etc.) without using the EP library. I found the components but I have some issues to combine them in a correct way.\n\n\n\nFurthermore I would like to set my own schedules and internal gains, without using the default programs. I am quite sure it is possible because there are components which could fit this, but I have still not found a way to make it work.\n\n\n\nCould you please help me?\n\n\n\nMy final goal would be to combine thermal comfort and daylighting analyses in order to find the best temperature set points according to glass properties.\n\n\n\nThanks everyone.\n\n\n\nRiccardo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Riccardo Diaferia", "created_at": "August 27, 2015 at 5:21am", "created_by": "RiccardoDiaferia49", "topic": "Detailes thermal comfort analyses", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Riccardo\u00a0\n\n\n\nCould you post your GH file and then in your GH file detail what you are having trouble with?
