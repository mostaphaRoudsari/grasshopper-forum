{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI opened an old file, updated all the component (from Honeybee 0.0.56 to 0.0.58) and the new component 0.0.58 for daylight analysis\u00a0Read Annual Result I is not working. You can see the error message. I copy pasted the old one 0.0.56 and it works (with the same inputs). What can be wrong?

My bad. I should have guessed as it was very obvious. Now I see the issue. file name should be ended by .csv (e.g. Rukki_7_22_MonSat.csv) otherwise component assumes you're using an energyplus schedule for the schedule and that's why it gave you the warning that it can't be found. The older version was working fine as it didn't have the new feature to accept EnergyPlus schedule as an input.\n\nI added an extra check to generate occupancy file to add it for you in case you haven't as an input.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/GHjisZ0-*ySa6wa6nXdVRqi5pskfl7LY81zF7SZ*Kp7giOqJIIpSepFGdbjeNQspElTxM9b4PRK7Eif6kZYkArLVL3AiRHDk/annualDaylightSchedule.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/GHjisZ0-*ySa6wa6nXdVRqi5pskfl7LY81zF7SZ*Kp7giOqJIIpSepFGdbjeNQspElTxM9b4PRK7Eif6kZYkArLVL3AiRHDk/annualDaylightSchedule.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 1, 2015 at 8:05am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nMostapha, ok good thank you!!
