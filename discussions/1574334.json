This way is very fast especially with occupancy schedules.\n\nOR\n\nb) Native components of GH: for example 'duplicate data' component or by writing a list of 24 values manually.\n\n\n\nThe second step is to connect daily schedules to HB annual schedule.\n\nYou can choose if you want to include holidays in your schedule:\n\na) you can use the internal library of the component by using EPW file input, this option considers just national holidays (regional and local holidays are not considered)\n\nb) you can create your own holidays with the overwriteHolidays input\n\n\n\nI strongly suggest you take a look at Chris' examples where the schedule components are used\n\n\n\nBest\n\nAntonello\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "August 11, 2016 at 2:57am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": []}]}]}
