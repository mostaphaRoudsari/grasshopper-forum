{"body": "\nHi every one\n\nI have a double skin kinetic facade and\u00a0I am trying to model that in honey bee ... I made two separate zones ...first: my room....and second: the zone between two skin.\n\nNow I want to model this zones to energy analyses in honey bee.\n\nBut I don't know with witch component I can add kinetic skin to analyze?? Windows Shade generator or which one???\n\nI can,t find appropriate tutorial to kinetic facade simulation.\n\nRegards\n\nMoein\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1668434", "name": "kinetic facade problem.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "moein", "created_at": "January 8, 2017 at 3:06am", "created_by": "moein", "topic": "connecting kinetic facade in honey bee problem", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 8, 2017 at 9:00am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nthanks Cris\n\nI saw this example...this is helpful...but my facade isn't simple blind.\n\nmy facade's modules are a little complex\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/K*6yCKTfahS6KeJe4SNn*uH5GNR4zvtLPnbgSwMKBYha8zp4wLoA2i5FKawzCIvpRSblehNS8vt62MaDynDVYShf9861fQi4/kineticfacadeproblem.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/K*6yCKTfahS6KeJe4SNn*uH5GNR4zvtLPnbgSwMKBYha8zp4wLoA2i5FKawzCIvpRSblehNS8vt62MaDynDVYShf9861fQi4/kineticfacadeproblem.JPG)\u00a0 I can't use \"Windows Shade Generator\" component....right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "moein", "created_at": "January 8, 2017 at 12:11pm", "created_by": "moein", "replies": []}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 8, 2017 at 1:11pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nbut amount and direction of openings effect on the speed and direction of wind\n\nmy purpose is kinetic facade design to increase of air flow in the zone\n\nI want to find best amount of opening On different days of year based on my purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "moein", "created_at": "January 9, 2017 at 1:28am", "created_by": "moein", "replies": []}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 9, 2017 at 6:29am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nthank you so much Chris\n\nbut I think I can't explain What I mean\n\nmy kinetic facade is not simple shade like that example...in the example you defined shade as simple blind with \"Windows shade generator\" component.\n\nbut I can do this. because I have different shades.\n\nnow I want to find appropriate component instead \"windows shade generator\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "moein", "created_at": "January 9, 2017 at 7:55am", "created_by": "moein", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nWho can give me answer?\n\nI am waiting.\n\nThanks\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "moein", "created_at": "January 11, 2017 at 9:48am", "created_by": "moein", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n\n\nHi\u00a0Moein,\u00a0\n\nRefer to your email as your case study is near of mine, Chris &amp;

Are you looking to figure out the airflow pattern inside the space based on the details of the facade? or are you trying to realize the relationship between the air-change and the energy consumption inside the room. For the former you need to run a CFD analysis and for the latter you should to simplify your model as all the small pieces in the facade just adds to the time of the calculation.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 15, 2017 at 3:59pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}]}
