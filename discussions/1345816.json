{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nWe had some students installed multiple copies of LB+HB on our lab computers. There are also students who installed LB+HB, but the component is not usable, such as the LB component dragged on the canvas appears as an empty panel.\n\n\n\nIn other situation, the LB components are all gone when they open the demo file we prepared for them on their computer with LB+HB installed. In this situation, it seems the GHPython component is broken - it appears as a blank panel on canvas.\n\n\n\n(sorry, didn't manage to save a screen image for the problems described here)\n\n\n\nCurrently, we ask them to remove LB+HB using the **remove** component, restart Rhino and GH, and try a fresh installation, and see if this works...\n\n\n\nNevertheless, pls kindly advise if you have encountered similar problems before.\n\n\n\nThank you very much!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 19, 2015 at 8:51am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "[urgent] duplicate installation and unusable components", "replies": [{"body": "\nOk, I found one post on installation problem:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/ladybug-installation-prob...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/ladybug-installation-problems?groupUrl=ladybug&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987&amp;id=2985220%3ATopic%3A966496&amp;page=1#comments)\n\n\n\nAnyway, appreciate your advice!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 19, 2015 at 8:57am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\n\n\nFor the ones with duplicate installations your process should work.\n\n\n\nFor empty components it is almost always the result of not having GHPython installed correctly. It can be an issue with unblocking the component or not having the right version of GHPython component. Let them open a GHPython component and check the version and make sure it is 0.6.0.3\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KkxqEnBJGWAcQVxBGcPknSkLpSoXj4nQkGg6hEd000s7ZVP4uvhoXwRRYFAr7Pym-EKUxAbck-JUlISDMCAowQc1ot*xDQY8/GHPython_version.PNG\" width=\"664\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KkxqEnBJGWAcQVxBGcPknSkLpSoXj4nQkGg6hEd000s7ZVP4uvhoXwRRYFAr7Pym-EKUxAbck-JUlISDMCAowQc1ot*xDQY8/GHPython_version.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 19, 2015 at 9:01am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThis can be also useful if they don't know how to unblock the components:\u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/photo/unblock-gh-libraries?context=latest](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/photo/unblock-gh-libraries?context=latest)\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 19, 2015 at 9:02am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you very much, Mostapha, for the prompt reply!
