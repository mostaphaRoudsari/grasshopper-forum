{"body": "\nHello everyone,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'm trying to run a very simple daylight analysis, but I have an issue with the calcul of daylight autonomy : \"\u00a01. Number of points in ill files: -3 doesn't match the number of points in point files: 3248\".\n\nI can't fix this, can you help me please (file attached)?\n\nIlona\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1424593", "name": "Daylight Analysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "ilona darmon", "created_at": "December 21, 2015 at 8:39am", "created_by": "ilonadarmon", "topic": "Error with HB - Read annual result component", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Ilona,\n\n\n\nThe simulation you are running is point in time illuminance. In order to get .ill files for daylight autonomy, you need to run the Honeybee_Annual_Daylight_Simulation instead.\u00a0\n\nThen you can use the Honeybee_Lookup Daylight Folder component which will give you the location of the .ill files.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\n\nByron\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "byron mardas", "created_at": "December 21, 2015 at 9:17am", "created_by": "byronmardas", "replies": []}], "id": "1424594"}
