In your case the wall was \"lucky\" but the roof doesn't. In this case you can simulate but the results are \"garbage\" since the roof is just a hole without the glazing. See attached.\n\nBasically you need to assign a window(s) to a specific surface. You can get more parametric and define a percentage for each orientation. Not sure how to deal here with different materials, but maybe it is possible.\n\nCan't see any more effective way to deal with this ...\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1302620", "name": "LightingComfort_v1b_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 4, 2015 at 8:54am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHave you tried to graft the windows, walls and materials.
