In general you are right and you can add glazing only to surfaces and not zones [which can get fixed by modifying the component. I think it totally makes sense to be able to add all the glazing to the zone at the same time]\n\nAt the same time, as far as you draw openings correctly on top of the surfaces (no gap between the opening surface and the wall/roof, and same normal direction), and know how to manage data in Grasshopper, you can do it all at once. check this example where I add a number of windows to two different zones. Honeybee_addHBGlazing component does the matching process inside.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-HoKvkav3swxFOWFyVHSPcPsx-x6dIEjH8RY5M4cZ1vIsmHpOslBBMhpGV08yxWK2Tq-HaHt7F-ptcqS3O6Weal5bFns9dvu/addMultipleGlazingToZones.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-HoKvkav3swxFOWFyVHSPcPsx-x6dIEjH8RY5M4cZ1vIsmHpOslBBMhpGV08yxWK2Tq-HaHt7F-ptcqS3O6Weal5bFns9dvu/addMultipleGlazingToZones.png)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1314267", "name": "addMultipleGlazingToZones.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 23, 2015 at 7:50am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nAs i said a while ago: Knowledge is power!!\n\nGood one Mostapha :-)\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 23, 2015 at 8:26am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks Abraham! :)\n\nI just made it one level easier.

I just got time to reply this old post.\n\n\n\nI manage to use your approach to add glazing surface(s) to individual HB zones, using the following steps:\n\n1. create geometries for zones, import into GH via Brep, and then intersect zone geometries\n\n2. use mass2Zones to convert intersected zone geometries into HB zones, add zone program etc.\n\n3. add glazing surfaces to HB zones individually\n\n4. merge HB zones with glazings added\n\n5. solve adjacency between HB zones with glazings\n\n\n\nHowever, I don't quite understand the data structure in the workflow:\n\n1. in your approach, the output of the ****addHBGlz**** is a list with two branches, each having one HB zone (see image 1 below)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cxNDsYnHlWRPJVqNh9EDRH9Yf*1KoKNxVtU9R4e513vNsLO2ec7SieCCBBZg2aNVPC4SzTGM-X2mPVqB67BKfHHtuMXCAZ2O/01.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cxNDsYnHlWRPJVqNh9EDRH9Yf*1KoKNxVtU9R4e513vNsLO2ec7SieCCBBZg2aNVPC4SzTGM-X2mPVqB67BKfHHtuMXCAZ2O/01.PNG)\n\n2.
