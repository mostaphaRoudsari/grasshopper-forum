{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI am not sure if this is a question or a request, might be both.\n\n\n\nOkay let's imagine we want to model a high-rise building with something like 50+ floors.\n\n\n\nWe always start simple, so we model a typical floor. We pass the Rhino model to HB, create our zones, add our glazing, shading surfaces, and we run our first simulations.\n\n\n\nNext step, we want to model a few different floors, that might represent the building's performance better (e.g. lower floor, middle floor, penthouse). How can we go from the typical floor (which probably took a couple of days to model surface by surface) to multiple floors without re-doing the whole process? It would be great if there was a way to simply copy paste everything and new zones would be created, since they are the same. I understand that this might be a grasshopper limitation, as breps are location specific in Rhino (I think?).\n\n\n\nStill a way to quickly set up any number of clones of our typical floor withn HB would save countless hours. Also, if this is already there in some kind of way I apologize, and cool!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "September 8, 2015 at 1:42am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Modeling high rise buildings in HB", "replies": [{"body": "\nI may be answering my own question here but would native transformation GH components work here?\n\n\n\nCould I copy the group of components defining a zone and then move it vertically to position it at the second floor?

This is because we have to perform the geometry transformation BEFORE turning the geometry into HBZones, which means that all of the properties that you change/assign to your original zones have to be done again to the new transformed zones as well. \u00a0Oftentimes, I have repeating floors and I just want to keep these same zone properties through the geometric transformation.\n\nThings get particularly out of hand if you have to do such transformations more than 2 times (I had to do it for a 5-story building once).\n\nTo address this issue, I have had it on my agenda for a while to make a component that re-evaluates HBZone geometry and adds any zones transformed with native GH components\u00a0to the HB hive as new HBZones. \u00a0This way, you could perform any of the common transforms to zone geometry (translation, scale, rotation, reflection) and have Honeybee able to understand these zones as geometrically-altered versions of the original zones.\n\nI forgot to make this agenda item into a githib issue but now that you have reminded me...\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/373](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/373)\n\nI will try to get to this sometime soon.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 8, 2015 at 11:12pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHo Mostapha and Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for the input.\n\n\n\nI agree with all of your comments. Copying is the only way I'm doing it now but as Chris mentioned that requires us to re-set all the material information. This actually works like a charm in Daylighting studies mainly due to no limitation from radiance side to closed zones and so on. All I need to do for daylighting is make sure that all surfaces are divided in layers and then copy paste as many floors I want and input each layer in a brep afterwards.\n\n\n\nI think if we can use native components to add zones to HB that would have an immense impact to our models (or maybe just mine :) ). So it's good news this is added on the list.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "September 9, 2015 at 8:55pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nI agree that we need to address this issue however I suggest a different approach.
