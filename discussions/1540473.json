{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI am working on a Ladybug sheet calculating the solar radiation received at a specific location at every hour and day of the year.\n\n\n\nSo I have a list of a few thousands values of radiations, that I calculated from the sun's positions throughout the year using \"SunPositions\" of \"SunPath\". I can also get the dates and times corresponding thanks to \"SunPositionsInfo\" of \"SunPath\" component.\n\n\n\nNow I want to sum, for every day, the radiations received bu the surface in order to calculate the total daily radiation.\n\n\n\nMy problem is that I don't know how to detect and inquire change of date, and then how to sum values of each day to obtain a list of 365 daily values. The Ladybug sheet explaining my issue is attached.\n\n\n\nCan anyone help me with that ? :)\n\n\n\nThanks !\n\n\n\nYoan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1540472", "name": "20160602_DailySolarRadiation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Yoan", "created_at": "June 2, 2016 at 2:04am", "created_by": "Yoan", "topic": "How to calculate solar radiation during an entire day ?", "replies": [{"body": "\nI think your primary issue is you may want to revise the components you are using. I recommend building up a logic using the radiation analysis component. From it you can get the sum radiation for a specified range.\n\nIf it was me, I would set this up. Then automate sliders connected to a date range which step through each day. And have the results recorded in something like Excel through export and reporting add-on components That way I could track sum changes for each day in a relative efficient manner.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-aaxVkq0WH6iTDS2A6e3v6z9rNUJiyz4oE*f4yxO5USIxAqHHiFgj8H*xsppXvrFisCYnoUvPf-xPSWHs6m1iw-35FgmPv-P/RadiationAnalysis.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-aaxVkq0WH6iTDS2A6e3v6z9rNUJiyz4oE*f4yxO5USIxAqHHiFgj8H*xsppXvrFisCYnoUvPf-xPSWHs6m1iw-35FgmPv-P/RadiationAnalysis.JPG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dustin Altschul", "created_at": "June 2, 2016 at 2:27am", "created_by": "DustinAltschul", "replies": [{"body": "\nHello Dustin,\n\nThank you for your answer ! I'm just starting with Ladybug and I had not seen we could do some radiation analysis ! So I made a sheet calculating it from the formulas I had. I guess I have some other tutorials to watch :) Thanks for letting me know about it.\n\nActually my problem was not really about radiation calculation but more some original Grasshopper treatment but anyways, I managed to solve the problem already !\n\n\n\nYoan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yoan", "created_at": "June 2, 2016 at 8:02pm", "created_by": "Yoan", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHi Yoan,\n\n\n\nTry this workflow where I used native components of GH. If I have understood correctly, you mean daily solar direct radiation of your specific location without using EPW file.\n\n\n\nIf you want to do solar radiation analysis of geometries you should use LB_RadiationAnalysis as Dustin told you.\n\n\n\nBest<br/>Antonello\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1540392", "name": "20160602_DailySolarRadiation_A.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "June 2, 2016 at 4:08am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Yoan,\n\n\n\nI'm sorry for my previous answer, some steps of the workflow aren't necessary.

Your method works perfectly for what I wanted to do and is very optimal. You're right it was just an issue about native component, but since it used Ladybug components, I thought it was best to ask about it on this forum. Anyways, problem solved !
