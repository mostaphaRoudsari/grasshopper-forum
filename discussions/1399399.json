{"body": "\nHi, I have two questions:\n\n\n\n1. Can I use EnergyPlus Version 7.2 with honeybee ? If there is something that forces Honeybee to use the latest version of EnergyPlus can I disable that and use 7.2.\n\n\n\n2. Secondly, is it possible to color different zones according to the energy consumed for cooling annually ?\n\n\n\nThanks,<br/> Sarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "November 12, 2015 at 7:06pm", "created_by": "sarith", "topic": "Using old version of EnergyPlus and Coloring zones by energy consumption", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Sarith,\n\n\n\n1. I assume some of the output fields has changed, otherwise it should work fine. If you want to change the version to 7.2 modify versions in Honeybee_honeybee ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeyb...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeybee_Honeybee.py#L7694-L7696)).\n\n\n\n2. Yes. Here is an example ([http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=EnergyPlus_Simulation)). Change the preview from the component to custom preview to have the zone colored instead of the floor.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 12, 2015 at 8:30pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha !\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "November 12, 2015 at 9:03pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1399399"}
