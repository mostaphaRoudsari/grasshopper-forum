The smaller the latitude, the smaller the tilt angle.<br/>Still getting exactly 0.00 value, sounds like a precision issue. Try increasing the \"precision_\" input parameter to, say \"20\". If it does not take too long for the \"TOF\" component to recalculate, you can increase this value even higher. The larger the \"precision_\" input value is, the more precise your optimal tilt and azimuth values will be.<br/><br/>Hope that helps. If not, please let me know.\n\nFor future issues, it is always helpful when one attaches the .gh file along with posting a question.

Sorry for not seeing it, and not refreshing the page.<br/><br/>Yes, I assume that this is the problem: your epw file does not contain the separate directNormalRadiation and diffuseHorizontalRadiation. This is why you are always getting zero optimal tilt angle.<br/>Chris recently posted a\u00a0[link to other free epw files](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/EnergyPlus_Support/files/Meteonorm_Weather_Files/) not released by US department of energy.
