{"body": "\nI'm curious about the hemispheric sampling referenced in this presentation.\n\n[http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca...](http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day1/JM_AmbientCalculation.pdf)\n\nIf I'm interested in spherical sampling of a space, how would that work when you want to sample something in open space rather than on a surface? I noticed that the results are highly dependent on normal of the surface used to generate the sample points and mesh. This poses a problem when looking to get a good idea of how light behaves in an open space like an atrium sampling in section (see images). I'll create some additional examples.\u00a0\n\nWould you generate results for the two hemispheres and combine results additively?\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1188299", "name": "141203 L4 Section 1.0.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "will krzymowski", "created_at": "December 15, 2014 at 11:21am", "created_by": "willkrzymowski", "topic": "Hemispheric Sampling", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Will, I replied to the question here: [http://www.grasshopper3d.com/xn/detail/2985220:Comment:1188792](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/xn/detail/2985220:Comment:1188792)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 15, 2014 at 11:25pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}
