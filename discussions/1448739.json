What I understand is that the \"Shade Creator\" give us the area of the Roof that depend on our percentage to keep. And what I confused is how to take that information to the next step, is that the best shape for these roofs? what could i do with that \"benefit area\" and not benefit area.

You can do this using the components showed on the image below.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/*p4tHM5XSkMs6BOlTfJAFBG0OEM281B95dcJ0bGm5*T-i8uItQamcdg7fyBRvEbf6C6AEw-tf27bP9sg5714LSv4oJNvP3Yl/Update.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/*p4tHM5XSkMs6BOlTfJAFBG0OEM281B95dcJ0bGm5*T-i8uItQamcdg7fyBRvEbf6C6AEw-tf27bP9sg5714LSv4oJNvP3Yl/Update.png)\n\nAbout your legend, I should check your gh file. I only see the gridsize_ that you used is really big.\n\nI have done an example, you could compare your file with it.\n\nAs you can read from the description of the Ladybug_Comfort Shade Benefit Evaluator:\n\n\"\u00a0A higher saturation of **blue** indicates that **shading** the cell is **very desirable**. \u00a0A higher saturation of **red** indicates that shading the cell is harmful (**blocking more winter sun** than summer sun)[not good]. Desaturated cells [**white**] indicate that shading the cell will have **relatively little effect** on outdoor comfort. [negligible]\"\n\nThe units are net temperture degree-days. Using the Honeybee_Optimal Shade Creator you say: Ok! with my shade brep I can save 150 degree-days for cooling (for example) but I want it to work at 50% or 60% or 65% and so on. Changing \"percentToKeep_\"\u00a0it resizes the shade brep and its performance, too. For example, I can save 100 degree-days putting 60% instead of 150 degree-days with 100%. But it's also true that you can exclude \"white areas\" that aren't useful and \"red areas\". For all these reasons, almost all examples about this kind of analysis start with oversized shade breps, so it let you to get the best shapes for you deleting out unwanted areas.\n\nBests\n\nAntonello\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1449435", "name": "Shade_Benefit_test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "January 28, 2016 at 3:05pm", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": [{"body": "\nReally helpful, I will try to see what happen.
