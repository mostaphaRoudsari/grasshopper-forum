Pollination is the first part of a series of web-based developments for Ladybug+Honeybee to explore possibilities for better data visualization.\u00a0[Pollination](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/tree/gh-pages)&lt;Vis&gt; in particular is designed for exploring multi-dimensional data.\n\n\n\nThe idea of\u00a0[Pollination](http://honeypatch.github.io/pollination/index) born at the [AEC-TECH Hackathon](http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-technology-symposium-2014/aec-technology-symposium-2014-hackathon/)\u00a0last year. I want to\u00a0thank all the [team members](http://honeypatch.github.io/pollination/team)\u00a0for the great original work. Also many thanks to [Kai Chang](https://github.com/syntagmatic) for developing [ParallelCoordinates](https://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/)\u00a0library for [D3JS](http://d3js.org/). Creating Pollination would be very very hard without his development.\n\n\n\nHere is a very short video that shows how you can interact with data and load your own files. As you can see in the video I added to components to Honeybee that helps you generate an structured .csv file from Grasshopper. You can also generate the files manually.\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"420\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OgdPaAgpOcQ?wmode=opaque\" width=\"420\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n\nThe data doesn't need to be results of Honeybee or Ladybug. Feel free to use pollination for any other studies including your multi-dimensional optimization cases!\n\n\n\nOK! That's all I have for now. Check the webpage [here](http://mostapharoudsari.github.io/Honeybee/Pollination)\u00a0and the source code on [github](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/tree/gh-pages).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: If you are interested in data visualization and multi-dimensional data then I strongly recommend you to watch this presentation by Kai.\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"560\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypc7Ul9LkxA?wmode=opaque\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 5:06pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "topic": "[New Development] Pollination for exploring multi-dimensional data", "replies": [{"body": "\nGreat work !!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 5:27pm", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nGreat work Mostapha and team!

Following that, you simply input the new range into the color gradient, which translates the 0 to green as in the case above, or 1 to red. I have attached the script that I used for my thesis which include the other tools that were set up as part of my thesis.

I am guessing that once they are all in the same range (i.e. 0 to 1) you can start adding/subtracting them to get your best performing solution or you could even weight the objectives based on your own criteria (i.e. daylight more important than cooling load).

I internalized all the meshes that were produced into a 'mesh' bucket. Using the indices - which would be the same as the ID number - I would be able to relate the quantitative data to the the 3D mesh, i.e. mesh ID 1 would extract index 1 or row 1 of the respective values. The downside of that workflow though is you would be storing anywhere from 1000 to 3000 solutions which would make your gh file significantly large.\n\nConcerning weights: I didn't dive into that part but through 'filtering' you do somewhat subjectively add weight to solutions, e.g. solutions that perform in the 95th percentile of daylight, etc.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-Y\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yassin Ashour", "created_at": "February 19, 2016 at 3:50am", "created_by": "YassinAshour450", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nGreat Work guys can't wait to try it\n\n\n\nKeep on the good work\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 6:36pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nGreat work Mostapha!\n\n\n\nCan't wait for this to be fully integrated with the Honeybee energyplus components.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 7:50pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nVery nice!!\n\nThanks Mostapha and Pollination team.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 10:18pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nGreat - as usual!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "February 23, 2015 at 10:23am", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nhm, i missed this post somehow, this is great!\u00a0\n\nalso made me think about the looking for some tools to turn csv data into a JSON that has some structure like nested columns and etc, sort of like\u00a0[a page like this](http://ocds.open-contracting.org/standard/r/1__0__RC/en/schema/release/). If you push a little plus mark the column will unfold and expand.\n\nI am volunteering currently for this project when I have time [https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/CROL-PDF](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/CROL-PDF)\n\nand there is a discussion of standardizing information extracted from pdfs into csv, then eventually to a json schema so that a large amount of information can be shared easily online and also visualized to allow filtering and making operations on a data set. The closest thing I know is\u00a0[http://openrefine.org/](http://openrefine.org/)\u00a0but it is not an online app and not really a collaborative platform.\n\nanyhow, columns with nested columns showing imgs with tables that corresponds to a set of paramters might be a good suppliment to parallel coordinates. since honeybee and ladybug now has a quite a large collection of analysis so if there is a way to create a pipeline from grasshopper to, yeah, something like github.io like you have it here, with a well designed JSON schema with fold-expand columns it might be a great way to keep track. just an idea, dont know how this could be achieved yet.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "March 12, 2015 at 4:10am", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "replies": []}]}
