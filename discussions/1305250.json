Attached to your files as May 31st and June 7th versions respectively. But when I download the latest HB (just now) I get Run ES May 31st with no HBGenerators input; and Generate EP Feb_01_2015 not Jun_07_2015 - so this component is generally not working now. You can see the latest versions I can get on the PDF attached and I assume the same for all. Or is it?
