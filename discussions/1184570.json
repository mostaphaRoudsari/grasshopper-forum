I think you are checking a different version of Honeybee_Honeybee.

If you check output of Ladybug_Ladybug component it should tell you where the default folder is set to. It can be C:\\Ladybug or\u00a0C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\\. Can you check and see if the folder is already created? If not can you create it and let the Honeybee fly again?\n\n\n\nAnother reason that I can think of is the %USERNAME% on your system.

It is definitely on my end so thank you for your prods to get me thinking about this further. Our local-user folders get setup with our username and then the office-server appended to our user-name folder.\n\nSo I have two folders, one that is USERNAME.IG and one that is USERNAME. Ladybug was looking at the latter, just user name, no strange extension. Yet Grasshopper and the components live native in the USERNAME.IG\\AppData\\Roaming\\Grasshopper\n\n\n\nI will definitely talk with my IT department about this and why exactly the .IG is necessary.\n\nWhen I first step the added items under \\ladybug, I figured it made the most sense to place the folder under .IG since grasshopper was in there.
