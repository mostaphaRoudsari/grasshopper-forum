{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI was trying to run the basic energy simulation for the example you shared in your tutorial videos and it was giving me the following errors:\n\n1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> ** Severe ** Problem in interior solar distribution calculation (CHKBKS)\n\n2. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> ** Severe ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 2 surfaces which are casting surfaces and are non-convex.\n\nRecently I updated HB and LB, and I have never seen these errors when I tried the former version.\n\nI tried to breakup all the zones in each floor with air walls, however, it seems dosen't work. <br/>I would be appreciate for any suggestions to solve this problem.\n\nThank you,\n\nRoy\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1655379", "name": "Running a basic simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Yi LUO", "created_at": "December 10, 2016 at 8:10pm", "created_by": "YiLUO", "topic": "EnergyPlus simulation errors about  solar distribution calculation and non-convex zones", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Roy,\n\nPlease check attached file.\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1655818", "name": "Runningabasicsimulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "December 11, 2016 at 8:41am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": []}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yi LUO", "created_at": "December 12, 2016 at 7:21am", "created_by": "YiLUO", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\nIf I may ask you where can I download the LB and HB of \"VER 0.0.60\\nAUG_26_2016\" like you added in the file?

It's very easy. Find Honeybee_Update Honeybee component. It is in tab 12. Once you have that component on canvas, do the following.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8kkt4Vvp7GwTSagKL48fBD2zjHZ9rssDMgTdToUaGrqgkoCSAvcQcJ9pacgk7VHA3eI9VVXty80h5U7B*60XntYYVRoAwhsO/ScreenClip.png\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/8kkt4Vvp7GwTSagKL48fBD2zjHZ9rssDMgTdToUaGrqgkoCSAvcQcJ9pacgk7VHA3eI9VVXty80h5U7B*60XntYYVRoAwhsO/ScreenClip.png)It will take a few seconds to update your components. You can also update all the Honeybee objects ( the ones you don't have on canvas as well) by attaching a boolean toggle to _updateAllUobjects.\n\n\n\nTo update Ladybug, the process is quite similar. For that you use Ladybug_Update Ladybug found in tab 6.\n\n\n\n-Devang\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "December 14, 2016 at 2:59am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "\nIt's really helpful!
