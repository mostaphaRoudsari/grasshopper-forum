It can have several reasons but most probably is the result of a wrong material or sky. Can you check the folder and run\u00a0&lt;your project name&gt;_RADInit.bat file after adding a PAUSE at the end of the file. This way you should be able to read the error.\n\n\n\nIn the future we should add an error log \u00a0for init file so you don't have to do that manually.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 1, 2016 at 10:19am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}
