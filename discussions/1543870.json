{"body": "\nHello forum,\n\nI was doing some simulation analysis with these two methods and had some strange results.

I think the rays intersect the glass_material first so we get to see inside the room. The next one is without the glass. As you can see there is no recess inside the wall. The final one is without the walls.\n\n\n\nIn a physically based renderer like Radiance, for accurate results the geometry should mimic reality. The only way to actually punch into material using Radiance is to use [Antimatter](http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html#Antimatter).\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/PS*5K4oSAl6axvw1c4K60YdOxBHo0t7vWA8TK4HXhEaHbCJrS6khZvpIj0UTUkSGsqXlI7ZNJvmCPIwIrRI3TTZZVa35u*4z/1.PNG\" width=\"625\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/PS*5K4oSAl6axvw1c4K60YdOxBHo0t7vWA8TK4HXhEaHbCJrS6khZvpIj0UTUkSGsqXlI7ZNJvmCPIwIrRI3TTZZVa35u*4z/1.PNG)[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/PS*5K4oSAl51ntUsyQADNKEPooYbMpQTk8NuFMV7yTuHCvhT2OSa1FqpziIt7S2U54Z6hUqv42F4xePj7cjbpDGrJQ3xmWYf/2.PNG\" width=\"627\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/PS*5K4oSAl51ntUsyQADNKEPooYbMpQTk8NuFMV7yTuHCvhT2OSa1FqpziIt7S2U54Z6hUqv42F4xePj7cjbpDGrJQ3xmWYf/2.PNG)[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/PS*5K4oSAl6xw7RZPsiAS2cWvL4-i-7Yq1M3SAEN1itL8Qq2WuSe6JT3TNynbHaSEgaG89GKpugLe-sRGp0tbkoS*ShyTIJc/3.PNG\" width=\"625\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/PS*5K4oSAl6xw7RZPsiAS2cWvL4-i-7Yq1M3SAEN1itL8Qq2WuSe6JT3TNynbHaSEgaG89GKpugLe-sRGp0tbkoS*ShyTIJc/3.PNG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "June 8, 2016 at 11:56am", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": [{"body": "\nIf you don't want to manually subtract the geometries you can use addHBGlz component to add glazing to a surface.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 9, 2016 at 10:15am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\u00a0\n\nI know, I tried your's and Chris's methods and they all give the same results, could you please test the file for me?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "June 12, 2016 at 8:22am", "created_by": "Timur582", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHey Sarith,\n\nI did like Mostapha said, also checked the method with another analysis and it gave me expected results, still have no idea why image based analysis didn't work.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/PdXXQXB083XxGR0V0*Pw-G8mZRgSnhxk8Dr6IFLiz14BdNXhey8zYudeyemgQKVamfrOiNUe3000LTLhkQscet17Hv-BEMi0/an.PNG\" width=\"342\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/PdXXQXB083XxGR0V0*Pw-G8mZRgSnhxk8Dr6IFLiz14BdNXhey8zYudeyemgQKVamfrOiNUe3000LTLhkQscet17Hv-BEMi0/an.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "June 13, 2016 at 11:19pm", "created_by": "Timur582", "replies": []}]}]}
