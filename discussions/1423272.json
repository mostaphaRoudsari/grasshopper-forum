{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\ni\u00b4ve got a problem with daylight simulation.\n\nSome windows are counted as radiance material and some windows are not.\n\nI\u00b4ve checked (with itersect tool in rhino)\u00a0if they all are coplanar with the wall and\u00a0yes they are, as i build them copying InPlace the wall and scale it.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/irXjnN9QuLJj8s8HuOsJr-*RDDdbL4PsgFY7u5643-JlBYaKcPnVUcHYXAblEsZlkaNigbyxBh7yOn2vKB0PAMah-zYSAD46/2.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/irXjnN9QuLJj8s8HuOsJr-*RDDdbL4PsgFY7u5643-JlBYaKcPnVUcHYXAblEsZlkaNigbyxBh7yOn2vKB0PAMah-zYSAD46/2.JPG)\n\nbut, as you can see, for some windows i get no result, and, according to the LabelZoneSurfaces component, those windows are not counted as\u00a0Radiance Material.\n\nWhat should i do? What is the problem?\n\nLet me know if you need the rhino and gh files.\n\n\u00a0\n\nN.B. (I can\u00b4t find the way to reply to my discussion so i\u00b4m writing a new one, hope it is\u00a0no a problem)\u00a0\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "December 18, 2015 at 2:03am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Honeybee: Daylight - Radiance Material problem", "replies": [{"body": "\nClaudia,\n\nAttaching the files would be helpful ...\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 18, 2015 at 7:01am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nhere are the files, hopes\u00a0you\u00b4ll find\u00a0a solution.\n\nThanks a lot\u00a0in advance\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1423383", "name": "Floor.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1423384", "name": "Floor.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "December 18, 2015 at 7:15am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nOK Claudia. I think we are almost there.\n\nThe problem, for what i checked is related to the tolerance of the Rhino file.\n\nI set it to 0.1 (see attached) and almost all of the windows are now imported correctly into GH.\n\nThere are 3 windows at the north facade that i don't succeed, but i suggest you to straighten the walls there to get them also. Those walls are very small and i don't believe they will affect the results if you make the wall straight.\n\nI also changed there some normal directions of windows, just for consistency.\n\nThe GH remained almost unchanged, but i did add some previews for the HB_Zones and changed the order of the components for the insertion of the windows into the zones.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1423520", "name": "Floor_AY.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1423521", "name": "Floor_AY.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 18, 2015 at 9:09am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThanks\u00a0 a lot for your reply! It was extremely useful!\n\nAs you said i\u00b4ve straighted the wall and now everything seems to work!!\n\nI have the last question: could you tell me the tollerance of gh and these plugins? or is it the same of rhino? Because\u00a0i know you change\u00a0it in\u00a0rhino, but maybe gh needs different precision than rhino.
