{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI try to create the ASHRAE 90.1 Baseline system 7 with Honeybee openstudio. I found that the Maximum air flow rate for variable volume fan in the air loop is hard sized and the maximum air flow rate in the terminal box is hard sized as well (See images).\n\n\n\nThey should be auto sized and the hard-sized values will significantly under estimate the building energy use and cause long hours of unmet load hours.\n\n\n\nDoes any one know how to fix this issue in the honeybee ?\n\n\n\nThank you very much.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4nNzEYyE*G3mTnexY2L8TNcJKIaw6TR4*y9YJVE56M0NM-aXdR8Ix1zsJNi9-3fNbdvGhiohQeeCgtk57UrY5F2haT80yG98/Untitled1.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4nNzEYyE*G3mTnexY2L8TNcJKIaw6TR4*y9YJVE56M0NM-aXdR8Ix1zsJNi9-3fNbdvGhiohQeeCgtk57UrY5F2haT80yG98/Untitled1.png)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4nNzEYyE*G2Gh52OpMqN7hSY5PT9fcNebA*ULclUhgWIKDZJWkP4cgBoPdWQ1OLI9mavSsxi-xFZRcxDbRrS183dbQLnhRRN/Untitled.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4nNzEYyE*G2Gh52OpMqN7hSY5PT9fcNebA*ULclUhgWIKDZJWkP4cgBoPdWQ1OLI9mavSsxi-xFZRcxDbRrS183dbQLnhRRN/Untitled.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bo Lin", "created_at": "April 20, 2016 at 12:07pm", "created_by": "BL", "topic": "Honeybee Openstudio Baseline System 7 Bug", "replies": [{"body": "\nBao,\n\nIf you upload your GH file, I can verify the exact cause but I believe this is happening because you have set the reciurculatedAirPerArea_ on the \"Set EnergyPlus Zone Loads\" component to a value other than 0.\u00a0 By default, the \"Autosize\" feature on EnergyPlus/OpenStudio will only size the VAV system to deal with thermal loads and so it usually sizes the system to be too small to handle the required recirculated air for programs like hospital patient rooms.\u00a0 For this reason, I built in a hard-sizing capability whenever you specify a non-zero reciurculatedAirPerArea_.\u00a0 If you just set this recirculatedAir value to 0, you will get the default, Autosize capability like in the attached file:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ssLxNXwJhIwdu50K-XQjVQYoAOt0FoIGvYH0vcrU1xIVwshn2XEhj1pKYcjavHji2DagsChT4U5bs0tbeaCWF-u6M-PETOAA/CorrectSizing.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ssLxNXwJhIwdu50K-XQjVQYoAOt0FoIGvYH0vcrU1xIVwshn2XEhj1pKYcjavHji2DagsChT4U5bs0tbeaCWF-u6M-PETOAA/CorrectSizing.JPG)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1512496", "name": "Correct_Sizing.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 20, 2016 at 4:15pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris, I followed your file and re-create the OS file, the air loop fan and terminal air flow rate are still hard sized.
