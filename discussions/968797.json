It is not the actual house I'm desinging, but a cube volume with rectangular windows, just to show proof of the value in september being higher then the one in June.\n\nThank you so much for taking a look.

I checked yours and my local for comparisson. If you see the detail data you'll notice so big differences in radiation data from one day to the other in the same month. The 21th is equinox but in your case the data for june is not the \"best\" from the \"logic\" point of view. Pick 28 and you'll fill better.\n\nAttached\u00a0 a file with WeatherAnalysis also from Ladybug. I selected one day and some hours for June and September. Play with it and you'll see what i mean. Anyway the radiation differences between both months is not very big.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A969114", "name": "WeatherAnalysis_TMP.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 5, 2013 at 2:36pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nAbraham,\u00a0\n\nThanks for your response and your right that the equinox is not the \"best\" or warmest day of the month. It just struck me that the value on September 22th was more than double the value on June 21th. But then taking a closer look, June has their warmer days in the beginning of the month and September in the end. So comparing just one day is gives a warped image.\u00a0\n\nTake a look a the image below\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/HfUvPSttO0I4A*uad2LT9jZ2Kf1MtfwupWjODcX39Fj5uaHSWPCzZmzLlGDA*2iurEgf3WWN0eYWjiGlR9atE8Pv310f9exl/rslts.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/HfUvPSttO0I4A*uad2LT9jZ2Kf1MtfwupWjODcX39Fj5uaHSWPCzZmzLlGDA*2iurEgf3WWN0eYWjiGlR9atE8Pv310f9exl/rslts.jpg)Taking the average radiation value of the whole month is more or less the same for both months like you said.\n\nThanks for clearing this up and thanks for your help!\n\nCheers!\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Arie-Willem de Jongh", "created_at": "December 6, 2013 at 11:25am", "created_by": "aw", "replies": []}]}
