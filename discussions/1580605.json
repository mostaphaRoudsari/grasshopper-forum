making steam, turning a turbine, turning a generator - there are significant energy losses. \u00a0This difference in exergy is also evident in the fact that there are so many more things that I can do directly with a unit of electricity than I can do with the same unit of fuel energy. \u00a0I can use electricity to directly refrigerate, produce light energy or power a motor just as easily as I can use to to cook, produce hot water, or heat a space. \u00a0While I can cook, make hot water, or heat a space directly with fuel energy, refrigeration and lighting are much more difficult. \u00a0For this reason, I do not feel comfortable adding electricity and fuel together either in the totalThermalLoad output or in a site EUI metric.\n\n\n\nStill, the use of site EUI has become so ingrained in the industry that I have to acknowledge it and at least show users how it's calculated. \u00a0In my view, it's an ad-hoc metric that was invented to deal with previously limited amount of information on energy sources.\n\n\n\nInstead of using site EUI, I would recommend using the following metrics depending on what you are trying to evaluate:\n\n**Utility Cost / Square Meter** - to measure the monetary value of a building to an owner or user\n\n**Kg CO2 / Square Meter** - to measure the environmental and climatic impact of a building\n\n**Emergy / Square Meter** - to measure the overall thermodynamic performance of a building\n\n\n\nThe first two are actually fairly easy to calculate these days just by researching your site's utility rates or grid energy mixture and multiplying the building electricity or fuel by their respective rates. \u00a0I will add in some capabilities to Honeybee soon to make it even easier for you to get these values from your EPW file and databases of utility rates/grid mixture. \u00a0Emergy is much harder to calculate as you have to trace all your energy sources all of the way back to the sun but there are a number of experts at work to make this calculation possible (probably in the next few years, we may have much easier ways to calculate it).\n\n\n\nHope this helps explain the current setup.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1581318", "name": "Hourly EUI.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 13, 2016 at 3:01pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for the detailed clarification!\n\n\n\nI agree that Ideal Loads Air System is useful in estimating cooling and heating loads, and help to identify problematic areas in the design that may need to be improved.
