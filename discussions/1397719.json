{"body": "\nHi, I'm not much familiar with Honeybee and I'm having some trouble with Honeybee energy simulation.\n\nI can't get any data from Honeybee_Read EP Result component for simulating a cylinder form. How can I fix it?\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/13SlHjEdb8M7siNJ8wgEZpJH*6qutrnDF8jEwOXhfeKgzELgbelMCHzb3IEu**uYce*7vunRyBiQjQEt1Z-nr*S3qpKdWhiC/Untitled.jpg\" width=\"667\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/13SlHjEdb8M7siNJ8wgEZpJH*6qutrnDF8jEwOXhfeKgzELgbelMCHzb3IEu**uYce*7vunRyBiQjQEt1Z-nr*S3qpKdWhiC/Untitled.jpg)\n\n\n\nAnd one more thing, In what order the mass is divided into different zones? How can I understand each zone number is representing which part of the building?\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Farnoosh Namdarpour", "created_at": "November 10, 2015 at 8:10am", "created_by": "FarnooshNamdarpour", "topic": "Cylinder Energy Simulation and HBZones", "replies": [{"body": "\n1. You need to check errors and warnings from the report output to see what's happening with your model.\n\n2. I suggest to change your cylinder building to a a polygon based extrusion. That will save you a good amount of simulation time.\n\n3. I'm not clear about last part of your question. In general you can use lableZones to see zone attributes ([https://mostapharoudsari.gitbooks.io/honeybee-primer/content/text/c...](https://mostapharoudsari.gitbooks.io/honeybee-primer/content/text/components/Label_Zones.html))\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 10, 2015 at 12:39pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nFarnoosh,\n\nAn example file always helps us understand what issues you are having. \u00a0It may also be that you are not requesting any zone-level outputs for the simulation.\n\nAlso, while HB can simulate curved geometry, it will usually take almost 10% time to run the simulation if you planarize it first.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 11, 2015 at 3:18pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nActually I watched your Ladybug tutorial videos on youtube and I used the example file in\u00a0Ladybug Comfort Tutorials - Indoor Comfort PMV video.
