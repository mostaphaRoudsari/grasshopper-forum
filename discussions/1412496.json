For testing can you manually remove *.amb file from the folder before running a new analysis? The cached .amb data might be the reason.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 11, 2015 at 10:44am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}]}
