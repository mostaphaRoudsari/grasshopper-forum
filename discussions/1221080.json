{"body": "\nHello guys,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if it is possible to calculate the area of a space (e.g. a room) that conforms with a minimum daylight factor.\n\n\n\nI have done a simple daylight simulation, much like the one Mostapha shows in his example of parametric daylight analysis, but apart from visualizing the result grid for every case I would like to calculate the area that is below the minimum Illuminance selected in the legend parameters of the recolour mesh.\n\n\n\nAny ideas how I could do that?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 9, 2015 at 5:22am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Calculate DF% per area", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\n\n\nI would try to turn the mesh into a Brep and calculate the surface this way.
