This is because of a downloading issue that we are facing recently. Please follow the instruction below and it should be fixed. Let me know if you have any other questions. -Mostapha\n\nIf you are experiencing any issues with downloading gendaymtx, OpenStudio libraries and other Ladybug and Honeybee files, you can download all the files from this link as a .zip file and manually extract it to Ladybug folder: ([https://app.box.com/s/bh9sbpgajdtmmystv3n4](https://app.box.com/s/bh9sbpgajdtmmystv3n4)).\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/E6-J*b1OZQNBtTaSA3kYA2ewgPl6XjGBtPPN1DFr6sGQegB8g*jtT5NhZSZd9PomumShRAF3ji1W90FBgF8MuhWG1e-lOz6m/ladybug_defaultFolder.png\" width=\"603\"/>](http://api.ning.com/files/E6-J*b1OZQNBtTaSA3kYA2ewgPl6XjGBtPPN1DFr6sGQegB8g*jtT5NhZSZd9PomumShRAF3ji1W90FBgF8MuhWG1e-lOz6m/ladybug_defaultFolder.png)\n\nYou can find ladybug default folder by checking the output of Ladybug_Ladybug component.
