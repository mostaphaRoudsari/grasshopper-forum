{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nmy simple office box (adiapatic walls, floors, glass facade) won't run, because of HBgenerators is not defined. Attached you'll find the gh-file and the error-report.

I had a look on further posts with the same problem, but Chris' advice didn't work in my case.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1301606", "name": "HBgeneration.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1301607", "name": "error report.txt"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "June 3, 2015 at 5:59am", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "topic": "HBgenerators is not defined - EP-Materials failing", "replies": [{"body": "\nDaniel,\n\nFind\u00a0 a working file.\n\nA lot of things to fix:\n\nNo material were defined/assigned for the surfaces in your file, so no wonder it didn't find (or i understood something wrong in your comment).

First of all I have to apologise for that file. While I cleaned it up to make it easily readable I was too scrubwoman-like and deleted more than I wanted. Nevertheless, still there is something I simply can't define. If you compare the two gh-files somewhere in the components must be a bug. I reinstalled everything today (gh, LB, HB, rad/daysim/e+) but the older file still doesn't work. I updated the components, copy-pasted yours in a new file from srf-definition on and combined it with my components before. And it runs. Any idea?\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1302716", "name": "150605_SETUP.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1302717", "name": "150606_SETUP.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "June 4, 2015 at 9:06am", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Daniel,\n\nAttached 2 working files. See the \"old\" one (150605). I draw red arrows to point what i've changed. The one that points to the HB_Surface indicates that i flattened the walls and in the panel i defined it as Multiline (this is the more important thing!!). The other 2 arrows indicate that i updated and reinserted those components. I performed an update for the file but there was a need of reinserting those becouse the number of input items changed.\n\nNow both files should work for you.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1302750", "name": "150605_SETUP_AY.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1302751", "name": "150606_SETUP_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 4, 2015 at 10:32am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nthank you very much.
