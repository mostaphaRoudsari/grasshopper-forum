First of all, as Mostapha said, there are a LOT of surfaces with their normals pointing inwards. Those are not small changes in the results. But saying that, i don't understand why you think the results are not making sense. I find them pretty logic. I recommend you to increase the resolution of the analysis grid (you have 4, i set 2, but recommend even smaller). In some cases may be confusing seeing one color supposedly wrong just because the calculation was done on the center of the face. In your case this is clear specially on those \"terraces\" on the north (they are north?) side.\n\nAlso i recommend to show the legend and even more than that to set a fixed scale for the legend so you can have all visuals comparable with the same scale.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-A.\n\n\n\nPS. Mostapha, question for you: For the RealTimeAnalysis component to work well there is need to execute the GenCumulativeSkyMtx for the whole year (analysis period)?

The results completely make sense to me. First of all i suggest to show always the legend so you can see what the colors represent.If you show a summer day (say 21.6) you'll see big differences between the vertical and the inclined planes. The radiation in vertical is much lower than in horizontal or inclined. As for winter (say 21.12) the vertical or slightly inclined (as in your example) the radiation is pretty similar. I hope i understood your points and that this helps.\n\n-A.\n\nPS Mostapha: Another one for you. See the attached. I tried to show the results of the RealTimeRadiation in the surfaces but didn't succeed. The results list is different than the one from the RadiationAnalysis component.
