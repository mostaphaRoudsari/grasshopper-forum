{"body": "\nHello all\n\n\n\nI would like to pick my sensor in a floor plan, which is composed of multiple zones. I used \"Item list\" and picked a number and connected that item to my test points in Annual DL Simulation.\u00a0\n\nI totally understand this process when I had one zone, but now that i am working on multiple zones, I think that I don't have control to pick the middle point in each space. The points change when I change my \"Item\" number, but I cannot pick a specific one for each space.\n\nPlease see the attached graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\u00a0\n\n\n\nladan\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1644989", "name": "HB-Pick Sensor.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1644990", "name": "HB-Pick Sensor_Code.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1644991", "name": "2-SecondEnergySim.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 23, 2016 at 4:06pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "Pick Sensor for Annual DL Analysis in Multiple Zones", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ladan,\n\nYour geometry is not internalized in the attached file.\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "November 25, 2016 at 11:17pm", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 26, 2016 at 9:13am", "created_by": "LillyGD", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nLadan,\n\nWhy do you need to pick a\u00a0sensor point in a floor plan? if I may ask.

I didn't run the analysis but you should be able to run it after adding the weather file and a couple of other components.\n\nBack to your question about picking the points you can either flatten all the points and then pick them using item selector or just pick them by grafting the numbers to match each branch. Try Point List component in Grasshopper to see the item number for each point.\n\nIn the attached example I used a logic to find the closest point to the center of the room.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1647095", "name": "integrated daylight and energy.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 27, 2016 at 5:52pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you Mostapha jan, I will try that tomorrow in the office and let you know if I had any problems.

One of the zones was \"open\". This was becouse a number of windows were duplicated for the same zone. I deleted those windows and now all are closed (see white circled group for this).\n\n2. Was thinking why not to simulate just one point instead of simulating the whole grid and then choosing one of them for the following steps. So i did it getting the center point of each zone.
