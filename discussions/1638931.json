{"body": "\nHey guys,\n\nI am trying to create a shading mask on surface for some bus stop shading devices and I have tried so much but I could not get any result. Every time I put the context into shading mask and shading mask II it will took a long time and grasshopper would crash and would error not responding. I don't know why because I do not have a complicated model. It is just a simple bus stop. It is not like a error message that will be show on. Grasshopper will stop working and will be not responding. Does anybody have any idea what might be the problem? I attached my gh and my rhino file so you can better understand the problem.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1638929", "name": "4'.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1638930", "name": "maskshadow.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mitra Sajjadi", "created_at": "November 13, 2016 at 9:12pm", "created_by": "MitraSajjadi", "topic": "Shading Mask Component does not run!!!", "replies": [{"body": "\nMitra,<br/> I'm pretty sure you are running out of memory.<br/>\nYour model is not so simple (looks like but is not).

Because I have 8 of these models exported from Sketch Up do you have any other suggestion beside creating the models? Because that would take so long. Is there a way in which I can make the model simpler itself?\n\n\n\nBy the way, thank you for your response.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mitra Sajjadi", "created_at": "November 13, 2016 at 10:09pm", "created_by": "MitraSajjadi", "replies": []}, {"body": "\ni'd think creating a roof profile curve and extruding it.

Your context geometry needed to be very simple. I have made a simple polysurface to use as a context in your file. Everything works with that polysurface. One more thing. As I was testing the polysurface, I noted that the Ladybug_Shading Mask_II was not outputting anything from maskedSkyDome. I went ahead and fixed that in the component, so for now, it will work fo you. I will also share the same issue with masters to fix this in a permanent manner.\n\n\n\nDevang\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1638863", "name": "4.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1638864", "name": "maskshadow.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1638865", "name": "Shading Masks.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "November 14, 2016 at 2:48am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "\nHey Devang,\n\n\n\nThank you so much for your help.
