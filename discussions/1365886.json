I think I answer most of your questions in this video ([https://youtu.be/Fegs8XGhgpk?list=PLkjfDmSc5OryXkWSt57ltJFU4qXD5ss1v](https://youtu.be/Fegs8XGhgpk?list=PLkjfDmSc5OryXkWSt57ltJFU4qXD5ss1v)) In short\u00a0Climate based sky is using epw weather file to generate the sky but CIE skies are standard models (See [this file](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16228160/Daysim3.0.Tutorial.pdf)\u00a0page 19 and 20). Average sky is a climate based sky that averages the values for each hour during the month, and it's useful to get a sense about the sky condition.\n\n\n\n2. If you google for CIE sky and Radiance you will find several discussions. Some of them like sunny without sun are made for very particular uses. Read Greg's post [here](https://unmethours.com/question/11142/why-is-the-groundglow-from-intermediate-sky-and-sunny-sky-without-sun-so-different-from-that-on-a-physical-ground/?comment=11180#comment-11180).\n\n\n\n3. Yes. If you check the output of the component you can see the file path.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3FLLVGZOVWJlcj0NOon97iJ6ZOcjuGLAKHCwQ0KWVrZ5fDtoWxPXmq1zAFPGp*3QcxNWdBjnBGLk4vivjdm1Me*zvUWrm1kv/filePath.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3FLLVGZOVWJlcj0NOon97iJ6ZOcjuGLAKHCwQ0KWVrZ5fDtoWxPXmq1zAFPGp*3QcxNWdBjnBGLk4vivjdm1Me*zvUWrm1kv/filePath.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 22, 2015 at 6:50pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks a lot Mostafa\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "sajad shahin", "created_at": "September 24, 2015 at 12:09pm", "created_by": "sajadshahin", "replies": []}]}]}
