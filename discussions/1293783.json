Simple radiance materials are usually of the format ... void plastic box 0 0 5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.1 . So everything after the 'box' is a number and the code works fine.\n\n\n\nIf you have a complex materials with terms like 'grand_dx' 'gran_dy' etc, the Honeybee code will crash as it tries to convert text to numbers. However, I think there should be a workaround.
