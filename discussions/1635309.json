{"body": "\nI'm working with the Run Energy Simulation component in Honeybee, and when I set the Boolean toggle to 'true' for both _writeIDF and runEnergyPlus_ inputs, I get no response. The component does nothing and stays orange. I have EnergyPlus installed on my system. In fact, the Honeybee_Honeybee component only gives me OpenStudio errors.\n\n\n\nAny ideas what's wrong and how to fix this? See attached screenshot. Thank you so much for your response and feedback.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1635308", "name": "EnergySimulation.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Sarah", "created_at": "November 8, 2016 at 3:39pm", "created_by": "Sarah854", "topic": "HoneyBee-RunEnergy Simulation _WRITE IDF ERROR", "replies": [{"body": "\nHard to say Sarah.\n\nMore useful uploading the file.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 8, 2016 at 9:42pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}], "id": "1635309"}
