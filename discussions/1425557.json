{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nI've always had good luck here, so I'll try another one.\n\nI\u00b4m trying to run a daylight simulation and optimization considering some shading surfaces designed in Rhino and i\u00b4m using the \"HoneyBee EP context Surfaces\" component.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/jCEO2AQNowcgZn*mEVSFR2vfx87sDpCcS1PZEsjERkrrKM-KyTGZBAjVtNal1GBjxo76*jmNY*ehNbV98u*HUpAVHHVmdnD4/1.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/jCEO2AQNowcgZn*mEVSFR2vfx87sDpCcS1PZEsjERkrrKM-KyTGZBAjVtNal1GBjxo76*jmNY*ehNbV98u*HUpAVHHVmdnD4/1.JPG)\n\nAs you can see the problem is that my \"shading surfaces\" in input are trimmed and untrimmed surfaces, because for my optimization i want them to rotate and to change their depths, but that makes the error in the \"HoneyBee EP context Surfaces\" component (error:\u00a0**\"NoneType\" object has no attribute \"faces\"**), while if i had referenced brep in input i wouldn\u00b4t have any problem.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/jCEO2AQNowej2LThTyW*y1O2rAzcLmia*RHkHKXfCPly25gHmLIsHh6kSlb75bYEl535sgUCxrFGJd7uq*yrut4F8oH2DM8k/2.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/jCEO2AQNowej2LThTyW*y1O2rAzcLmia*RHkHKXfCPly25gHmLIsHh6kSlb75bYEl535sgUCxrFGJd7uq*yrut4F8oH2DM8k/2.JPG)\n\n\n\nWhat should i do if i want to maintain all the geometry changes?\n\nThanks in advanced\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "December 23, 2015 at 6:49am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "HoneyBee EP context Surfaces_(Un)Trimmed surfaces problem", "replies": [{"body": "\nClaudia,\n\nYour luck chances will increase if you attach the example file :-)\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 23, 2015 at 7:18am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Abraham!\n\nHere there are the files.\u00a0\n\nI\u00b4ve just started with these plugins and programs so i\u00b4m really sorry if i often ask something here..
