{"body": "\nHi everyone.\n\nI was wondering whether it would be possible to calculate only one output of a component in Ladybug.\n\nI would like to optimize the orientation of a panel with Galapagos, where the:\n\n- Genome = Panel Orientation\u00a0\n\n- Fitness = ACenergyPerYear\n\nThis is running very slowly and I was thus wondering if all the other outputs of the Photovoltaics Surface could be disabled to make it run faster. Any other suggestions are welcome as well.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0N6V1bax3FM0aY6-6QskfFb7If*QNgXvfD4wZkzUExMhNjyTfNG30XZXT6hAna1k4ETeP3KPZV4nmBOOpBmVixtudKMpkDRC/Capture14.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0N6V1bax3FM0aY6-6QskfFb7If*QNgXvfD4wZkzUExMhNjyTfNG30XZXT6hAna1k4ETeP3KPZV4nmBOOpBmVixtudKMpkDRC/Capture14.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erik Pelicaen", "created_at": "July 8, 2016 at 4:38am", "created_by": "ErikPelicaen", "topic": "Ladybug Simplify Component Calculation", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Erik,<br/><br/>You can not choose which component outputs will be calculated and which not.<br/>You can see in this\u00a0[video where optimal tilt-azimuth is being searched with Galapagos](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/video/annual-optimal-tilt-and-azimuth-angle-of-an-unshaded-pv-array) that the speed is also slow. I speeded up the framerate 40 times. If I remember correctly the Galapagos was working for a couple of hours. In your case it may work less as you only have one slider connected to the **Genome** input.<br/><br/>This is one of the reasons why TOF component should be used, instead.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 8, 2016 at 4:48am", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": [{"body": "\nOK thank you djordje I will keep that in mind.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erik Pelicaen", "created_at": "July 11, 2016 at 8:36am", "created_by": "ErikPelicaen", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1561998"}
