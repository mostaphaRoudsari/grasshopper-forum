{"body": "\nHello everyone,<br/><br/>I'm trying to get the average yearly sunVector for a hour a month.\u00a0\n\n<br/>e.g. the average monthly sunVector at 13:00 for 2015 is x \u00b0,\u00a0<br/>sadly i'm not getting the data sorted the way i want it. Becouse\u00a0\n\ni can't use the partition tool since for diffrent days there are\n\ndiffrent amounts of hours of sun. eg 1 januari from 8:00 to 16:00\n\nand 1 februari from 8:00 to 18:00. Wich is making the information\n\nin the list very hard to handle.<br/><br/>So can anyone help me find the average yearly sunvector for every hour\n\nfor each month\n\n\n\nfor example<br/><br/>\n\navg sunvector for the whole of\u00a0**januari**<br/>1:00, \u00a0avg sunvector (the avareages of all sunvectors at 1:00 in januari)<br/>2:00 , avg sunvector<br/>3:00 , avg\u00a0sunvector<br/>untill<br/>24:00, sunvector temp<br/>avg for the whole of\u00a0**februari**<br/>1:00, \u00a0avg\u00a0sunvector<br/>2:00 , avg sunvector\u00a0(the avareages of all sunvectors at 2:00 in februari)<br/>3:00 , avg\u00a0sunvector<br/>untill<br/>24:00, avg\u00a0sunvector<br/><br/>and this for every month of the year.\n\n\n\nI want to be able to optimize a surface wich is divided into multiple meshes (so for each part of the surface i want to relate it's normal to the vector of the sun). I'm not so much interested in the visualisations. I hope this is atleast abit understandable.<br/><br/>**ps: this question is atleast abit simular to my previous question on wich i got some really good help, wich i'm very gratefull for.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n<br/>Thanks in advance!<br/><br/><br/>Included: gh file + the epw file i'm using\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1417860", "name": "NLD_Amsterdam.062400_IWEC.epw"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1417861", "name": "LADYBUG AVG monthly,hourly data,solar vector.gh"}], "created_by_name": "cyyo", "created_at": "December 9, 2015 at 7:56am", "created_by": "cyyo", "topic": "Problem: Yearly average sun vector / hour", "replies": [{"body": "\nYou should look at this [discussion.](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/problem-yearly-average-temperature-hour)\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 9, 2015 at 8:08am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\n[This discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/sunlight-hours-analysis-output?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1405375&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\u00a0should also help for separating data.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 9, 2015 at 8:43am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nI think you\u00a0might be\u00a0making\u00a0the problem more complicated than it needs to be.
