{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI am a beginner in Grasshopper and Ladybug and Honeybee that are really nice plugins. Now, I face some problems when I tried these files.\n\nQuestion 1_For the 004_gridBasedAnalysis (old version):\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What is the source of length of the results?\n\nQuestion 1_2_For the 004_gridBasedAnalysis (new version):\n\nThe result would change when I changed the opening ratio in step 7, but it would not change when lower or higher the opening ratio in step 6. Therefore, I am confused of the work of index for opening ratio in step 6.\u00a0\n\nQuestion 2 _For illuminanceAnalysis\n\nI would like to attach customized geometry for window, so I tried this file.\n\nQuestion 3_For Shading for daylighting\n\nAbove all, I would like to analyze different geometry of fenestration systems, such as special louvers or perforated screens, so I would like to attach those complex geometry to daylight analysis. When I went through the workshop video on youtube, I guess those analysis is mainly based on glazing, so I am still confused that how I can connect different geometry of fenestration to Ladybug and Honeybee. Is there any example file that shows analysis of perforated screen or similar design?\n\nThank you so much for your reply.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1143722", "name": "Question files.zip"}], "created_by_name": "HUI-LING CHANG", "created_at": "October 6, 2014 at 12:50am", "created_by": "HUILINGCHANG", "topic": "Questions for gridBasedAnalysis, illuminanceAnalysis and Shading for daylighting files", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Hui-ling,\n\nI can see that Chris has already answered to a number of your questions in an email. Can you update me here that which questions are still valid? Also I suggest to post your questions one by one as it will be much easier to help.\n\nAlso please update your components to the latest version. That may solve couple of issues that you have here.\n\nBack to your question about fenestration, if it is a regular perforated screen then you can use mixedFunctions, otherwise you can just create the geometry as a brep and put it in front of the window. Are they dynamic or just fixed shadings?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 6, 2014 at 8:59pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\n\n\nThank you for your reply.

In step 7 you are reading the results form the folder. Step 6 is for running the analysis. In step 7 you make the decision about which part of the result do you want to read from. If you get the results from runDaylightAnalysis component then the results will match to your sliders in number 6.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 7, 2014 at 4:30pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n2-1.

The component will return the results itself and you don't need to use readRADResults component.\n\n\n\n3-2) In daylighting simulation RADIANCE doesn't know if the object is a shading or is a wall. All it cares about is the geometry and the assigned material. You can model your shadings as you want as Breps and then pass them through HBSurface, apply desired RADMaterial and add it to the scene. Does it make sense?\n\n\n\n3-3) It is possible. Check advanced example for daylighting simulation -007 ([https://app.box.com/s/znns0dtewd1tclicx74q](https://app.box.com/s/znns0dtewd1tclicx74q)). My suggestion is to spend more time getting yourself comfortable with Grasshopper and Honeybee with simpler examples before jumping to advanced examples.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 7, 2014 at 4:43pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4hNukqhfhE2i3FJuBuN0j*5koAMne3NX1bg7eHVEA55ahf*SkbRrWNPqSpgEUTOqAeCJZoHJEaW8Tetv7tUNs-PMXoEWfSN*/question4_2.png)\n\n4-1) As I mentioned in question 3 any shape will be fine, connected or disconnected.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4hNukqhfhE2i3FJuBuN0j*5koAMne3NX1bg7eHVEA55ahf*SkbRrWNPqSpgEUTOqAeCJZoHJEaW8Tetv7tUNs-PMXoEWfSN*/question4_2.png\" width=\"707\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4hNukqhfhE2i3FJuBuN0j*5koAMne3NX1bg7eHVEA55ahf*SkbRrWNPqSpgEUTOqAeCJZoHJEaW8Tetv7tUNs-PMXoEWfSN*/question4_2.png)4-2) The warning is fine as far as you don't see many of them.
