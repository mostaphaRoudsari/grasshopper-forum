In your case the top one is giving OpenBrep and the bottom one is giving UntrimmedZone. In the bottom it is probably causd becouse you are using the same geometry for the base surface abd for the child surface. Can't be!! The child surface MUST be at least, slightly smaller than the base surface (that's why it is a child).\n\nFor each zone you should think as a box. For example, the top one should be about 6 zones because of the internal floors.\n\nIn short, you have some modeling work to do in order to fix your file.\n\nIf your geometry if fixed i would thing about a different modeling strategy. Probably with masses, masses2zones, etc.\n\nNot very helpful but ...\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 8, 2016 at 4:34am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}]}]}
