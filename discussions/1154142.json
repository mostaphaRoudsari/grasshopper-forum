Are you sure that first download was successful? The file that Ladybug downloads is the same file as what you get in Radiance. Just to make sure I updated the file again. I also added a new check to the component so in case Radiance is already installed it copies the file from Radiance folder instead of downloading it.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 22, 2014 at 6:15pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nfor some reason it use to download a version of gendaymtx.exe that was only 1Ko!
