{"body": "\nIn using Mostapha's [Integrated Daylight and Energy file](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Integrated_Daylight_and_Energy_simulation&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=8&amp;offset=-3658.8616705976265,-2128.1713822547777), I noticed a discrepancy in the lighting profile that is created with the ReadAnnualResult component. I compared the original lighting schedule, which has a 0.2 - 0.5 lighting fraction in the evenings with the generated profile, which has a 1.0 lighting fraction in the evenings.\n\n\n\nI'm guessing that this component assumes lighting is 100% required if the lighting fraction is greater than 0.2 and if daylight isn't sufficient. However, I would prefer that if daylight isn't sufficient, the continuous (not binary) lighting fraction is taken from the original schedule.\n\nDoes anyone know how to essentially merge these schedules? I think I could do this by exporting to excel, using a couple excel formulas and re-importing, but I would prefer to stick in Grasshopper.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBelow is the image of the Office::OpenOffice occupancy schedule, the generated lighting annual profile, and the Office::OpenOffice lighting schedule. I've circled the area in the evening where I'd expect/prefer the generated lighting profile to have a fraction similar to the original lighting schedule.\u00a0[<br/><img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KtdNBL2ZfJA8GJSPKW5e1uiZRBst*eFi5zTLGdEgstRArRlobcHQgvnQwRb5TREyP10Jl0T4v9ucI3YcC3ou0YaznmUac7HK/ScheduleDiscrepancy.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KtdNBL2ZfJA8GJSPKW5e1uiZRBst*eFi5zTLGdEgstRArRlobcHQgvnQwRb5TREyP10Jl0T4v9ucI3YcC3ou0YaznmUac7HK/ScheduleDiscrepancy.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lizzie Adams", "created_at": "February 26, 2016 at 7:03pm", "created_by": "LizzieAdams", "topic": "Annual Profiles - lighting fraction is higher than original schedule fraction", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Lizzie,\n\n\n\nThere are two different topics in your your question. I answer the second one first.\n\nYou can manipulate the values by merging the lists of numbers and use Honeybee_Create CSV Schedule to write them to a file all inside Grasshopper.\n\n\n\nBack the first topic it uses Daysim to calculate the schedule and daysim doesn't accept partial occupancy so we have to convert the partial occupancy in EnergyPlus to zero and ones in Daysim. The good news is that you can manage the numbers as you wish by using the method that I mentioned earlier.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 29, 2016 at 6:56am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}], "id": "1472714"}
