{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI ran into an issue with the\u00a0updateLadybug v0.0.64 and updateHoneybee v0.0.61 components and figured I'd share the problem/solution. Don't attach a boolean toggle to the updateLadybug components! it will spin forever and force you to MOAB Rhino. Use a button instead and everything will work fine.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/6AU-dFpd9S487edK8HJ3leSRpcDUlwRIBpPAqdkfeYJge1VZ8O6IZIIgZfgL4QnjERlS6LRU2l*TtCzenMmbv9el3U071OPN/HBupdate3.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/6AU-dFpd9S487edK8HJ3leSRpcDUlwRIBpPAqdkfeYJge1VZ8O6IZIIgZfgL4QnjERlS6LRU2l*TtCzenMmbv9el3U071OPN/HBupdate3.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 4:17pm", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "topic": "Trouble with updateLadybug v0.0.64 and updateHoneybee v0.0.61", "replies": [{"body": "\nLeland,\n\nI'm not sure why you have to use a button but the boolean toggle still works fine on my end.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 11, 2017 at 2:16pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks for responding Chris, I'm happy to hear\u00a0my glitch isn't a problem for everyone.
