So it's more probable to have situations of discomfort with this assumptions.<br/>In fact, the high wind can decrease the sensation of discomfort during the summer as well as low levels of humidity.<br/>Besides this check one can see where there are shaded zones. So, it's possible to check the results using \"comfort in shade\" method.<br/>**1 AGO 14:00**\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zRe4LlmRG6amACzxPG3YI1TA*NqoiPH7FLzeImjqnrIo1m*8OvZc3-bKYQ8PRL8S0DRhfkT6NfDwLE4ALRSvOrTApJtJ5Ww8/Canvasat003351.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zRe4LlmRG6amACzxPG3YI1TA*NqoiPH7FLzeImjqnrIo1m*8OvZc3-bKYQ8PRL8S0DRhfkT6NfDwLE4ALRSvOrTApJtJ5Ww8/Canvasat003351.png)\n\nIf you compare the image above with yours , you'll see that the yellow areas overlap the shaded zones.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zRe4LlmRG6YJSBNW4SkrmpM*kb9rvZlJrptcyL4-1MbKqn-FhaPGuY-qtOiUCdXGwNNK1E5FMrc-dgEzIK56yQoIU4lTI8Lz/Demostration_01.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zRe4LlmRG6YJSBNW4SkrmpM*kb9rvZlJrptcyL4-1MbKqn-FhaPGuY-qtOiUCdXGwNNK1E5FMrc-dgEzIK56yQoIU4lTI8Lz/Demostration_01.png)\n\n\n\nBests\n\nAntonello\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "January 23, 2016 at 5:19pm", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you very much, Antonello, for your detailed explanation!\n\n\n\nI now have a better understanding of the rationale behind the microclimate mapping component.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "January 23, 2016 at 9:47pm", "created_by": "Grasshope", "replies": []}]}]}
