{"body": "\nHi EveryOne,\n\n\n\nNew to LadyBug I was using DIVA before and I though I'll give the Lady a try.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI was wondering if radiation component will work on a 2d surface. Right now I try it with 2d surface (imagine a ground plane) and an solid model of that ground. Right now only the solid model will display the proper radiation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIs this right? that 2d surfaces won't work on ladybug radiation component\n\n\u00a0\n\nthank you all\n\n\u00a0\n\ncheers\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "April 7, 2014 at 11:48am", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "radiation analysis question", "replies": [{"body": "\nProbably you need to check the normal direction of the surface and reverse if needed.
