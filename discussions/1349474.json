E+ accepts so many silly things that you can't imagine. But i won't rely in the results. This possibility will become completely impredictable.

It just gives you a warning. The material will be kept as it is. An alternate solution is to apply a custom material to light-shelf.\n\n\n\nI haven't opened your file but if you're trying to model a light-shelf the best practice is to run an annual daylight analysis with Daysim and connect the schedule to energyplus while having the light-shelf component as a shading object in Energy simulation.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 28, 2015 at 2:12am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks Abraham and Mostafa,\n\nI got it.\n\nProblem solved!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Fahimeh Motazedian", "created_at": "August 29, 2015 at 12:22pm", "created_by": "FahimehMotazedian", "replies": []}]}]}
