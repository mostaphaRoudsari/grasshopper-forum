{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,<br/><br/>I'm doing a final project degree about a portable work space, and want to choose the final shape of the roof from radiation analysis. My roof works upon the selection of a gantry which has three ranging points Y and X.\n\n<br/>What I thought would play a radiation analysis on the object and then make an analysis of the results from each roof format using the Galapagos.\n\n<br/>So, Galapagos recognize every chance roof shape and make a link with the outcome of radiation study and would like the result, the format that allows me to take over the roof to the use of solar panels.\n\n<br/>I discovered LadyBug few days ago and am trying to understand it as quickly as possible, because I have only a few months to finish my work.<br/><br/>Have you any idea how I can do it efficiently?<br/>I have started to do some tests using the examples files, but do not know how to link with the Galapagos.<br/><br/>Congratulations for your work and thank you very much for your help\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1307247", "name": "HUB_lady bug - radiance.gh"}], "created_by_name": "rebeca duque estrada", "created_at": "June 10, 2015 at 5:51pm", "created_by": "rebecaduqueestrada", "topic": "How to use LadyBug_Radiation and Galapagos for a roof study", "replies": [{"body": "\nHello Rebeca,\n\n\n\nConnecting galapagos with Ladybug is quite easy.\n\n\n\nAll you need to do is to connect a number of parameters (e.g. sliders) to galapagos, these will be your genomes. In your case I imagine that the critical variable is the shape of the roof, so you can connect the any number of sliders you are using to define different shapes. Then you should connect the result of your radiation analysis to the fitness input of galapagos. Double click on galapagos and run the simulation (you might want to consider to lower the populations in your first runs).\n\n\n\nFor more into evolutionary optimization galapagos has a number of documents you can go over.\n\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "June 10, 2015 at 9:15pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nTheodore said it all.
