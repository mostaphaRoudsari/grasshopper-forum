As far as I know, the heat island effect is amplified during the night. So the morphed file should never contain temperatures below the original one.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDo you have any idea why this might be the case here?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "ipek", "created_at": "March 29, 2017 at 2:53pm", "created_by": "IpekGursel", "topic": "dragonfly UHI temperature different", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ipek,\n\nA -10C difference is very odd and I can't think of any explanation off the bat. \u00a0What EPW are you using and are you changing the city parameters at all from the example file? \u00a0If so, upload a GH file and we can check it.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 29, 2017 at 3:54pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nH\u0131 Chris,\n\n\n\nI am attaching the gh file here.
