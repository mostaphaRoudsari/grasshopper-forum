{"body": "\nI wonder if someone has found a way to determine maximum yearly irradiance for a calulation mesh in Ladybug?

Use [Gendaylit](https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/gendaylit.pdf) with the -02 option to create a climate based sky, and then use that sky to do a radiation analysis with ambient calculations turned off (i.e. a -ab 0 run).\n\nDaysim approximates the position of the sun, which can be in as many as unique 3000 locations on an annual basis, [to only 65 odd locations in the sky](http://daysim.ning.com/subprogram/rtracedc).
