{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI'm noticing issues running annual daylight simulations since I updated the file with the latest HB&amp;LB version.\n\nIf from one side the simulation starts without errors, I'm not able to get any illuminance results. Besides, by selecting a RhinoView for DGP purposes, I got DGP values not reliable.\n\n\n\nI hope someone else had the same issue.\n\nI attach the definition so as to be more clear :)\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\nMarco\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1468619", "name": "DaylightSimulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Marco P", "created_at": "February 22, 2016 at 2:17am", "created_by": "MarcoP", "topic": "daylight simulation DGP issue", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Marco,\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if I quite understand the problem.
