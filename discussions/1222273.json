Do you mean that initial radiation should be calculated based on input Rhino geometry or should it somehow try to use the LiDar geometry data that mapDwell does? (Note that it is often difficult to obtain LiDar data outside the US and my experience has taught me that most governments outside the US are not very open with their GIS data).\n\nAlso, it is very difficult to know what the tax credits and cost of panel installation are since it varies a lot from location to location. \u00a0As I understand it these days, for every Watt of PV installed, around $0.80 is for manufacturing and somewhere between $2.20 and $3.20 is for shipping and installation. \u00a0\n\nIf you know of a good global database with good estimators of labor installation costs and tax credits, let us know and we can try to link to it but I feel that Mapdwell would probably be using such a database if it existed.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 11, 2015 at 2:35pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHello Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to look into this once again.\n\n\n\nI want to reply with an example of the potential workflow, but the GenCumulativeSkyMtx is giving me a fatal error so I can t run the GH.\n\n\n\n(I don t mean replicating the Mapdwell, I just reference it as an example of possible assumption inputs regarding costs, type of PV, frame or not, or anything else (I currently lack the knowledge on the subject) that someone would need to vary in order to estimate PV related outputs: returns, payback cycles etc. The input geometry will be our designed in Rhino PV surfaces, with Radiation values calculated from LB).\n\n\n\nAny suggestions for this error?
