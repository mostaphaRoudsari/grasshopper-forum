{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI am wondering what is the default setup for mechanical ventilation when using the Ideal Loads Air System in HB (how is the outdoor air flow rate calculated?).\n\n\n\nThe .idf\u00a0 contains the following:\n\n**DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir,**<br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0zone_1OutdoorAirCntrl,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 !- Name**<br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Sum,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 !- Outdoor Air Method**<br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a00.0,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 !- Outdoor Air Flow per Person {m3/s-person}**<br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a00.0,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 !- Outdoor Air Flow per Zone Floor Area {m3/s-m2}**<br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0, !- Outdoor Air Flow per Zone {m3/s}**<br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0, !- Outdoor Air Flow Air Changes per Hour {1/hr}**<br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0; !- Outdoor Air Flow Rate Fraction Schedule Name**\n\n\n\nWhich made me think there was no outdoor air flow.

So you confirm that default setup for mechanical ventilation is 'no mechanical ventilation' when using the Ideal Lodas Air System in HB ? (Outdoor Air Flow per Person = 0 AND Outdoor Air Flow per Zone Floor Area = 0).\n\n\n\nI still have doubts, because when adding \"Zone sensible Heating Rate\" as output, I get non-null results. (I thought \"Zone Sensible Heating Rate\" was directly related to the Outdoor Air Flow)\n\n\n\nMarc\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marc Lotteau", "created_at": "June 27, 2016 at 12:51am", "created_by": "MarcLotteau", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThe default is not 0.

Output of the \"Set Zone Loads\" component to see your Jones's ventilation specifications.\n\n\n\nSensible heating is pretty much the same as normal heating in an ideal air loads system. It's dependent on ventilation as well as everything else.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 27, 2016 at 6:13am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1551868"}
