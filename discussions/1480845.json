If you specify a system where energy is consumed at the zone-level like Packaged Terminal Heat Pumps (PTHP) or ideal air loads systems, you get a different energy consumption for each zone.\n\nIf you really need a sense of how much each zone is consuming with a VAV system, I could build the capability to get zone-level sensible and latent heating/cooling and output it from the Honeybee-Read EP HVAC Result component.\u00a0 However, it has to be clear to everyone that this energy is not electricity or fuel but just \"the amount of heat added to or removed from the zone.\"\u00a0 In other words, adding up all of the cooling energy of the zones is not going to be equal to the electric energy consumed by the chiller.\n\nLet me know if this makes sense and whether you would use the zone sensible/latent capability if I built it in.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 11, 2016 at 12:01pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThanks Chris,\n\nI understand the concept and the logic behind it, I'm looking to treat each Brep in the array as it's own building, not zone, so i can study the overall impact at the site energy consumption level as it relates to window-wall area ratio and orientation. if there was a way to pass breps as \"buildings\", so you can study different options simultaneously, instead of zones, that'd be awesome...but I understand if this isn't possible.\n\nthanks!\n\n\n\njoel\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Joel Yow", "created_at": "March 11, 2016 at 12:08pm", "created_by": "JoelYow", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nJoel,\n\n\n\nWhat you are asking for is very easy to do thanks to the beautiful simplicity of Grasshopper and Mostapha's brilliance in applying it. \u00a0All that you have to do if you want to assign a separate VAV system to each zone is graft the input into the Honeybee_OpenStudio Systems component like so:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/IReZCGmClNQrSfErr3mzH4PIwKUNhvtgW-4Ve2cvq6lE0HzQenWFvkDDCy8*MsBNTkYHk3nTXSQTf1jbfdHviDlpl80ZVITy/GraftedVAV.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/IReZCGmClNQrSfErr3mzH4PIwKUNhvtgW-4Ve2cvq6lE0HzQenWFvkDDCy8*MsBNTkYHk3nTXSQTf1jbfdHviDlpl80ZVITy/GraftedVAV.JPG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/IReZCGmClNRgn30MgKQiDfuzVBGUZRJENjWdOhWVbknTPKxxZPoOOkxrK0tBYXSobUyCIBEO1lssOH66rzFXp*OVRv69Pkfh/VAV_SingleZone.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/IReZCGmClNRgn30MgKQiDfuzVBGUZRJENjWdOhWVbknTPKxxZPoOOkxrK0tBYXSobUyCIBEO1lssOH66rzFXp*OVRv69Pkfh/VAV_SingleZone.JPG)\n\nBy default, the input into the\u00a0Honeybee_OpenStudio Systems component is flattened so that you get one centralized system like this:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/IReZCGmClNS5kzao1Q1swNMz6unYBsTEW7ijTcwHMJL-Y20OOZSpNv*scJP*Pxc5oQtJq7gINrQyjbSSldqoaimkOaGQg8rO/FlattenedVAV.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/IReZCGmClNS5kzao1Q1swNMz6unYBsTEW7ijTcwHMJL-Y20OOZSpNv*scJP*Pxc5oQtJq7gINrQyjbSSldqoaimkOaGQg8rO/FlattenedVAV.JPG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/IReZCGmClNS04K5lTBdm4K73Zfqji1pWSPYZWWdiqEuECm3Gh*DUwYh9gO-ULrClgseBQhqEYkM2Bd*LJ1oLE4WLsyzeb-3Y/VAV_TwoZone.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/IReZCGmClNS04K5lTBdm4K73Zfqji1pWSPYZWWdiqEuECm3Gh*DUwYh9gO-ULrClgseBQhqEYkM2Bd*LJ1oLE4WLsyzeb-3Y/VAV_TwoZone.JPG)\n\nAs long as your zones are organized in a data tree / grafted list, you can assign separate systems to different groups of zones.\n\n\n\nLet me know if this is clear. \u00a0I remember it took me a good year of working with Grasshopper before I understood data trees and grafting. \u00a0It's a super-useful feature once you get the hang of it.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1482973", "name": "FlatenedZoneGraftedZone.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 12, 2016 at 9:34am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nthanks chris, apologies for the delayed response (didn't get a notification that you posted a response).
