{"body": "\n\n\nHi Mostapha and Chris,\n\n\n\nI realized that somehow we are using similar methods to calculate View Factor.\u00a0 I just did a comparison to see how accurate is LB by considering the sky dome patches as a reference for rays ( as yo said and I'm wondering why!). The way that it distributes points on an unit sphere doesn't seem efficient and it needs huge number of rays to be accurate which is more close to the Monte Carlo method and time consuming process while for a sphere in the middle of a cube using 2500 rays seems more than enough.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, what is not clear for me is do you convert Fp\u2192s to Fs\u2192p to calculate MRT considering how surfaces see the object or a person?\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LzuBkct8RpOkR38S6NO*tWLkxuLXebdwkJiP1c5I3rto80hVB3JAM7IIQuligIIp-TL8FmTKVojuvJGXK07xWGYbcdqY3a3s/VF1.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ltV3bxd57J5aO8AJt94tFTkr1YL4l6IwTYvVni7kdtPvsEUnuaCdTo8AMsqtuD5b*29ARXylvZ3wKuGgi06NBqhC9YNlhqSK/Presentation1.jpg)\n\nThanks,\n\nNavid\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "navid", "created_at": "April 18, 2016 at 6:46am", "created_by": "navidhatefnia", "topic": "View Factor (Fp\u2192s  Vs.
