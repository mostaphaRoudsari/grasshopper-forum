{"body": "\nI've set up an integrated daylighting and building energy model for a number of shading geometries. I was originally running all the calculations through OpenStudio but I was getting unrealistically low transmitted beam energy values. I went to double check these results by plugging in the same HBZones into EnergyPlus and got much more realistic results.\u00a0\n\nI've spend a lot of time adjusting inputs to see if something was throwing off OpenStudio. I use a lot of custom schedules but none should affect transmitted solar energy. I've even tried with no shading devices and still get drastically different results.\u00a0\n\nI have attached my file if that is helpful for debugging. Am I doing something wrong to throw off the results?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1503417", "name": "EnergyVsShadingStudy_forDebugging.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Justin Shultz", "created_at": "April 7, 2016 at 4:56pm", "created_by": "JustinShultz", "topic": "EnergyPlus and OpenStudio Components Giving Different Transmitted Solar Energy", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Justin,\n\nThis sounds like a bug! Thanks for reporting. Have you checked the idf files to see if Honeybee OpenStudio exports Windows materials correctly?\n\nI'll be quite busy until later this week but added this to [github](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/503)\u00a0so I or one of the other developers check this ASAP.\n\nThank you so much for reporting!\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 9, 2016 at 11:35am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}], "id": "1503418"}
