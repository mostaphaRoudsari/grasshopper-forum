{"body": "\nHi Everybody,\n\n\n\n\n\nThe orientation related to North can be set up in \"Honeybee_ Run Energy Simulation\" components, but I do not find how to set up the North orientation for \u201cHBZones\u201d, such as in \"Honeybee_Set EnergyPlus Zone Thresholds\".\n\n\n\nIf I set up the\u00a0North\u00a0orientation in \"Honeybee_ Run Energy Simulation\", but do not (or cannot) set up\u00a0North\u00a0orientation for\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHBZones\u201d, some calculation result will be not correct.\n\n\n\nCan someone help me for this issue.\n\n\n\nSolon.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Solon", "created_at": "February 12, 2017 at 8:55am", "created_by": "w9002", "topic": "Problem of North orientation", "replies": [{"body": "\nJust connect a vector or a number to north input.
