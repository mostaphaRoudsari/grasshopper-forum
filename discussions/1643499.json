I have some questions about the set up:\u00a0\n\n1. When creating the \"PV SystemSize\", how much does the Base Surface matter? What I am seeing is that the output is not dependent on the input surface and it always produces the same PV Surface. Wouldn't I be able to squeeze more PVs on a larger surface and wouldn't that affect the total kWh output? How can I model that? Do I use Number of Rows for that?\u00a0\n\n2. In the \"Photovoltaics Surface\" component. Is DCtoACderateFactor important? Like I mentioned I am looking at desert climate and I think that my default soiling factor will be more in range of 5.5-5.8 rather than standard 2.\u00a0\n\n3. Should I plug North vector into all components? Is that value propagated, or contained in each component?\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "konrad k sobon", "created_at": "November 23, 2016 at 9:39am", "created_by": "konradksobon", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Kondrad\n\n1) There are two types of surfaces that Ladybug Photovoltaics use:<br/>**_PVsurface**\u00a0- this is basically what you've mentioned: a surface which will be populated with PV modules. The larger the surface, the larger the number of modules and system size, there for the higher annual energy generation.<br/>**baseSurface_**\u00a0- this input exists only for \"PV SWH system size\" component. It's purpose is to represent a mounting plane on which the PV modules will be put onto. The dark blue colored roof in the photo below is that mounting surface in this case:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/I3qJw2-zaOEVsGx8tn8yPA7ichtUvbVTHv1zy3T8Cke0iDKXEzU6rJt0pvopLIkYXS*x8XYRXvTtWubkHnkRLDkNB8e1rFvi/baseSurface_.jpg?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/I3qJw2-zaOEVsGx8tn8yPA7ichtUvbVTHv1zy3T8Cke0iDKXEzU6rJt0pvopLIkYXS*x8XYRXvTtWubkHnkRLDkNB8e1rFvi/baseSurface_.jpg)\n\nSo the size of area of the baseSurface_ is not important but its plane.\n\n<br/>2) It is important. It basically sets the initial losses of the system.\n\nIf that is the soiling value you have, then yes, you need to add it to the DC to AC derate factor component, and then plug its output to \"DCtoACderateFactor_\" input. I did that in the attached definition below.\n\n3) The north vector/numeric value is not propagated due to possible independent usage of components.<br/>I plugged the 0 value to all three component's which have \"north_\" input.

This is one of those situation.<br/>\"TOF\" component in general should be used to calculate the TOF and TSRF indices. They show, how \"distant\" is your\u00a0**_PV_SWHsurface** from the optimal\u00a0**_PV_SWHsurface** surface in terms of tilt and azimuth angles.<br/>However, in your case we are not interested in TOF and TSRF indices. We would just like to know what are the\u00a0**_PV_SWHsurface** optimal tilt and azimuth angles, regardless of the supplied\u00a0**_PV_SWHsurface**.\n\nSo the circular surface supplied to the \"TOF\" component's\u00a0**_PV_SWHsurface** input is irrelevant. It can be of any area, and any tilt/azimuth angle.<br/><br/>The **PV_SWHsurfacesArea** output of the\u00a0\"PV SWH system size\" component depends on a couple of factors:<br/>**moduleActiveAreaPercent_** (leave it at 90%).\n\n**moduleEfficiency_**,\n\n**systemSize_**.<br/><br/>Calculation of\u00a0**systemSize_** depends on your electricity demand, cost of the PV system, type of the object, country, local regulations etc. This is something that an engineer needs to determine.<br/>For example, in USA for a residential house in the\u00a0Sunbelt, depending on finances, a household would try to cover 100% of its annual electricity needs with their PV system. Which means that the **systemSize_\u00a0**you chose needs to cover the annual electricity consumption. You can perform EnergyPlus simulation or use any other way to get the annual electricity consumption.\n\nLadybug \"Photovoltaics Performance\" component can calculate the optimal\u00a0**systemSize_** by given the annual electricity consumption.<br/>However the component is made to address fixed tilt and azimuth PV systems only.<br/>An approximate way to overcome this is to calculate the optimal **systemSize_** for fixed tilt and azimuth PV system, and then multiply it with the \"difference in %s\" panel at the very right of the\u00a0**fixed_vs_tracker_PV2.gh**\u00a0file. Again, this is not what Ladybug \"Photovoltaics Performance\" component is made to do, but it will probably get you in a ball park.<br/><br/>\n\nInputted 32 degrees for north_ direction is actually 328 degrees.<br/>This is due to Ladybug Photovoltaics being based on NREL model which uses clockwise angles convention. This convention is also most commonly used in solar radiation analysis.\n\n<br/>Dubai weather data files are uploaded in [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fcep5p3i2594wxn/ARE_Dubai.Intl.AP_MN6.zip?dl=0).\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "November 23, 2016 at 5:29pm", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nOK, so if I understand this correctly I need to first figure out what my demand is, then it will size the PV array (square meters) to accommodate that demand.<br/><br/>If I was interested in calculating a certain system output (kWh) based on surface square footage that is available to me, then i would need to give it a \"fake\" demand.
