{"body": "\nHi Chris and Mostapha,\n\n\n\nIt seems the **mesh** and the **testpoints** generated by the **Generate Zone Test Points** component are not at the same height, and it seems that the mesh object is always positioned 1m above the floor regardless of the distance of the test points to the floor. See image below.\n\n\n\nI worry this mismatch might be misleading as the results visualized on the mesh object may not reflect the actual daylight performance as simulated at the height of the test points.\n\n\n\nCan you kindly help to check and clarify?\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\nI'm referring to the following demo file on Hydra:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;amp...;](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Honeybee_Grid-based_Daylight_Simulation_Example_I&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=2.713208654895345&amp;offset=-702.420564547888,-567.1220793648746)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/y9G3WvU4wnSGcs9pIOjyCOX238MdQiAQj0rlSzpliYE4fEQ3l2Qq-lKmrKB*H5MMeMJVoHxgIHklWIp00oVqD1-Q-4H45POV/Image1.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/y9G3WvU4wnSGcs9pIOjyCOX238MdQiAQj0rlSzpliYE4fEQ3l2Qq-lKmrKB*H5MMeMJVoHxgIHklWIp00oVqD1-Q-4H45POV/Image1.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "July 27, 2016 at 10:28am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "daylight analysis mesh and test points are not at the same height", "replies": [{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nThanks for letting us know. \u00a0This seems like a bug and so I fixed it:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/d1271d80501230f...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/d1271d80501230ff0c62ddedd172d9d041ecf39f)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 27, 2016 at 6:01pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you very much, Chris, for the prompt patch!\n\n\n\nThe mesh is in the right position now.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "July 28, 2016 at 8:20am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1572135"}
