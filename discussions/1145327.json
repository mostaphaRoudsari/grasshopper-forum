{"body": "\nHello Guys,\n\nI was wondering if somebody could help me with a simple question, I have been trying to analyse the daylight in a public space during the whole year.\n\nThere is any way to have an average day using that period? So the range of my table is going to be in a daily basis showing between 0 and 8 hrs instead of from 0 to 92 hrs.\n\n\n\nMany thanks and congrats for this awesome tool!\n\n\n\n**Nico**\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4hNukqhfhE1uVNiDXBGkV4lOvHsd*qnf0G3A8cWojgdo946OohGX6ygjxpCVpbRWMB0GE-jMZcNofBXhuTkTW5t2lSrge64y/2b.jpg\" width=\"700\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4hNukqhfhE1uVNiDXBGkV4lOvHsd*qnf0G3A8cWojgdo946OohGX6ygjxpCVpbRWMB0GE-jMZcNofBXhuTkTW5t2lSrge64y/2b.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nicolas Cabargas Mori", "created_at": "October 8, 2014 at 5:15am", "created_by": "NicolasCabargasMori", "topic": "Daylight Average for One day in a whole year period.", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Nico,\n\nI'm not sure if I understand your question right but if you mean how can you run it for every day and then average them you can use branching. It will take longer though.

If the result that you posted is showing the average for 1 day, across the whole year is exactly what I need.
