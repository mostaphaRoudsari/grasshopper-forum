{"body": "\nHello,\n\nat the beginning, simulation was working just fine and after several different set ups on the same model it falls apart. I'm getting different energy simulation results every time I run simulation with same set ups. After several attempts I run simulation on different PC and there worked just fine but I can't work on the 2nd PC because it's not mine.\n\nHow to solve this problem. Here is the link of the discussion I've posted before (this very problem):\u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/different-energy-simulati...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/different-energy-simulation-results-with-same-set-up).\u00a0\n\nFile is attached in the linked discussion.\n\nP.S. Even though the name of attached file in link is daylight simulation, just ignore it because both energy and daylight simulation are in the same file.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vanja Ku\u0161en", "created_at": "April 24, 2017 at 1:35pm", "created_by": "VanjaKusen", "topic": "Different energy simulation results with same set up", "replies": [], "id": "1739002"}
