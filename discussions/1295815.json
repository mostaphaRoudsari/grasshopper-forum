Honeybee doesn't have a component for that, but it's pretty straightforward to do it using Radiance's PValue ([http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/pvalue.1.html](http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/pvalue.1.html)). If you are more comfortable using an interface then try wxFalseColor ([http://tbleicher.github.io/wxfalsecolor/](http://tbleicher.github.io/wxfalsecolor/)).\n\n\n\n2. Not possible at the moment.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 11, 2015 at 8:37am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI'd like to share an experience here, and perhaps a workflow that might be interesting to some. I've been messing around with rhendering lately. I find that realistic renderings are great tools in trying to display sustainable building attributes and advantages. One of the interesting areas of intersection between rendering and LB/HB is daylighting of course.\n\n\n\nThe workflow I'm doing is something of a 'on-site' daylighting analysis. This consists of actual site visits, that being an empty lot or a room in some building, and using digital cameras to take a number of HDR images in order to compose an HDR dome (at a certain time of day ofc). This dome then can be used to light your scene (e.g. an interior viewpoint of a room)\u00a0in most renderers thereby creating not only a nice photorealistic result (due to the native HDR quality) but also a photometrically accurate result (i.e. shadows, glare, and luminance 'as is' on site)!\n\n\n\nNow, most renderers can output this as an HDR image which can then be linked to HB, allowing for some environmental analysis of rendered images. Linking these two workflows, both taking place within Rhino, is quite valuable in my opinion. As a sanity check, this would work with the current components handling HDRs no? Finally, a feature in HB like the one described Dalia, while not necessary, would enchance this workflow. Or is anyone out there working on porting wsFalseColor? :)\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "July 18, 2015 at 11:02pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHello\n\n\n\nI had a similar problem and tried to use the\u00a0wxFalseColor but I cant get it to work.
