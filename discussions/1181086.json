There are two components for that. Try\u00a0\"Honeybee_Read All the Hourly Results from Annual Daylight Study\" or\u00a0\"Honeybee_Read Hourly Results from Annual Daylight Study\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond question is related to first as if the analysis is for radiance then there is no point to check the autonomy based on lux ( I assume...)\n\nI'm not sure if I follow here. Annual analysis is using Daysim which is developed on top of Radiance. I don't know if it does make any difference but Daylight autonomy is % of time, and not in lux\n\n\n\nYes. Default is 300 but you can overwrite it by setting the value for\u00a0_DLAIllumThresholds_\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 5, 2014 at 7:42pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for the explanations.\n\nOne more question:\n\nI use the HOY component and says I can use \"list of numbers\" for days months or hours.
