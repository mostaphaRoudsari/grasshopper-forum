{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha, Chris and group members,\n\n\n\nThe **Ladybug_AnalysisPeriod** component could set a continuous period of time not the discontinuous or separated. So how to set a same period of each day (ex. the 5 a.m to 7 p.m of everyday from June 5th to July 9th), and a certain time during a long period (ex. 12 a.m of every day on June)?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n\nBi Xiaojian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "January 6, 2017 at 12:33am", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "topic": "Simulation Period Setting", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 8, 2017 at 1:38pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris, So glad to hear from you. What you said did a great help. And that is why I choose to use discountinuous period of time in the process of post visualization of Ep results. And the HOY component did the same thing which separates each hour of the period I selected, is that right?
