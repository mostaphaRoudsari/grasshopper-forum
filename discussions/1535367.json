I have some idea about the daylighting aspect of Honeybee source-code. Right now, it is somewhat (if not overly) aligned with the Windows way of doing things. Among the many things that Mac does differently:\n\n1. Handling of batch files.\n\n2. Default handling of file paths python.\n\n3. Multi-core processing of Radiance/daylighting commands (Mac opens up a lot more possibilities).\n\n\n\nIt might be an interesting exercise to see how far some one get Honeybee to work and then probably fix/change/upgrade the code from there on.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 23, 2016 at 2:00am", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}], "id": "1535367"}
