{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI am a new user to grasshopper and ladybug, and I have ran into a problem when I try to use the Ladybug ''bounce from surface'' component to do a reflected sun study.\n\n\n\nI would like to trace the sun rays that bounce off of the ****_SourceSrfs**** geometry and strike surrounding ****context_**** geometry.\n\nAt the same time, I do not want to trace any sun rays that are blocked by ****context_**** geometry, nor any sun rays that bounce off of the ****context_**** geometry first and then strike other ****context_**** geometry.\n\n\n\nThis should be consistent with the stated functioning of the component, but it appears that the component does not discard blocked sun rays.\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0****context_****\u00a0geometry info bubble states the component will reflect sun rays **AFTER** they bounce of the**\u00a0_sourceSrfs\u00a0**. The behavior seems not work work like this.\n\n\n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vRWi3e17RGqoovml3KFyI17nNpH2ucmBbGUxZ-YAr23N9AS6Z1oqCbZs*6qpd9KjZafN2W6TlKcpoD9iGDEtOHmtAR56RK6X/bouncefromsurface.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vRWi3e17RGqoovml3KFyI17nNpH2ucmBbGUxZ-YAr23N9AS6Z1oqCbZs*6qpd9KjZafN2W6TlKcpoD9iGDEtOHmtAR56RK6X/bouncefromsurface.jpg)\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMatt\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1242633", "name": "bounce-from-surface.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1242634", "name": "bounce-from-surface-test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Matthew Fielding", "created_at": "March 14, 2015 at 3:08pm", "created_by": "MatthewFielding", "topic": "''Bounce From Surface'' not discarding blocked sun rays", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Matthew\n\n\n\nGlad you joined the community. I'm not quite sure that I understand your problem but from the image I assume that you want to isolate only the bounces from the source surf. If this is the case, I did something similar on a skylight project. See the explation bellow and attached file. Hope it helps.\n\n\n\ncheers\n\n\n\nclaudio\n\n\n\nFind the intersection of the sunrays and source surf (this will return the pas on surf that receives sunrays)\n\nFind the discontinuity of the sun rays (this returns all the sunrays bounces)\n\n-FIRST ISLOATION- Isolate the\u00a0second (1) and third (2) items from the discontinuity component (last and second to last sunray bounce)\n\n-SECOND ISOLATION- Isolate the second item of the -FIRST ISOLATION- (this returns the last bounce of the sunrays)\n\nFind a target srf that your are interested in evaluating.\n\nCreate a Beep with the target geometry (it needs to be a solid geometry)\n\nFind if the pas of the SECOND ISOLATION are inside the target Brep\n\nDispatch the points of the previous action into true (they are inside) false (they are outside)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1242809", "name": "bouncefromsurfacetest_CN.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "March 15, 2015 at 1:18pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "replies": [{"body": "\nMatthew, thanks for the comment and, Claudio, thanks for the response. It sounds like Claudio's method should work in your case.
