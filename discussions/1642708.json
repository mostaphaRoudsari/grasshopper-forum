{"body": "\nHello\n\n\n\nThis might be a very easy question, but I have been having trouble getting rid of my back box in Rhino when I run grid-based daylighting simulation. and I cannot see my results due to that.\u00a0\n\nI am using an example file provided in Hydra website. When I change the way windows are introduced to the model, the back box is created. Simulation is running, that I can tell. But I don't know how to make the box disappear to see my results.\n\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1642706", "name": "CCC_Honeybee_Grid-based_Daylight_Simulation_Good.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1642707", "name": "HB-Wire.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 20, 2016 at 2:23pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "Issue with Graphics (How to Change to Wire-frame Preview)", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ladan,\n\n<br/>if I have understood correctly, you mean how to disable the preview of the building brep.
