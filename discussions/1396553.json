{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha and Chris,\n\n\n\nI got the following errors from the \"readEPResult\" component, when I ran it in a new laptop:\n\n\n\n1. Your simulation probably did not run correctly. <br/>Check the report out of the Run Simulation component to see what severe or fatal errors happened in the simulation. <br/>If there are no severe or fatal errors, the issue could just be that there is .eio file adjacent to the .csv _resultFileAddress. <br/>Check the folder of the file address you are plugging into this component and make sure that there is both a .csv and .eio file in the folder.\n\n\n\nIn my case, no\u00a0severe or fatal\u00a0errors happened in the simulation, and no\u00a0eio file generated in the folder, but some\u00a0csv files of customised schedules.\n\n\n\nIt didn't happen in my original laptop when I used exactly the same GH file to run. **Could you please let me know what could be the problem?** (Maybe some problems related to installation? but I followed exactly the same as\u00a0**Installation Instructions\u00a0**in the downlaod page. Thank you in advance!\n\n\n\nI noticed that someone else also had similar questions in the forum, but no clear answer was given yet. Thank you once again.\n\n\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/hb-runenergysimulation-do...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/hb-runenergysimulation-doesn-t-run?groupUrl=ladybug&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987&amp;id=2985220%3ATopic%3A1263701&amp;page=1#comments)\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/running-sev...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/running-several-e-simulations-at-a-time?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1390026&amp;xg_source=activity&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "November 9, 2015 at 4:54am", "created_by": "doudou", "topic": "\"readEPResult\" component errors", "replies": [{"body": "\nDing,\n\nI won't know what is going wrong unless you upload the example file with the error. \u00a0I will take a look if you do so. \u00a0Make sure the you are using the newest release that was issued earlier today.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 9, 2015 at 12:00pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nDing,\n\nI should also note that the new release includes better error messages when things go wrong with this components. \u00a0Let me know if the new version is solving your issue.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 11, 2015 at 2:58pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\nSorry for my late reply, and thank you so much for your kind help!\n\nThe errors mentioned above has disappeared when I updated to the newest version.\n\nBut, problems regarding the \"readAnnualResultsI\" component occur in daylight simulation, for which I will put it in another poster.\n\nThank you once again.\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "December 16, 2015 at 8:18am", "created_by": "doudou", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1396553"}
