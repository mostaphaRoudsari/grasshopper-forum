{"body": "\nHi all\n\nI have been modelling a simple room with a light shelf for a small study that I am doing. I am not quite sure that the results I get are accurate. Maybe someone here can share their wisdom :)\n\nI have modelled the room to have both an internal and external light shelf. The external shelf can be angled so that light should be reflected further into the room, which it does indeed do, but to a very limited extent as can be seen in figures 1-3 (this is a vertical WP in the YZ-plane):\n\nFigure 1 - No light shelf:\n\n\u00a0[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/72Jod1iYAGEsfTnWI*TTlTwL5xAS24leGjUk5goidR8e4hAR7r2iulQdL3LuU6MaSGgyfDM1Pm*-f0Ojaa1nzju48yyM6hZR/VerticalWP_withoutLS.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/72Jod1iYAGEsfTnWI*TTlTwL5xAS24leGjUk5goidR8e4hAR7r2iulQdL3LuU6MaSGgyfDM1Pm*-f0Ojaa1nzju48yyM6hZR/VerticalWP_withoutLS.png)\n\nFigure 2 - Flat lightshelf:\n\n\u00a0[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/72Jod1iYAGFzNFazTog*0f66jzQLIWYkf6QQKocG4iyPwEy-KO*Yx2Jq9bAi7R98vIs9mq7xzXYKkL2KpHwDH5Pve8SSoG3N/VerticalWP_withLS.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/72Jod1iYAGFzNFazTog*0f66jzQLIWYkf6QQKocG4iyPwEy-KO*Yx2Jq9bAi7R98vIs9mq7xzXYKkL2KpHwDH5Pve8SSoG3N/VerticalWP_withLS.png)\n\nFigure 3 - Angled lightshelf:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/72Jod1iYAGHqedHUDKLb4l-4VOTn2CoZ-N1zMmMKOJO-jU*yi1L5DYukS8QGFoq6OdrzUMD0F4xysMZbkueGQ7JW03x-CisD/VerticalWP_withAngeledLS.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/72Jod1iYAGHqedHUDKLb4l-4VOTn2CoZ-N1zMmMKOJO-jU*yi1L5DYukS8QGFoq6OdrzUMD0F4xysMZbkueGQ7JW03x-CisD/VerticalWP_withAngeledLS.png)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe thing that seems a bit strange to me is that the light shelf seems to do more bad than good. It provides shade to the area closest to the window, thus reducing the illuminance in that area, but doesn`t reflect the light as much as I thought it would. As I said, setting the external shelf at an angle has some positive effect, but not at the back of the room which is the part that should be benefitting from the light shelf. Also, I would have thought that keeping it flat should also do some good.\n\nI have set reflectance parameters to quite high values in attempt to get the light into the room, but it does not have the effect that I hoped for. The reflectance values for the ceiling and the light shelf are also set to values quite a lot higher than on\u00a0the floor, but the floor still seems to reflect better. The dimensions of the room are: width = 3m, depth = 6m, height = 3m.\n\nWhat could be the problem? Help is much appreciated!\n\n--\n\nAttached is the gh file (with a horizontal work-plane) and the compressed results files if you don`t have the patience to run the simulation.\n\nThe gh file follows the example of M. Roudsari`s \"getting started files\" to Honeybee. Simply toggle \"2\" to true and press \"3\" to run all the simulations. If you edit the input list in \"1\", be sure to change the max values in the sliders as well. Finally, you can visualize the results by dragging the sliders in 4.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1031208", "name": "20140318-Single-room_ClerestoreyTESTING4b.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1031209", "name": "ResultFiles.zip"}], "created_by_name": "\u00d6rn Erlendsson", "created_at": "March 24, 2014 at 2:42am", "created_by": "OErnErlendsson", "topic": "Light shelf not doing what it should?", "replies": [{"body": "\nNot exactly wisdom but i would recommend to increase the -ab radiance parameter to al least 4 (default is 2).

Shade the surrounding area. You should have a more even distribution of the light with lightshelf.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DqaYw0w2aP*UlOQARdgT9obMjTAVABhSKDSeSDlhRt88EW*U8WJGCQVNUv8nwO8l1DDFLxWzcjS-K5B5jTsn50G4CaTddXTM/TopView.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DqaYw0w2aP*UlOQARdgT9obMjTAVABhSKDSeSDlhRt88EW*U8WJGCQVNUv8nwO8l1DDFLxWzcjS-K5B5jTsn50G4CaTddXTM/TopView.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some parameters that you can change to have a better idea from the effects of your lightshelf.\n\n\n\n1. I would make the room deeper so you get some dark space at the end of the room.\n\n2. I would make the room wider while keeping the test grid in the center to avoid the effect of the side walls. You can also assign black colors to the side walls.\n\n3. Set a view from inside the room and render the images. You will see how lightshelf changes the daylight pattern inside the space. Creating false color images also helps for an easier to understand visualization.\n\n3. Now try it for different times of the year to see the effect of the sun angle (both on the grid and the images).\n\n4. Finally run an annual analysis with and without lightshelf.\n\n\n\nSetting the parameters to a higher quality will mainly change the results at the end of the room. As Abraham mentioned for this case you need to increase the number of bounces.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 24, 2014 at 10:16pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you Mostapha.
