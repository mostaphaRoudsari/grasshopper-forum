{"body": "\nHi everyone,\u00a0\n\nI have over 60 radiance files that I need to re simulate through Honeybee.\u00a0\n\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to automate the simulation process of lets say just two models for now?\n\nCould I set a group of files/components (Rad, pts, weather, file names) have that set be called say \"set one\" simulated that, then have another set called set two then simulate that. And it goes through a list or slider (1 - 60)?\u00a0\n\nI have attached a file trying to show what I mean.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\u00a0\n\nSandi\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1789435", "name": "Testing List Simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sandi Sirikhanchai", "created_at": "July 26, 2017 at 9:28pm", "created_by": "SandiSirikhanchai", "topic": "Simulating a list of files", "replies": [{"body": "\nHave you tried the [fly component?](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Parametric_Daylight_Analysis&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=8&amp;offset=67.60921491139334,-2404.516012324071)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "July 27, 2017 at 4:13pm", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": []}], "id": "1789436"}
