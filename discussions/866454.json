I assume you add up the result into a single number. If that is the case you can connect all the geometries to geometry and leave the context input.\n\nYou may also want to try Octopus ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/octopus](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/octopus)) and solve it as a multi-objective problem.\n\nApparently you are intensively using the bug these days! That's pretty cool. :) As I said if you want to fully enjoy the use of parallel option let me know to send you a newer version for test.\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 6, 2013 at 5:47pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nFrancesco,\n\nIt seems that we got similar interest in Environmental studies (Ladybug, Galapagos ...or Octopus).

The goal is that to find the optimal layout of three buildings inside a plot. The scope is that to have the maximum direct sunlight hours hitting the facades of the three buildings. So I used the Ladubug Sunlight hour component (in the way it is possible to see at the beginning of this post) to obtain the sunlight hours for each building and in each of this one building is the geonmetry and the other two are the context (after that I got to know that it is possible to do everything also with only one component and not three). So I used the Galapagos evolutonary solver used in Maximize mode. I am still working on this, in the videao you can see the three towers ca just shift inside the plot, in a new simulation I am working on they can also rotate.\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"420\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/HMOKcO_KNJU?wmode=opaque\" width=\"420\"></iframe>\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "July 2, 2013 at 9:32am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Francesco!

I have three buildings with different height that I have to place on a plot. The goal is that the building create as less as possible overshadowing on each other. So I am calculating the result separately because each time one building is the Geometry (input) and the other two are the Context (input). If I would calculate together I have to use all the buildings at the same time as Geometry and as Context, so I thought that if a building is Geometry and Context at the same time the calculation can get wrong. Isn't it?\n\nThank you for the indication about Octopus, I will see about it.\n\nWell yes I am using quite a lot your tool recently, thank you for your work. I am preparing the materials for a workshop about these topics I will tutor in my university and I think I will use LadyBug and Diva.
