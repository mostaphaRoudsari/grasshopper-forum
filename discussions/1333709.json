The Rhino's orientCameraToSrf is actually doing the opposite of want I want.\n\n\n\nBut I figure out a way to do it: create a small line section positioned at the centroid of a surface and align with the normal of the surface, and it will be used a reference to define a camera view by camera and target positions.
