I really don\u00b4t know what is the problem with my model, it is a very simple one by the way... I would like next add a downdraft evapoative cooling tower, but next step... Could you please help me to fix this first problem ? It may also be a pb with the installation of the different softwares used ..\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your help !\n\n\n\nSeverine\n\n\n\n\n\ngh file attached\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1768826", "name": "ZONE_bat2_PB.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Severine", "created_at": "June 13, 2017 at 8:53pm", "created_by": "Severine", "topic": "Solution exception:index out of range: 0", "replies": [{"body": "\nSeverine,<br/> Reinsert the HB_setEPNatVent.
