I' fully updated :-). I can say now that the issue is solved. I was using CIE sky with simulation type 1 (Radiation). This combination doesn't produce the output (my fault). Other options (illuminance and luminance do).\n\nJust one other thing, the genCumSky component failed to download the GenCumulativeSky.exe, so i needed to download it manually. Not a biggy but maybe you want to know/be aware of this, since i noticed that there are issues with downloading and updating.\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 4, 2014 at 12:47pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nAs far as I know CIE skies should be generating radiation results.

You can't run radiation analysis with CIE skies and you need to use other climate-based skies for that. My bad.
