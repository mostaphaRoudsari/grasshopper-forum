{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\ncompliments for the plug-in very interesting and complete.\n\nI have simulated this type of shading device composed by perforated alluminium sheet (in attached you can find an example). I have the features of the these alluminium panel such as RGB and percentage open area and i set up like trans material. But i don't succeed to link these type of material on their surface and create HB surface.\u00a0\n\n<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/FsV0PLw632qRtUoqrMuowDoBX2wgE0*LzEz8Dgkg8ow4UluKvufSwmPMJKnINYwgrjeipV4C3fAapl0MuMaON-Shc*BBVQRM/Honeybeeerror1.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>\n\nIn this case trans material with shading device. What component i have to use in these analysis.\n\nI hope I shall be clear\n\nThank you so much.\n\nCheers\n\nAndrea\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1096470", "name": "Shading view.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1096471", "name": "Honeybee error1.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1096472", "name": "Canvas.png"}], "created_by_name": "Andrea Zani", "created_at": "July 2, 2014 at 3:18pm", "created_by": "AndreaZani905", "topic": "Problem with honeybee transmaterial", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Andrea,\n\nI cannot reproduce the error on my system.

There was a mistake in assignment of material name.\n\nThe results (daylight factor) that I obtained with Honeybee are different from the radiance results. Is this possible? Materials and parameters selected are the same in both analysis. For example 1.4 with Honeybee and 1.9 with Radiance. In the case without shading sheets the value is about 2.8, smaller than I expected.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your attention.\n\nBye\n\nAndrea\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrea Zani", "created_at": "July 3, 2014 at 3:23pm", "created_by": "AndreaZani905", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Andrea,\n\nSomething happened to my reply so I'm trying again.\n\nNot sure what do you mean by \"The results (daylight factor) that I obtained with Honeybee are different from the radiance results. Is this possible?\" Honeybee uses RADIANCE for simulating DF. It doesn't have an engine.\n\nAre you using same parameters in both cases? As you are using a trans material make sure that you set parameters for specular reflection right and also set the -ab to an acceptable number for the case with shading.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 3, 2014 at 6:22pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}]}]}
