What is the context? Do you want to make sure that window is looking inwards? Are you using HBZone for daylight modeling or creating the model surface by surface? In the former window will always be looking outwards so you should reverse the order. In the second one you can use HBSurface.normal to calculate the angle between the surfaces to check.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 27, 2015 at 11:08pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha, I was actually trying to write a quick and dirty hack for the 3phase method within\u00a0 Grasshopper/Honeybee when I noticed that the only way to achieve a fair amount of automation is to calculate view direction by code and then feed it to genklemsamp. Based on how the model was created, the order of vertices, and therefore the direction of the surface normal, is likely to cause an issue. So I thought of testing where the surface normal of the glazing faced wrt the floor surface.\n\n\n\nDo you think there is an elegant solution to this ?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "October 28, 2015 at 12:14am", "created_by": "sarith", "replies": [{"body": "\nThat's a very cool hack!
