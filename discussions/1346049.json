{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nAs you said, I actually tried the mass addition of the values and it is not equal to the totalSunlightHours. I also tried changing the number of test points to around twice as many, but the totalSunlightHours did not change much (just a little). That's why I was wondering how it was calculated\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saurabh Shrestha", "created_at": "August 19, 2015 at 9:38pm", "created_by": "SaurabhShrestha", "topic": "totalSunlightHours", "replies": [{"body": "\nI checked the source. I multiply the values to the area of mesh faces and then add them up to make sure the meshing won't make biased results for comparative studies. I think it can only be useful for comparative studies.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KkxqEnBJGWDlaFaRnBpyGylqplVS1uenWhKx9zMtwt*N-oP3C-2ijtg27jpAjdsNa6YOFyPbjaO8yqEpEIqBexB47pTwLy3w/totalSunlightHours.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KkxqEnBJGWDlaFaRnBpyGylqplVS1uenWhKx9zMtwt*N-oP3C-2ijtg27jpAjdsNa6YOFyPbjaO8yqEpEIqBexB47pTwLy3w/totalSunlightHours.png)\n\n\n\nThanks for opening a discussion!\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 19, 2015 at 9:51pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nThat makes sense!
