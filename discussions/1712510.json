If so,why the SRI is not considered? Have you in mind to consider it in future release?\n\n2) There is someone that developed a .gh model able to assess the SRI?\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco", "created_at": "March 14, 2017 at 10:48am", "created_by": "Francesco897", "topic": "SRI, Solar reflectance index", "replies": []}
