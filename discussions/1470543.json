I will check also your version later today when I am getting back to the drawing board. I am trying to model up a building based on defining each zone and then playing with their location within the building - to get there I need to fully understand the basic of the software - and while I am learning I thought why not use the building form I already have and I need to complete for my thesis - that is why I started with the big oval building.
