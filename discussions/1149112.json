{"body": "\nHello Guys,\n\n\n\nI took the definition in this discussion( [http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/glare-analysis](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/glare-analysis))\n\nThe idea is to illustrate the galre risk of a given Srf that is in front of a glass building. I\u00a0manage to create a mesh that displays the risk of glare over the whole year.\n\nBut now my client asks if its possible to have a false color image (like evalglare) from the interior of the building looking towards the glass building in order to evaluate the possible glare at a working station. I guess using HoneyBee I'll be able to get that glare analysis.\u00a0\n\nWhat will be the method to evaluate the glare over the whole year?\n\nHow can I\u00a0contro\u00a0the reflectance of the glass building within a HoneyBee_Radiance_Glass Material\n\n\n\nThank you all in advance\n\n\n\ncheers\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "October 14, 2014 at 8:18pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "Glare analysis according to a reflectance % of a glass panel", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\nMostapha will probably jump in with some better information after me but I thought that I should post what I know now in case it helps you get started. \u00a0You are right that you can do in-depth glare analysis with the Honeybee components related to daylight/Radiance.\n\nAlso, I can confirm that will definitely be making a big jump from the previous discussion that you quoted. \u00a0However, you will ultimately be able to get a much more accurate understanding of the glare risk this way.\n\nIn order to narrow down your run time, I might start by selecting out a a set of hours of the year where you are interested in studying the glare probability (since running the entire year can be a lengthy calculation that takes many hours). \u00a0Next, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1) Set up your Rhino geometry as you would for any daylight simulation. \u00a0Import the geometry into Grasshopper as breps and convert them to HBObjects. \u00a0For the glass on the outside of the building across the street, I would model the glass as a mirror material instead of a\u00a0HoneyBee_Radiance_Glass Material and set the reflectance of the mirror equal to that of the glass exterior. \u00a0This should ensure that the material behaves as you want it to.\n\n2) Plug the HBObjects into a Run Daylight Simulation component for which you have hooked up an image-based analysisRecipe_ that is set up at the Rhino view of the work station that you are studying.\n\n3) After running the image-based simulation, use the resulting HDR image and a Honeybee_Glare Analysis component to post-process the image to get a daylight glare probability (DGP) for the workstation at the hour of the image.\n\n4) Repeat for more hours of the year so that you get a sense of the times when glare might be an issue.\n\n\n\nLet us know if you have any questions and, Mostapha, let me know if I forgot anything important. \u00a0Hopefully, we will get around to producing a tutorial video on this at some point.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 14, 2014 at 9:59pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nGreat,\n\nAs Always Chris you've\u00a0come to the rescue. I wish at some time I'll be able to post some images and workarounds of these projects. So far they are in a confidential state and I can't show anything. But in time I'll try to post something.\n\nOne more question: How can I control the reflectiveness of the mirror like Srf as it requires R-G-BReflectance (I guess that is RGB colors) if the glass reflects 27% of the light should I input 27 for all three. I try to understand the Radiance materials (www. artifice.com) but it does not say much. And what kind of sky should be used for the analysis recipe\n\nThank you\n\nCheers\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "October 15, 2014 at 7:49am", "created_by": "Claudio", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nOk First attempt no very successfully.

In the results of the glare analysis colors are randomly assigned and has no meaning more than source of the glare. You can read it in evalglare documentation file as \"The color is chosen by chance, no significance is given by the color\"\n\n2. To understand the probability of glare you should check DGP values.\n\n3. The algorithms that are used in evalglare are based of studies for stationary desks and for indoor offices.
