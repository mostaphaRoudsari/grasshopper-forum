{"body": "\nHello, <br/>I have made a test EnergyPlus glass material and am trying to run the export to OpenStudio component but I get the following error: -<br/>**Severe** WindowMaterial:Glazing=\"TESTGLASS\" has Optical Data Type = Spectral but has no matching MaterialProperty:GlazingSpectralData set. Is there any way to rectify this within Honeybee? So far the only way I have been able to run the simulation is within OpenStudio,\u00a0by opening OpenStudio and changing the Optical Data Type of \"TESTWINDOW\" from \"Spectral\" to \"SpectralAverage\".\u00a0 The .gh file is attached.\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1677538", "name": "Openstudio Test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "James Crowley", "created_at": "January 24, 2017 at 7:24am", "created_by": "JamesCrowley", "topic": "Issue with export to Openstudio", "replies": [{"body": "\nThis is a bug in the OpenStudio API.
