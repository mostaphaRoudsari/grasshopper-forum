I will be capturing a number of videos **for developers** soon. We are so excited to see all the new developers joining the team and we understand the need to support you to get started. I hope these videos can help you to understand the development logic and get you started with the development.\n\n\n\n**OK. Now if you have access to Internet, which I supposed you do as you are reading this online, you have no excuse not to learn Ladybug and Honeybee. :)**\n\n\n\nLet us know your comments and suggestions.\n\nCheers, Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 29, 2014 at 7:48pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "topic": "New Set of Ladybug and Honeybee Video Tutorials", "replies": [{"body": "\nThis is wonderful!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "September 30, 2014 at 12:57am", "created_by": "djordje", "replies": []}, {"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "September 30, 2014 at 12:58am", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nReally interesting stuff and great work!
