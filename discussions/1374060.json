{"body": "\nHey,\n\n@Mostapha\n\n@Chris\n\nThanks a lot for the tip about\u00a0rtcontrib and 3-phase method. As for general descriptions, rtcontrib seems a good mechanism for gathering rays and analyzing individual ray contributions to daylight coefficients. Not sure yet how it works, though.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThere used to be a rtcontrib userguide (rtcontrib_lesson) by Axel\u00a0Jacobs. However it seems it is not available anymore. Did you have a chance to download it before it was deleted ?\u00a0\n\n\n\nCheers,\u00a0\n\nMagdalena\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Magdalena Stefanowicz", "created_at": "October 6, 2015 at 6:25am", "created_by": "MagdalenaStefanowicz", "topic": "Projecting Daylight", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Magdalena,\n\nAxel decided to bring it down while ago for his personal reasons.
