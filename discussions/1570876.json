You want to look at the\u00a0'HVAC System' tab and in the 'Thermal Zones' tab to get a full understanding of the system components using this method.\n\n\n\nIf you could be more specific about which assumptions you are trying to understand, I might be able to point you to some better resources.\n\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 25, 2016 at 6:35pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you Chris I will look at the OSM files. When I've built 90.1-App-G models by hand the fan power is the tricky bit. The model has to be run twice. First time to obtain AHU air volumes used for fan power calculation. Calculated fan powers are entered into the model and it is re-run. I will see what the fan power assumptions are in the OSM files, since that fan power process is probably not yet included and automated.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Arpan Bakshi", "created_at": "July 26, 2016 at 2:23am", "created_by": "ArpanBakshi", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nArpan,\n\nYour specific question about the fan is helpful narrows down the topic a lot. \u00a0Still, there are a number of variables related to the fan that have the words \"Fan Power\" in them. \u00a0In particular, if you open an OSM in OPenStudio and click on a fan, you see there's \"Fan Power Minimum Flow Rate Input Method\", \"Fan Power Minimum Flow Fraction\" and several \"Fan Power Coefficients\".\n\nYou can see on the Honeybee airDetails component that I give you the option to override many aspects of the fan like the fanEfficiency and the fanPressureRise. \u00a0If you need the ability to change one of the fan power variables, just let me know and I can add it into the airDetails component.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 26, 2016 at 6:51am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1570876"}
