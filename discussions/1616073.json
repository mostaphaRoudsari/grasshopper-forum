{"body": "\nI have a quick question about a ladybug error I am having.\u00a0 I am trying to run the \"Outdoor Comfort SET\" script (found at: [http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Outdoor_Comfort_SET&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0))\u00a0and cannot get the visualization of the vertical wind speed variation to work.\u00a0 Im attaching a screenshot of the full script and a zoomed in one of the visualization panel giving me the issues.\u00a0 I cant seem to get the error messages to appear in the image, but basically they say:<br/>\"1. The input windProfileHeight_ cannot be less than 0.\"<br/>\"2. The input distBetweenVec_ cannot be less than 0 and cannot be less than the windProfileHeight_.\"<br/><br/>I have tried using sliders instead of the text value panels that come loaded in the script, but neither seems to work even though I seem to be satisfying the requirements from the error messages.<br/><br/>Hoping someone can tell me what the issue is!\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1616071", "name": "Canvas at 15;13;27 - WIND SPEED VARIATION WITH HEIGHT - ERROR - FULL CANVAS.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1616072", "name": "Canvas at 15;13;27 - WIND SPEED VARIATION WITH HEIGHT - ERROR.png"}], "created_by_name": "Noah Geupel", "created_at": "October 10, 2016 at 11:43am", "created_by": "NoahGeupel", "topic": "Ladybug \"Outdoor Comfort SET\" Script Issue", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Noah,\n\n\n\nPlease disconnect \"windProfileHeight_\" and \"distBetweenVec_.\" That Should work.\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "October 10, 2016 at 12:13pm", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "\nYou are absolutely correct, Devang, and thanks for posting the answer. \u00a0I made that example file with a Rhino model in meters and so those inputs in Rhino model units might not work if your Rhino model units are different.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 16, 2016 at 11:14am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}]}]}
