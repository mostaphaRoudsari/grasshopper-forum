{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\nI have got a question regarding the Daylight Factor.\n\nHow can\u00a0I consider some context surfaces\u00a0in a daylight simulation?\n\nIs there an equivalent to the \"HoneyBee Ep context surfaces\" component for a daylight simulation?\n\nI think and hope there is, but\u00a0I haven\u00b4t found it yet!\n\nThanks in advance\n\nClaudia\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 17, 2016 at 6:23am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Context Surfaces for Daylight Simulation", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Claudia\n\n\n\nAnything you plug into HBObjects in the Daylight Simulation in honeybee will be considered as context. The daylight sim will be generated on the test geometry from your daylight simulation analysis recipe.\n\nFor the context geometry you'll need to use the Honeybee_createHBSrfs giving the correct reflectance or transmittance depending on the material type.\n\n\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nDuncan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "June 17, 2016 at 7:09am", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "replies": [{"body": "\nYes!!
