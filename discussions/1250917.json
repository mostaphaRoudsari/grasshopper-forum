{"body": "\nHi thank you for the Ladybug/Honeybee tool it has been a great help for my research! I ran the simulation as mentioned in the videos, I noticed that even if I put hourly in time step, Energyplus \u00a0runs it for every ten minutes, I would like to get the data out as it is, for ten or 15 mins. How or where should I change the parameter?\u00a0\n\nThank you,\n\nVinu\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "March 26, 2015 at 12:03pm", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "topic": "Simulation output in 15 minutes time step", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Vinu - You can use Energy Simulation Par to set it up.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 26, 2015 at 12:24pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/JcikeZL6OiLjmRtjOG3jMep0FsjBv*GFl-TuIl0YojO4jrj3y5lKPqMGXjHRPgerpO17bNHZe3Zt51RgdRqMKgSHoOkI69O1/simulationParameters.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/JcikeZL6OiLjmRtjOG3jMep0FsjBv*GFl-TuIl0YojO4jrj3y5lKPqMGXjHRPgerpO17bNHZe3Zt51RgdRqMKgSHoOkI69O1/simulationParameters.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 26, 2015 at 12:25pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nThank you Mostapha for the quick reply!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "March 26, 2015 at 5:21pm", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, I tried doing it but it not changing the output for me...

If I understand right you are not only looking to run the analysis every 15 minutes but also you are trying to get the results for every 15 minutes?\n\nIf that is the case then you need to set timestep input for simulationOutputs to timestep. I just made changes to the component to support timestep input. The simulation runs fine but you may not be able to use some of the functionality for visualizing the results.
