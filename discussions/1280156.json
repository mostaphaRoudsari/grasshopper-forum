When you get to the point that ALL parameters are equal you probably will get similar results.

Among the different parametres i would check are: Control, Lighting levels, Schedules, etc.\n\nI myself will be glad this comparison between both simulation types.

This means****\u00a0both E+ and Daylight simulations share the same\u00a0lighting schedule.** So I assume their results should be more or less similar or not that different, even though there might be some difference in their calculation methods.\u00a0\n\nBut, having tried many times, the result generated by the\u00a0\"Honeybee_Daysim Electrical Lighting Use\" is usually much less than that\u00a0generated by the\u00a0\"Honeybee_Read EP Result\" (**e.g. 160.5 kwh vs 369.425\u00a0kwh as in the current parameter**).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ytz*1w0-YzBtBDDqGt3QU25s8PMPcpjYbdmDe1EO*W813hTJqmnVtfpYnrsw3sFI-Ry*YgjgNNMK9o*d5X5skvqZ75yEEYhM/largedifference.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ytz*1w0-YzBtBDDqGt3QU25s8PMPcpjYbdmDe1EO*W813hTJqmnVtfpYnrsw3sFI-Ry*YgjgNNMK9o*d5X5skvqZ75yEEYhM/largedifference.png)\n\nIn addition, in\u00a0\"Honeybee_Lighting control Recipe\",\u00a0default parameters (lightingPower = 250, lightingSetpoint = 300, ballastLossFactor = 20, standbyPower = 3, delayTime = 5) were used in the current case except \"control type\" - [5] Always on during active occupancy hours with auto dimming.\n\nIn short, both\u00a0E+ and Daylight simulations have already shared the same lighting schedule.

While the Radiance does it, the E+ doesn't at ALL. If you check the IDF created you'll see that there is no Daylighting class. So i assume that in your case the light is on all the time as specified by the schedule. That's probably the reason you get such a difference in the results.\n\nPlease see this discussion to get updated about the status of the daylighting in HB+E+:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-daylight...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-daylight-setpoint-bug)\n\nRight now it is not working, so you really can't rely in the E+ result so far.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 4, 2015 at 10:32pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThank you for the link. Actually I had already been aware of it. This is why I am trying to run daylight simulation first then pass the generated schedule to the E+ simulation for obtaining energy use of\u00a0electric lighting dimming system.\n\nBut I found a major mistake in my previous test file, that is, **the \"lighting Power\" used in the daylight simulation and the E+ simulation are NOT equal by my carelessness.** The former was 250w (default value in \"Honeybee_Lighting control Recipe\") while the later was\u00a011.8403571*50=592.018w (lightingDensityPerArea*Areaoffloor=lightingpower).\u00a0\n\nHaving corrected this mistake (by using 592.018w for both of them), the results of electric lighting energy obtained from daylight and E+ simulations\u00a0are much closer with each other and more reasonable. In order to see how close they are, I made 3 tests using 3 different weather files (New York, Amsterdam, Guangzhou).

Having checked the IDF file created, as you mentioned above,\u00a0there is no data in the Daylighting class (since the daylight control are not implemented in the E+ simulation). But, the light is **\"fully/partially\"** on according to the **\"fractions\"**\u00a0in the generated\u00a0lighting schedule list, **which already takes in account the dimming system by the setting in\u00a0\"Honeybee_Lighting control Recipe\" in daylight simulation.**\n\nThen, what\u00a0the E+ simulation did in terms of calculating\u00a0electric lighting energy use\u00a0is just as the following formulation: **lightingDensityPerArea * Areaoffloor * sum of lighting schedule list (generated by daylight simulation in this case) =\u00a0electric lighting energy use, which has been verified by the comparison of results obtained from E+ simulation and calculated by the above formulation. (The results are exactly the same.)\u00a0**Please see the updated gh file attached.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7MvbI5LgFr34fhyMg1WceXSjes-vgUyi1rA9wWpIrIZMZn6Z-vIZ0H0Q*iMxrBWQ0sAvPKjLRiLPoCFWHmDL-ua/QQ20150505122633.png\" width=\"463\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7MvbI5LgFr34fhyMg1WceXSjes-vgUyi1rA9wWpIrIZMZn6Z-vIZ0H0Q*iMxrBWQ0sAvPKjLRiLPoCFWHmDL-ua/QQ20150505122633.png)\n\nTherefore, I assume that the E+ results\u00a0generated\u00a0in this way (using the lighting schedule\u00a0generated\u00a0by the daylight simulation) are still reliable,\u00a0although there exist some tiny difference (around 3%) for some unknown reason (**Maybe Daysim does not follow the same formulation mentioned above? Can you imagine the possible reason?**).\n\n\n\nIn addition,\u00a0\n\n- I am not clear with what you mentioned as \"they definitely don't share daylight considerations\". What \"daylight considerations\" here refer to? (sky condition / sky file? but in the annual Daylight Simulation, only weather file is required instead of\u00a0sky file)\n\n- A basic question: In E+ simulation, has the waste heat generated by the electric lighting been considered as \"internal heat gain\" (showed in the above image)? If so, can I say that \"energy use for electrical light\" is fully converted to \"the waste heat\" + \"Illuminance in\u00a0lux\".\n\nNamely, **energy use for electrical light =\u00a0the waste heat +\u00a0Illuminance in\u00a0lux (lux can be converted to electric power in watts)?**\n\n\n\nMany thanks!\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1280822", "name": "text8.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "May 5, 2015 at 5:32am", "created_by": "doudou", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Ding,\n\nYour explanation sounds convincing and i feel more comfortable with it.\n\nI checked the schedule file and i see that effectively, you have there the fraction of the light used for each hour. So that compensates somehow the lack of the Daylight class in E+. A difference of 3-4% is bearable. I checked also with my local EPW and i get the same range of difference.\n\nNo doubt the daylight simulation with Radiance/Daysim is more reliable than the E+, but just for you to know (maybe you do), E+ allowsup to 2 sensors in each thermal zone. It will be interesting to \"downgrade\" the daylight simulation to just one or two grid points (locates strategically in the space), instead the whole grid, and see how the results change. For calculation time in your model it won't make a difference, but if you have a more complicated model i will probably will select carefully the proper sensor location.\n\nI'm not sure what do you call Heat Waste, but light in E+ also represent a source of heat (internal heat gain, such as the equipment) that will affect the Heating/Cooling loads.\n\n\n\nGood luck,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 5, 2015 at 9:13am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nI'm not focused today.\n\nI see that you picked just a couple of points for the anuual daylight simulation.
