{"body": "\nDear expert,\n\nI have tried to create a simple building with variable orientation and variable glazing ratio in order to show the effect of this variables on internal illuminace.<br/>To do this I have already a geometry that I have converted in a HBsurfaces, then in one of this surfaces I have added a window with variable glazing ratio. <br/>Although the simulation run with reliable results (illuminance decrease with the glazing ratio at fixed orientation) I am not sure that it is the right way to do this,<br/> in fact I am not able to change the window characteristic, and if I try to separate the window from the wall with decomposeByType component it isn't works. <br/> <br/>So, how I can separate the window from the HBsurface as shown in the 004_HB example?\n\n<br/>Cheers,<br/>Giuseppe\n\nPS: Maybe the problem is more clear if you check in the attachment the .gh file.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1135147", "name": "luna_01.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "September 21, 2014 at 2:54pm", "created_by": "GiuseppeDM", "topic": "Glazing ratio on HBsurface", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Giuseppe,\n\nI checked the attached file but Rhino geometries are not internalized.

You are right. We don't really have a clean way of doing this. Maybe we should add a component to let the user change glazing materials for either a HBSrf or a HBZone.\n\nFor now you can generate the surface by component decompose the brep, regenrate HBSurfaces and run the analysis. Not a clean methodology at all but it should work until I add the component that I mentioned.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/26rh2i2B5Mb3WDSTRVjepOAnC-eMOTDqb1j-QpJu5G4xqowv3c-42kjGAfqeI2rk8llpHfJhxLaNZWH2vL8Zgg9xDeGAe453/changeGlazingMaterial.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/26rh2i2B5Mb3WDSTRVjepOAnC-eMOTDqb1j-QpJu5G4xqowv3c-42kjGAfqeI2rk8llpHfJhxLaNZWH2vL8Zgg9xDeGAe453/changeGlazingMaterial.png)\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1135842", "name": "changeGlazingMaterial.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 22, 2014 at 7:33pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nAnd here the attachment!!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1135556", "name": "luna_01.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "September 22, 2014 at 10:15am", "created_by": "GiuseppeDM", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nChecked your file and my guess was true.
