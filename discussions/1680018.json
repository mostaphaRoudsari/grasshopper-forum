{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nWonder how the design flow rate in the ZoneMixing block is calculated?\n\nFound in the HB_HB a Flow Rate of 0.0963, but can't find where the calculation is done.\n\nTrying to check multiplying by the area or dividing by the volume don't give me the input number in the idf.\n\nCan you shed some light here?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 28, 2017 at 10:05am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "Design Flow Rate in ZoneMixing", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi,\n\nIt's been a while since i asked this ...\n\nIn the meantime i've found this [discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interzone-airflow-rate-for-a-large-volume). From that and from seeing the HB_setEPNatVent interZoneAirFlowRate_ input it is correct to say that the calculation is 0.0963 multiplied for the area of the air wall? With this the numbers fit, but just want to be sure.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 9, 2017 at 1:11pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}]}
