{"body": "\nHello Everyone,\n\nI am doing basic LB radiation and sunlight hours analysis on a project for multiple days (21 - march, june, sept, dec). The model is quite big and takes about 3 hrs to run the radiation esp. at the desired grid density.\n\nMy question is that is there a way I can save the results for future editing purposes. In simple terms I want to use Legend Parameters to change the display (gradient, low high bounds, etc.) when required. I have been searching on the forum but could not find anything.\n\nWhat I tried is to bake the mesh and re-select it in gh, copied the sunlight hours results for that mesh in excel and pasted them back in a fresh panel... plugged the mesh and the results panel in custom preview with a gradient.... but the preview doesn't seem to match the original results mesh (test sample attached).\n\n\n\nSo is there any way I can save my analysis results and use it in future to process as required. I don't want to re run the analysis every time.\n\n\n\nThanks!!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1662633", "name": "sample comparision.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Saket Sarupria", "created_at": "December 25, 2016 at 10:49am", "created_by": "SaketSarupria", "topic": "Save LB Radiation Results for future manipulation", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Saket,\n\nDid you try using native grasshopper Data component? You can provide your results / mesh to a Data component and then internalize the data for future use. You can internalize data by right clicking. You can save results for every iteration this way.\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "December 25, 2016 at 10:58am", "created_by": "devang", "replies": [{"body": "\nYes I did.
