{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI got a question relate to ASHRAE 90.1-2010 Wall Construction from the EP Construction Library. I found out that the U-value from the EP Library does not match with ASHRAE 90.1-2010 exactly (for example, for Climate zone 1 Extmass Wall, EP Library offers U=0.649, whereas ASHRAE requires max 0.580 using IP Units).\u00a0\n\nThe other question is that is the library updated to ASHRAE 20.1-2013?\n\nThanks!\n\nBest,\n\nRufei\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rufei Wang", "created_at": "April 4, 2016 at 12:16pm", "created_by": "RufeiWang", "topic": "ASHRAE 90.1 Wall Construction", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Rufei,\n\nThanks for reporting this.

Now I understand why the EP Construction has a higher U-value than the code. But I got one question for ASHRAE 90.1-2010 Extwall Mass Climate zone 7-8, the U-value is 0.054, but the code is 0.071, should I change R-16.84 to R-11.2 in order to make a U-value of 0.075?\u00a0\n\nBest,<br/>Rufei\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rufei Wang", "created_at": "April 5, 2016 at 8:05am", "created_by": "RufeiWang", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThanks for your reply!
