{"body": "\nhey,\n\nguys. I'm a new beginner for grasshopper. I tried to follow the youtube tutorial considering honeybee modelling, but when I use adjacency solving I found it could not split the walls overlapped.\n\nhere is the photo I checked for outdoor walls and surfaces(interior walls):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0smQHvjc5TfsouqwNUA79TtmDZfPR0OmV9fH39ZGPvBsghQ4ewJPi4gIzgkfrAF*x0ZGiSkYtxem*mtWczU3zUeMZa83EEtD/ZRJUZMAMZQLRW4DM.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0smQHvjc5TfsouqwNUA79TtmDZfPR0OmV9fH39ZGPvBsghQ4ewJPi4gIzgkfrAF*x0ZGiSkYtxem*mtWczU3zUeMZa83EEtD/ZRJUZMAMZQLRW4DM.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0smQHvjc5TcLQFc6RaarhzZ*dCs2rk*KVFgJuj*z9UECKP3Cqfx3FZqxxGkDTBx*6aZJ7OxoTworvGXqjyBv83kqNJtnQd2-/K2EQW6UGMDZYBULCW.png\" width=\"690\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0smQHvjc5TcLQFc6RaarhzZ*dCs2rk*KVFgJuj*z9UECKP3Cqfx3FZqxxGkDTBx*6aZJ7OxoTworvGXqjyBv83kqNJtnQd2-/K2EQW6UGMDZYBULCW.png)I'm trying to read the processing , and I found it was not like Boolean calculation. Can anyone tell me what's the problem? Or should I remake the model in a specific way ?\n\nthank u .\n\n\n\nI upload the gh files.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1471830", "name": "testified outwalls.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chryl Lee", "created_at": "February 25, 2016 at 9:31pm", "created_by": "ChrylLee", "topic": "Solve Adjacencies problems", "replies": [{"body": "\nhi, it's me again, I fixed it up by modifying a little on the rhino models. The component can not split the surface so we have to prepare it on rhino modeling. Now I reupload the files so someone who have the same problem can know what happens.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0smQHvjc5TfClo6safvk6WCRTt*4Nd8toM49zrJriU04DMtebU0iPl6OtiGbh*5h8W9-5zAfj9WHNfDZrvVg2UoNA4hpsalQ/X47_2S8E8ETSMT_CIQ.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0smQHvjc5TfClo6safvk6WCRTt*4Nd8toM49zrJriU04DMtebU0iPl6OtiGbh*5h8W9-5zAfj9WHNfDZrvVg2UoNA4hpsalQ/X47_2S8E8ETSMT_CIQ.png)\n\nI read the processing to know that u use \"Bang\" to explode all the surfaces. Then I'm wondering if it works when just use rhino Boolean calculation split the surfaces, so maybe we don't have to split the overlapped surfaces manually every time, especially when dealing with complicated models. I'm trying on it but maybe I'm wrong. After splitting we also have to combine each unit blocks rather than combine them together. If u know anything please teach me.\n\n\n\nThank u very much :)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1472027", "name": "testified outwalls.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chryl Lee", "created_at": "February 25, 2016 at 11:59pm", "created_by": "ChrylLee", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chryl,\n\nThanks for sharing the model. The best practice is to take care of the model in Rhino but you can also try splitMasses component.\n\nI'm not sure if I understand your question about the bang component.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 29, 2016 at 6:43am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank u !
