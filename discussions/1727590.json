{"body": "\nHello everyone;\n\nI am trying to run a radiation and daylight analysis but I can't run it and it gets a null result. I have searched a lot about this problem but I didn't find a proper solution. Can anyone help me to get rid of this problem?\n\nI have attached my algorithm here. I hope I can correct it.\n\nRegards\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1727589", "name": "960116.gh"}], "created_by_name": "leila pasandi", "created_at": "April 5, 2017 at 1:16am", "created_by": "leilapasandi", "topic": "Null Radiation and Daylight Analysis", "replies": [{"body": "\nI dont see the honeybee_honeybee and ladybug_ladybug component in your file.
