I've been referencing through the code of HB_HB based on some components but I can't seem to get how the Library works and how this new feature would fit in.\n\n\n\nI went ahead and added some code into the main HB_HB component\n\ne.g.\n\nunder the\u00a0EPObjectsAux.addEPObjectToLib method, i added\u00a0\"MaterialProperty:PhaseChange\" : \"honeybee_PhaseCHange\" to\u00a0**HBLibrarieNames** dictionary and some other things within the EPObjectsAux class, I bet that's not how it works though\n\n\n\n-----\n\nI'm also not sure if the remaining classes (\n\nMaterialProperty:VariableThermalConductivity<br/> HeatBalanceSettings:ConductionFiniteDifference<br/> HeatBalanceAlgorithm<br/> SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Inside,TARP;<br/> SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Outside,DOE-2;\n\n) should be written as a separate component... How do you usually do these things? It'd probably be impractical to have one component per class right? Ultimately, my goal is to enable parametric simulations for PCMs available in HB.\n\n\n\n----\n\nAlso, do I need to edit some things within Run EP Simulation?\n\nI noticed WriteIDF has methods such as\u00a0EPHeatBalanceAlgorithm and\u00a0EPHeatBalanceAlgorithm, although it seems they're turned off at the moment\n\n-----\n\nJust to clarify.. when the RunEP component writes the idf file.. the order the classes are written doesn't matter right? i.e.\u00a0SimulationControl can go first, it can also go last?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1663639", "name": "try-parametric-simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Pin", "created_at": "December 28, 2016 at 3:33am", "created_by": "Pin", "topic": "Developing a component for PCMs in HB, I need help + other questions", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Pin, I will hopefully get back to you with more detailed answer soon but for now, 1- the objects that you're listed, if the values are not assigned EP will use the default values. 2- The order in an idf file doesn't make a difference.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 28, 2016 at 5:44pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, I'll be back in a day or two. In the meantime I'll leave this updated definition of my attempt. Looks like the simulation took off but the results were not what I expected (I expected the surface temperatures to vary depending on the melting point of the PCM but they didn't, i.e. exactly the same values were popping up even with different melting points). I definitely went wrong somewhere.
