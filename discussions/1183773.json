{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nVery impressed with the latest Honeybee release. I'm attempting to use Honeybee to visualize surface temperature data from pre-existing EnergyPlus models. I thought I had a handle on this from watching Chris's (very informative) videos, but keep receiving an error.<br/><br/>I've run the EnergyPlus models separately, and outputted the surface data, and surface temperature data in those models. My idea was to use the \"import_idf\" function to get the honeybee zones, and \"read_ep_surface_results\" for the temperature data. When connecting these items to the \"color_surfaces_by_ep_results\", i get the following\n\n**error:\u00a01. Solution exception:unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'**\n\nAny advice as to where this error comes from? or if this technique will even accomplish what I hope?\u00a0<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Stefan\n\n**<br/>[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/oj4MhhoM4fTgNnAI8PjXCzswRUvVJaeEsDxUWba*0nxuO841oXyJu6WR9I96qGv1EDTEaIGKNQDMm1JbimQnKmjssXwtmCWp/Capture.GIF?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/oj4MhhoM4fTgNnAI8PjXCzswRUvVJaeEsDxUWba*0nxuO841oXyJu6WR9I96qGv1EDTEaIGKNQDMm1JbimQnKmjssXwtmCWp/Capture.GIF)<br/>**\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183772", "name": "ImportIDF_viewTemperatures.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Stefan Gracik", "created_at": "December 8, 2014 at 3:56pm", "created_by": "StefanGracik", "topic": "Visualize EnergyPlus results with Honeybee", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Stefan,\n\nCan you also update, idf and csv files so we can reproduce what you have up there?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 8, 2014 at 4:31pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "replies": [{"body": "\nHey Mostapha!
