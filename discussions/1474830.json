{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am running a simple EP (v8.3)\u00a0simulation with ideal air loads and noticed that I was getting some latent cooling loads even though I have not set any humidity limits in the EPzonethresholds component.\n\nLooking at the IDF, I noticed that all humidity settings under HVACTemplate:Zone:IdealLoadsAirSystem were left blank; which I took to mean no humidity controls were set up. I was wrong! EP was somewhat setting a maximum\u00a0absolute humidity in the supply air, hence the latent cooling loads I got in the results.\n\nI then went on to try and manually edit the IDF and put 'None' under Dehumidification Control Type. This resolved the issue and my supply air humidity is allowed to fluctuate to saturation (and only then there is some dehumidification)\n\n\n\nAlthough I am not very familiar with coding, looking at the runEnergySimulation component, I think I small change in the code may resolve the issue to make sure that 'None' is specified if humidity limits are not set (see below). Hope this works!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noriginal code\n\n<font color=\"#008000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#008000\" size=\"2\">#Humidity Control</font></font>\n\n**<font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\">if</font></font>** <font size=\"2\">zone.humidityMax !=</font> <font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">\"\"</font></font><font size=\"2\">: dehumidCntrl =</font> <font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">\"Humidistat\"</font></font>\n\n**<font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\">else</font></font>**<font size=\"2\">: dehumidCntrl =</font> <font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">\"\"</font></font>\n\n**<font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\">if</font></font>** <font size=\"2\">zone.humidityMin !=</font> <font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">\"\"</font></font><font size=\"2\">: humidCntrl =</font> <font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">\"Humidistat\"</font></font>\n\n**<font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\">else</font></font>**<font size=\"2\">: humidCntrl =</font> <font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">\"\"</font></font>\n\n\n\n<font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">suggested change</font></font>\n\n<font color=\"#008000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#008000\" size=\"2\">#Humidity Control</font></font>\n\n**<font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\">if</font></font>** <font size=\"2\">zone.humidityMax !=</font> <font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">\"\"</font></font><font size=\"2\">: dehumidCntrl =</font> <font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">\"Humidistat\"</font></font>\n\n**<font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\">else</font></font>**<font size=\"2\">: dehumidCntrl =</font> <font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">\"None\"</font></font>\n\n**<font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\">if</font></font>** <font size=\"2\">zone.humidityMin !=</font> <font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">\"\"</font></font><font size=\"2\">: humidCntrl =</font> <font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">\"Humidistat\"</font></font>\n\n**<font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#0000FF\" size=\"2\">else</font></font>**<font size=\"2\">: humidCntrl =</font> <font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\"><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"2\">\"None\"</font></font>\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Gustavo B", "created_at": "March 1, 2016 at 5:43am", "created_by": "GustavoB", "topic": "Ideal Air Humidity Control settings missing", "replies": [{"body": "\nGustavo,\n\nThanks for realizing this and reporting. \u00a0I added in the ability for humidity control with the ideal air system a couple of weeks ago. \u00a0However, I failed to realize that the default humidity control when the field is left blank is not \"None\" as I would expect but \"ConstantSensibleHeatRatio\". \u00a0I agree that it should be none if no humidity setpoints are assigned.\n\nI have changed this to now be \"None\" as you suggest:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/9339858dad6048a...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/9339858dad6048abf7e21eaae5ea6609bfeb15c7)\n\n\n\nFind updated components on the github and in this file:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=EnergyPlus_Simulation&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1.319507910772895&amp;offset=-139.9714290580057,-81.51694793242791)\n\n\n\nThanks again for finding this!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 1, 2016 at 7:37pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks Chris!\n\nAnd BTW, brilliant work from you and all others at LB/HB.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Gustavo B", "created_at": "March 2, 2016 at 2:37am", "created_by": "GustavoB", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\nHi Gustavo,\n\nI've the same problem.
