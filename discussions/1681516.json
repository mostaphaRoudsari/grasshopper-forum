{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI'm currently doing a quick project study on the use of a transparent canopy for a train station. I want to analyse the outdoor thermal comfort under a large canopy that will either be designed as an opaque metal roof, a 20% transparent integrated glass PV roof or a 100% transparent glass roof.\n\n\n\nI seem to have immense difficulty in finding some way of making the shading context transparent! I would like to initially look at the radiation analysis in Ladybug, but I can't test the 20% transparent option for the context (even in trying to use the HB object shading surface).\n\n\n\nI have played around with the example files for the outdoor microclimate map, and the urban microclimate, both of which do not seem to work.\n\n\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated as we are hoping for some preliminary results before the end of the week!!\n\n\n\nKind Regards\n\nElly\n\n\n\nPS. below are the files which I am working from - none of which I can get working well.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1681514", "name": "Solar Radiation Analysis.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1681515", "name": "UTCI Testing.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 30, 2017 at 7:30pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Transparent Material Analysis", "replies": [{"body": "", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 1, 2017 at 6:46am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you for your response! These look great, though for some reason I'm throwing up errors with Openstudio. Do you know what might be wrong here with this error message?
