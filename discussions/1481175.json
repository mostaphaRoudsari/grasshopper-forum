{"body": "\nHey HB &amp; LB community!\n\n\n\nI have a question regarding the display of results done by \"Recolour mesh\" component.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen exporting results I like to blur the results, bake the colour mask into Rhino and then export it together with a plan drawing. When saving to PDF I normally export the plan with a vector style linework (lines are displayed better) and the mesh as raster, since the it cannot be exported as a vector.\n\n\n\nIs there another way that I can export a mesh as a vector from Rhino? Or maybe blur a hatch, since Rhino allows me to export as a vector?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n//Mihail\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mihail Todorov", "created_at": "March 10, 2016 at 7:29am", "created_by": "MihailTodorov", "topic": "Recolour mesh result export as a vector style linework", "replies": [{"body": "\nLook at the new bakeIt options in the component.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 10, 2016 at 8:15am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nYes, I checked them.
