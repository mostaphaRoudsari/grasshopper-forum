{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI'm currently doing a solar radiation analysis for a train station, whereby we want to measure the solar radiation at each measurement point for every hour in the 'extreme hot week' analysis period.\n\n\n\nI am taking the approach to run the analysis via Honeybee Radiance, however I cannot find an output that will provide me broken down hourly information for each test point. I find that the genCumulativesky component lets me look at that specific period, but provides a cumulative result of radiation across the period. If I try the climate based sky, I can specify only ONE hour.\n\n\n\nI am tempted to parametrically run the climate based to simulate for every hour during this week, however it seems pretty extensive to do this.\n\n\n\nI am currently running an annual simulation, however the outputs only seem to be illuminance, not radiation.\n\n\n\nAm I missing some form of workflow/sky that I could use that could spit out hourly solar radiation data? It seems quite a simple request which makes me believe it must already exist, but I can't find it =/\n\n\n\nAny help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "February 6, 2017 at 8:16pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "WISH: Hourly radiation data from Radiance for a given period", "replies": [{"body": "\nElzine,\n\nLB has the possibility of showing single hours radiation results.\n\nAttached an example i use for class.
