Specially people need to pay attention to the prerequisites (virtualization). Second of all, in case you uninstall and reinstall, before the later, be sure you delete the c:\\users\\YOUR_USER_NAME\\.docker and .VirtualBox. It took me 3 installations and 2 uninstalls to make it work.\n\nNow i have a question not related to the thread. Once i get the results, how can i use them without running again. This is a very dumb question, but i don't see the right component and input to do so.\n\nAnd another thing. It is me or after the simulation is done (in the BF_simpleFoam) the GH canvas is behaving slowish? You can sense it pretty much.\n\n\n\nHagit: Not stuck :-). It is working. Tomorrow i'll try the outdoor example, which i see is your case.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 23, 2016 at 3:28pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1585226"}
