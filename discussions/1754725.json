{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and group members,\n\n\n\nIs it possible to simplify the setting process of construction u-value with a series of u-value numbers rather than a range of detailed settings \u00a0in order to\u00a0accelerate the process of conceptual design process?\n\n\n\nBecause for the designers, especially architects in the conceptual stage, the u-value of constructions such as walls, roof and floor, and the u-value and SHGC of window may draw more attentions. And of course, we can make a range of constructions from **Honeybee_Call from EP Construction Library**, but the interval of constructions values seems discontinuous, not enough and also limited. And is it possible for designers to find the optimal u-value of constructions and then to develop the detailed construction settings such as wall's thickness, roughness? Could find a proper solution or workflow for this thought?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n\nXiaojian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "May 19, 2017 at 9:01pm", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "topic": "Simplify the setting process of u-value", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Xioajian,\n\nThere is the NoMassOpaque Material Component found in the construction tab of Honeybee. You can plug in directly an R value there along with absorbance parameters, however, as the name implies the calculation will not take into account any thermal mass.\n\nAris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aris V", "created_at": "May 20, 2017 at 5:00am", "created_by": "ArisVartholomaios", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Aris,\n\n\n\nThank you for your great help and so sorry for my late reply.

Perhaps what you might want to do is create a custom construction and play with the thickness of the insulation material to get different U values.\n\n\n\n-Aris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aris V", "created_at": "June 27, 2017 at 1:55am", "created_by": "ArisVartholomaios", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi Aris,\n\nThank you for your great help.\u00a0\n\nIt is exactly what I want to do.
