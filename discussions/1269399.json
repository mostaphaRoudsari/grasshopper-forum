{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI was working through an automated slider run of a radiance illuminance analysis. It was running over night and was stopped for a reason I am not sure of, potentially a forced restart by windows. Now I cannot get radiance to complete a run and the octree is not being generated. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Rhino, Grasshopper, Honeybee/Ladybug, and radiance to no avail. Any ideas? Screenshot of the error below. It was running fine...Won't run on even the simplest of models. Thanks.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1269398", "name": "octree error.docx"}], "created_by_name": "Ed Clark", "created_at": "April 22, 2015 at 4:20am", "created_by": "EdClark", "topic": "Octree erroe", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Ed,\n\n\n\nHad a similar error a few days ago. If memory serves me well the error is produced when any of your surfaces do not fit in octree.\u00a0 I do not know what type of geometry you are running but if it is a building/room try to include an outside ground plane that stretches beyond your current walls/boundaries. Not sure this will fix it, as my error was a truncate error, but worth to try.\n\n\n\nAlso, perhaps uploading your definition will get you better advice from experts of the forum.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 22, 2015 at 4:35am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "replies": [{"body": "\nAlso, this issue might happen from polygons on top or near each other.
