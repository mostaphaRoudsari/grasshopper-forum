It is accepted that the\u00a0PAR radiation ranges from 400 to 700 nm (McCree, 1972), although some authors consider\u00a0the PAR from 350 to 850 nm.\u00a0\n\nThe composition of the radiation\u00a0changes with time, as a function of the Sun\u2019s\u00a0elevation and the cloudiness. When the\u00a0Sun is low over the horizon, the short\u00a0wavelengths\u00a0are reduced (less UV and more\u00a0red). The clouds reduce the amount of\u00a0energy, greatly decreasing the NIR.\n\n**The PAR\u00a0proportion in relation to the global radiation\u00a0increases with scattering (diffusion).\u00a0It is lower

ventilation will be to use the SetEPAirflow component and make a custom ventilation object (Option 2 on the NautralVentilation Type). \u00a0With this custom object, you can really take control over all of the inputs using the area of the net, the height of it, etc. \u00a0You probably want to drop down both the wind discharge coefficient and the stack discharge coefficient to account for the fact that the netting will create additional friction and slow down the air slightly. \u00a0Also, you probably want to use two\u00a0SetEPAirflow components in tandem and set the angle of the two ventilation objects to be opposite one another (to account for wind-driven cross flow). \u00a0Your final set of components should look something like this:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\"

on constructions and radiance materials, here is an image on how to assign them:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\"

what the reflectance of your film is.\n\nYou can find more info on constructions in this video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeoXlQyPxg&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeoXlQyPxg&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=18)\n\n\n\nAnd more

you want to get really deep into PAR, you will probably have to find some of your own ways of accounting for the changing color of sunlight at different angles (just the lux and radiation values won't get you accurate results in moles of photons). \u00a0You might want to check out the Ladybug_Colored Sky Visualizer to get a better sense of sky color with changing sun altitudes.\n\n\n\nHope this
