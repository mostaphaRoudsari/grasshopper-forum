{"body": "\nHey guys,\n\n\n\nIs it possible to have dynamic u-values in E+?\n\nIf I create a material with a certain conductivity and a schedule, that accounts for the changes in the conductivity over the year, how do I get E+/the honeybee components to couple the two?\n\nIf not does somebody have an alternative suggestion to account for the changes of the u-value? \u00a0\n\nThanks!,\n\n/Christian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Kongsgaard", "created_at": "December 10, 2015 at 4:21am", "created_by": "ChristianKongsgaard", "topic": "Dynamic U-values in E+ and Honeybee", "replies": [{"body": "\nThis is a very interesting question and I don't know the answer to it.
