{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI'm really happy to see the natural ventilation component in the latest release of Honeybee. \u00a0I am curious about how it works and the best way to model a mixed mode system. \u00a0Is there a way to simulate open windows when the outdoor temperature is in the comfort range and couple that with supplemental mechanical conditioning (with closed windows) when the exterior temperature is outside of that range?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nGeoffrey\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Geoffrey Becker", "created_at": "February 16, 2015 at 4:03pm", "created_by": "GeoffreyBecker", "topic": "Natural and Mixed Mode Ventilation", "replies": [{"body": "\nGeoffrey,\n\nThe answer to your question is yes. \u00a0You probably want to use the Nat vent component in combination with the set zone thresholds component to make sure that you don't accidentally turn the cooling system on while the windows are open. \u00a0The following will have occupants open windows any time the indoor temperature goes above 22 C and shut the windows any time that either the indoor or outdoor temperature is above 28 C. \u00a0If the indoor temperature goes above 28 C, the cooling system will come on to ensure that the temperature does not rise any further.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/wdDZeipuIRxqtaNBwtj11CBhVjNK7WLa8qyBDCvb4e3Yzys4lXmbyyjHPeB*Q1hW7Ht6Mvy9R-UKtUBpYsQdEyZOzG5lSQry/MidexMode.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/wdDZeipuIRxqtaNBwtj11CBhVjNK7WLa8qyBDCvb4e3Yzys4lXmbyyjHPeB*Q1hW7Ht6Mvy9R-UKtUBpYsQdEyZOzG5lSQry/MidexMode.PNG)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 18, 2015 at 5:31pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}], "id": "1225855"}
