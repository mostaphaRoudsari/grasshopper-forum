I fixed it in the attached GH file so that you can get those specific Zone-level outputs if you want them instead of what I have suggested above.\n\n3) There is currently not a component to read meter outputs mostly because this information would be misleading with the 'Run Energy Simulation' and it use of an ideal air heating/cooling system. \u00a0The energy from ideal air systems is not factored in meter outputs and you need to specify a complete, real HVAC system for such thermal outputs to affect things like meter electricity or meter fuel. \u00a0Now that development is picking up on the OpenStudio component, which can write these complete HVAC systems, we will eventually have a new result reader that parses the E+ SQL output (including meter outputs).\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1330855", "name": "tut_test_v016_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 22, 2015 at 5:47pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nHi, Chris, thank you very much for your detailed explanation and the fix of the component!\n\n\n\nHowever, I still got the following issue with the updated \"Read EP Result\" component:\n\n\n\n1. even when the normByFloorArea is set as False, the caption for the zone heating loads visualization still shows \"floor normalized heating energy\" (see image 1 and 2) below\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/aNZ9EZ3f4*yASW2U8D405fcYkNvfXiH2LUx6*sv4IbeXQ76ph7yK3TYVggehA1q-WtnLiVcwmDsK0lGsWB*UiNAntiPB0ZD8/01.JPG\" width=\"578\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/aNZ9EZ3f4*yASW2U8D405fcYkNvfXiH2LUx6*sv4IbeXQ76ph7yK3TYVggehA1q-WtnLiVcwmDsK0lGsWB*UiNAntiPB0ZD8/01.JPG)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/aNZ9EZ3f4*z-g28EvqQoDx21JBod68mAo5BalZY0utKzhj7-RORu8wXIC6avvubezr4Ex9*bPxBGeP3KBySN2IfK3elNLLJ2/02.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/aNZ9EZ3f4*z-g28EvqQoDx21JBod68mAo5BalZY0utKzhj7-RORu8wXIC6avvubezr4Ex9*bPxBGeP3KBySN2IfK3elNLLJ2/02.JPG)\n\n2.
