{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI'm using both Honeybee and Ladybug for running multiple iterations of energy simulation. During the calculation process, sometimes Daysim will crash, thereby causing the \"Honeybee_Run Daylight Simulation\" component to give errors while the other components for both Radiance and Energy Plus running properly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nColin mentioned to me earlier that this problem had happened before, does anyone have clues yet what might be causing the problem?\n\n\n\np.s. I'm using EnergyPlus-8.4.0. Sometimes reruning the\u00a0\"Honeybee_Run Daylight Simulation\" component will fix the problem, but it seems like impossible while \"Ladybug_fly\" component just keeps running the calculation running one after another even if Daysim crashes.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1562494", "name": "LBHB Bug.png"}], "created_by_name": "Hanshen Sun", "created_at": "July 8, 2016 at 1:27pm", "created_by": "HanshenSun", "topic": "Daysim crushing while running", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi HanShen,\n\n\n\nCan you post your file? I will try to recreate the issue on my machine. Unfortunately DaySim can be temperamental and thats why we are going to phase it out eventually.\n\n\n\nYou could also try reducing the number of points in your geometry to see if that still causes DaySim to crash\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "July 10, 2016 at 5:06pm", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "replies": [{"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply, I actually get it to work by switching to another computer with larger ram.
