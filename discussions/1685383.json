{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI'm glad to share some useful tools with those people who use ENVI-Met v.4.0 for their researches. (a software that is very slow but accurate enough, XD).<br/> I have written two LB components which let you visualize and manipulate data that come from ENVI-Met simulations. These component are based on a research with ENVI-Met v.3.0 and Ladybug that I did in 2015:\u00a0\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281031049_Outdoor_Comfort_...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281031049_Outdoor_Comfort_the_ENVI-BUG_tool_to_evaluate_PMV_values_point_by_point)\n\n\n\nIt is possible to combine LB_ENVI-Met Grid with other LB component, such as: Ladybug_Mesh Threshold Selector, Ladybug_Countour Mesh, Ladybug_Recolor Mesh,\u00a0Ladybug_Outdoor Comfort Calculator, Ladybug_Thermal Comfort Indices.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/*ix1zXEQDKMwvAa6jfbGSyXHlM8GkRvQJ-s7cihCIZsnqeifTsAjqAg5zq8rQQLNDVgpLjfXUasmHizWZ1IjZvJP*qEizJRc/LB_ENVIMet_0.png?width=650\" width=\"650\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/*ix1zXEQDKMwvAa6jfbGSyXHlM8GkRvQJ-s7cihCIZsnqeifTsAjqAg5zq8rQQLNDVgpLjfXUasmHizWZ1IjZvJP*qEizJRc/LB_ENVIMet_0.png)\n\n- Antonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "February 5, 2017 at 3:11am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "topic": "LB_ENVI-Met", "replies": [{"body": "\nExcellent Antonello!\n\nWould try these as soon as possible.

As such, you should **not** install different IronPython versions to begin with. [See more information](https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/ironpython-installation-rhino-5-rhino-wip/40927).\n\n\n\nIf required, then rather install the exact version that you are using with Rhino, or disable the **GAC option** while installing.\n\n\n\nBesides, \\N is not a good character escape. It should be \\n. \\n is a new line escape. [\\N is undefined](https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html), even in Python 2.0, and as such, can create issues.
