{"body": "\nHi\n\nI just tried to calculate the heating &amp; cooling loads, using ladybug, but it is not working.\n\nI have checked all the geometries used and I believe it is a simple mass.\n\nWhen I run the \"simulation\", it seems that it tries to calculates but after all it is not working.\n\nthe message says \"1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> ** Severe ** Problem in interior solar distribution calculation (CHKBKS)\"\n\nit will be highly appreciated if any of you can have a look and help to resolve this problem.\n\nThank you\n\nBest\n\nJohn\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1781979", "name": "2-Energy Model_w.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1781980", "name": "2017-07-11_18-32-13.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "john chun", "created_at": "July 11, 2017 at 3:33am", "created_by": "johnchun", "topic": "I have a problem with running open studio", "replies": [{"body": "\nThis has been discussed recently. Search for \"air wall\".<br/> But as alternative solution i added a HB_EnergySimPar component and set the solarDistribution_ input to 1 (Full Exterior) instead of the default (Full Exterior and Interior). The last one don't like convex zones, but still is giving you results. They can be good enough even though the error. The setting that i gave here is less strict, takes direct beam only.<br/> See green groups in the attached.<br/>\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 11, 2017 at 4:34am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": [{"body": "\nAnd now the file.<br/> -A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1782079", "name": "2EnergyModel_w_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 11, 2017 at 4:40am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "replies": []}, {"body": "\nthank you very much for your help and explanation! \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "john chun", "created_at": "July 11, 2017 at 3:37pm", "created_by": "johnchun", "replies": []}]}], "id": "1781981"}
