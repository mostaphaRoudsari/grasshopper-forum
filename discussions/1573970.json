{"body": "\nI need to run annual glare simulations for 200 views, so I decided to create a large amazon server with 16 CPUs. I entered 16 in the number of CPUs input in the daylighting\u00a0simulation\u00a0component and I ran the simulation. I opened the server's resource moniter\u00a0and found out that rcpict\u00a0is using only 6 CPUs. Am I missing something? Do I need to change anything else in the daylighting simulation component to make Radiance use all 16 CPUs.\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "July 31, 2016 at 9:17pm", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "topic": "Testing annual glare simulation on a server with 16 CPUs", "replies": [{"body": "\nThis is already replied in a different discussion.
