{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI am modeling a room to find out the best dimensions of the window in south elevation,\n\nPrincipally, in a specific WWR (window to wall ratio), There must be a balance between thermal energy and electric light, but in all conditions, the cooling load is much higher than heating and electric energy, I tested the algorithm for winter and again the cooling was higher than heating! I changed the materials but it was ineffective.\n\nWhat's the problem? Did I make mistake somewhere in writing the algorithm?\n\nThanks,\n\nFahimeh\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1349291", "name": "4-1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Fahimeh Motazedian", "created_at": "August 26, 2015 at 10:29am", "created_by": "FahimehMotazedian", "topic": "Unusual High cooling loads", "replies": [{"body": "\nFahimeh,\n\n\n\nIts possible for a space to be in a cooling mode during the winter. E+\u00a0balances the following loads:\n\n-solar heat gain\n\n-heat transfer through the glass\n\n-heat transfer through all other facades\n\n-internal program loads (people, plug loads, electric lighting, etc.)\n\n-infiltration\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe heat transfer through the glass/faced and infiltration will be positive or negative depending on the exterior condition, but the internal loads and solar gain will always be positive. If the internal loads and solar loads are greater than the fa\u00e7ade heat transfer and infiltration loss, you will need to cool the space.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI recommend reviewing each of the loads listed above, particularly the internal loads settings. It is likely that one of these is too high, resulting in cooling all year.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "August 26, 2015 at 10:46am", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "replies": [{"body": "\nLeland said it all.

To me that actually makes sense in most cases the smaller the windows the less energy used as the U-value of windows is (usually) much higher than surrounding walls.\n\n\n\nAs you will see the U-value of your window is 3.6 while the U-value of your wall is 0.38 smaller than a tenth of the U-value of the window. Given these materials I would think that even with no windows (and lighting required all the time) less energy would be used than having windows.\n\n\n\nWhat is the minimum WWR required for building codes in Tehran? Or what is the minimum natural day lighting that you think would be suitable?
