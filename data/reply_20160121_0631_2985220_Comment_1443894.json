{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\n\n\nYes you are right unfortunately there is not much we can do at the moment. The best work around that I can come up with at present is simply copying working breps and putting them into the place of the breps that don't work. I've attached the file here.\n\n\n\nI'll contact Rhino and get their thoughts on the issue. Chris thinks it may be a tolerance issue which should be fixed in Rhino 6.\n\n\n\nand I just love your display picture. Im a rodent fan haha.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1443895", "name": "typology_v011Copy2 AJZ.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "January 21, 2016 at 06:31AM", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1456235", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1443894"}
