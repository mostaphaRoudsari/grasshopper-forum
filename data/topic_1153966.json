{"body": "\nHey there!\n\nFirst of all, congratulations to your outstanding work! Just found out about Ladybug and Honeybee yesterday and I'm pretty excited to get into it...\n\nI've come across some minor difficulties with installing LBHB. Well, the installation worked well but the OpenstudioMasterTemplate didn't download, which I resolved by looking through some threads here in the group. Thanks for that!\n\nSo I've got one issue left. As I usually install all my simulation-related applications in my C:\\Simulation\\ directory, Honeybee can't find Radiance and EnergyPlus. Is there a way to tell HB where to look for those? Or do I have to install the tools in the default location (C:\\)? (Which is not my preferred method).\n\nI think Mostapha posted a link to the OpenStudio Website regarding this issue, but they recently changed it, so the link is not working anymore.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated :)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Albert Pressler", "created_at": "October 22, 2014 at 2:05pm", "created_by": "AlbertPressler", "topic": "EnergyPlus Installation Path", "id": "topic_1153966"}
