{"body": "\nTim and Mostapha,\n\nThis is something that has been in the works for a while:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/251](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/251)\n\nI had been meaning to implement it on all components but I only got around to implementing it for the 3D chart and the Sunpath before I realized that Mostapha was re-writing the Ladybug codebase. \u00a0I thought that I should wait for this basic re-writing to be finished before implementing it on all components since I would have to re-do all of this work in a few months if I started to do it immediately.\n\nMostapha, when do you think we will do a release of Ladybug for Grasshopper with the new code base? \u00a0If it is still several months away, perhaps I should just implement this tree-branched LegendPar on the rest of the components now. Otherwise, set a deadline and I will put forward all of my efforts to meeting it instead.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 19, 2016 at 3:11pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1488169", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1488531"}
