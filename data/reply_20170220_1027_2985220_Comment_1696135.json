{"body": "\nSolon,\n\nYour file has a basic definition error. You defined the surface type of a wall as Window. See red group in the image below. The input needs to be o instead of 5. Another issue you had is connceting a window construction to the same wall. I disconnected (so now it has a default construction) and connected it to the HB_addHBGlz (see blue line).\n\nI also rebuilt those surfaces (so they are not trimmed) but at the end there is no need for that. But just in case i left the, so you can get the idea from the image.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/NxE20jujyI*hJWcefshkP3K9bFBSt0d-sa7pIcR*cHEskMc3A05msKWh2CKKTvRQbhqopCffN1kQj1U21NeQ7korwqHn4Ops/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NxE20jujyI*hJWcefshkP3K9bFBSt0d-sa7pIcR*cHEskMc3A05msKWh2CKKTvRQbhqopCffN1kQj1U21NeQ7korwqHn4Ops/Capture.JPG)After those changes it runs fine.\n\nBTW, i would not define a door as you did. There is a native door definition in E+, and it is a child subsurface, just as the windows.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 20, 2017 at 10:27AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1695776", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1696135"}
