{"body": "\nHi Rania,\n\nFrom the discussions that you have posted in the last couple of days, it sounds like you underwent an update from the latest stable release to the version of the github. \u00a0Generally speaking, you should make sure that all of the components on your canvass are of the same version to ensure that everything runs smoothly. \u00a0If you use the updateThisFile_ option on the \"Update Honyebee\" or \"Update Ladybug\" components, you can update your whole GH file to the same version at once but be warned that it does not work for all components. \u00a0In the case that we have changed the names of the inputs/outputs or added inputs/outputs, you will have to replace the component manually (dragging them onto the canvass as it sounds like you did here). \u00a0Hopefully, this will save you some time in the future.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 28, 2015 at 11:47pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1233689", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1233796"}
