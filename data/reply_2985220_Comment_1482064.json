{"body": "\nHi Scott,<br/><br/>The vertical panels are tiny little bit angled (0.00033 to 0.00047 degrees). This is a normal thing happening during modeling.<br/>It was my mistake for not accounting for these kind of small tolerances. [It has been fixed now](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/pull/240).<br/><br/>I attached below the newest \"Ladybug_Ladybug\" component which incorporates fixing of this issue.<br/><br/>Once again thank you for finding this bug. Because of people like you, Ladybug+Honeybee project gets more and more reliable each day.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1482065", "name": "PVanalysis2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "March 11, 2016 at 2:10am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1481637", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1482064"}
