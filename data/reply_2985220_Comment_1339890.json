{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI have the following issues to get your advice:\n\n\n\n1. the maskedCrvsOnSky and maskedSrfOnGround generated from Shading_Mask_II don't match the masked surface on sky generated by Shading_Mask\n\n\n\n2. the view point cannot be set as the centroid of the window, otherwise the window surface itself or the wall surface will block the view point completely. Therefore, the view point on window or a vertical surface needs to be set slightly away from the surface. However, this will make the top edge of the window surface visible on the mask visualized on sky, no matter on small the distance btw the view point and window surface is ...\n\n\n\nhope you can kindly advise!\n\nThanks!\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/qUZbsOiEeqk5r7sdR*i-5I-yiUjYtmPzNufLolrfWQJLmZ8xh70josXRCbUC2hYT9RHgeSBVxjQEKg2jvtlJllcNRVHhc0Ly/Capture.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/qUZbsOiEeqk5r7sdR*i-5I-yiUjYtmPzNufLolrfWQJLmZ8xh70josXRCbUC2hYT9RHgeSBVxjQEKg2jvtlJllcNRVHhc0Ly/Capture.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1339891", "name": "ShadowMask_ZJ.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 8, 2015 at 1:25am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1343374", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1339890"}
