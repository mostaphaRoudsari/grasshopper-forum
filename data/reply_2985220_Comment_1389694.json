{"body": "\nOkay. I thought of going OpenStudio or Stadic ([the Penn State project](http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2015-philadelphia/presentations/day1/STADICUtilities-Radiance%20Workshop2015.pdf)) route too but I am not likely to learn a whole lot for myself that way. It's great to know that you've made progress on that.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions on how to handle perl files in a Honeybee environment? I usually do something like [\"c:\\radiance\\perl\\bin\\perl.exe\",\"c:\\radiance\\bin\\genkelmsamp.pl\" ....] when I do this in pure python and subprocess but that doesn't seem to be the right or stablest approach in Grasshopper/Honeybee. It also tends to fail when the folder structure is relative instead of absolute ( I guess that can be fixed by specifying a cwd upfront).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "October 30, 2015 at 1:30pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1389687", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1389694"}
