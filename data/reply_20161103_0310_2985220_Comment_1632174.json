{"body": "\nHi djordje,\n\n\n\nSo sorry for not make my issue clear.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAfter the study of relevant posts and operation of your uploaded gh files, I got some knowledge about your component:\n\n1. parametric surface--**Sunpath Shading**--**DC to AC derate Factor**--**Photovoltaics Module**, can calculate the ACenergy of different pv arrays by Galapagos. The process can evaluate the self shading from the input **analysisGeometry** and surrounding shading from the input **context**.\n\n2. **PV SWH Systemsize**, can also do that, but there would be no second type of self shading for the chosen **minimalSpacingPeriod_** criteria.\n\n3. **TOF** outputs optimal angle and azimuth.\n\n\n\nSo my question is, if I choose to make a curved roof to form a best pv array with best ACenergy, whether should I only choose the first above, the second PV SWH Systemsize can only deal with the angled or flat surface, not the curved? What's the relationship between **TOF** and **PV SWH Systemsize**?\n\n\n\nAlso, I'll do my best to make a parametric model as soon as possible and upload it to you, so we can make the discussion more detailed.\u00a0\n\nBest regards.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "November 03, 2016 at 03:10AM", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1631337", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1632174"}
