{"body": "\nHey Abraham,\n\n\n\nThe way I understand the concept of transmissivity is near to the one of transmittance, that is how much incident light the window allows to pass through. I am in no way an expert, but I understand transmittance is used in most glass specifications (VLT) while transmissivity is a value used in Radiance (my limits of knowledge in optics lol). There is actually an approximation of transmissivity from VLT numbers, which is transmissivity=1.09*(visible light transmittance). I feel 0.8 would be the fraction of light allowed, so it would need to be much lower to 'simulate' blinds (if blinds have a transmittance of close to 0). Perhaps what it can be used is the weighted average of the visible area of the window, with a transmittance x, to the area of the blinds (with a transmittance of 0?). Even if this is correct it would be faulty I think. Actually now I am curious to know what calculations are happening when we connect the shading breps. Are they assumed to have a transmissivity of 0?\n\n\n\nFor your second point, I am interested to hear Chris's thoughts.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 18, 2015 at 11:42PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1227174", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1227264"}
