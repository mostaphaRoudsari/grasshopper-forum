{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nI used the animation property of the sliders for something similar in the past but I am not sure how much it is reliable. In some cases (didn't try to understand when and why honestly) giving an input of x frames then I found in the image folder a different number (+1 or -1 don't remember) of images.\n\nBy the way the definition is huge but it's quite easy to make and there is a certain degree of automation (maybe not that much in this I posted but in a more recent one) for example when creating one different radFileName each simulation.\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "April 23, 2015 at 04:44AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279602", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1270976"}
