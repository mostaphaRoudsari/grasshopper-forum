{"body": "\nLeland,\n\nI don't know the answer to your first radiance question but I do know that you can get our most updated version of the components by syncing with the github. \u00a0The process for this is a bit convoluted these days since Github has stopped allowing automatic downloads but here are the steps for the best way if you don't plan on updating frequently:\n\n1) Download a copy of our code to your computer by going here ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug)) and clicking on 'download ZIP.'\n\n2) Unzip the file and you should see one folder called userObjects. All of the files in here will be most up-to-date LB userObjects\n\n3) Delete your old Ladybug userObjects by going to File &gt; Special Folders &gt; User Objects Folder in the GH window and deleting all of the LB components there.\n\n4) Drag the new Ladybug userObjects from the unzipped location onto your GH canvass.\n\nYour components are now up-to-date.\n\nBe wary that, if you stay up-to-date with the github, the overall version of the components might not always be as stable as that which we release at the official download link. \u00a0For Ladybug, things are pretty stable these days but just be understanding if you do this same github sync for Honeybee right now.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 10, 2014 at 8:57am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1165623", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1165585"}
