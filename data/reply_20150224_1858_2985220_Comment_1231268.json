{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nSo I got this response so far:\n\n\n\n\"The Daylighting:Controls object in EnergyPlus allows two different reference points to be used within a zone and the fraction of the total zone lighting that is controlled by each reference point and each reference point can have different illuminance setpoints. This allows some of the flexibility you may be looking for but the two reference points must be controlled the same way (continuous or stepped or continuous/off) and both share the same glare controls as well as the same schedule for what times of the day or year that daylighting controls are active (usually all the time anyway). A second option in EnergyPlus to do daylighting is available with the DElight daylighting objects which allows more reference points but it comes with several limitations described in the InputOutputReference that you should review before trying them.\"\n\n\n\nFor a starting point I would say that two reference points (which I guess mean 2 daylighting zones) should be enough. For very big zones we might as well divide. Unless the DElight objects allow more options.\n\n\n\nI know I'm being lazy, but is the option of two reference points within a zone in the components right now? If not, and if it's possible, I'd love to add it as a wish.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 24, 2015 at 06:58PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1230713", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1231268"}
