{"body": "\nHi Andres,\n\nYou are totally right! The shadow studies should be there... I have been thinking about it and there are possibilities to use the Rhino sun function to run the study on Rhino objects but it doesn't work for Grasshopper\u00a0geometries\u00a0([read more here](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/8)). I also tried Mesh/Mesh Intersection approach ([similar to this](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/sun-shadow-question?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A320346)), the result wasn't promissing at all. Not sure if there is any solid approach that I should try.\n\nThe possibility for now is to use sunlight-hours study component with sun-path and change the colors of the result. It will be slow but it will work. I will cover this is the in the tutorial.\n\n-Mostapha\n\nPS:\u00a0Can you please tell me more about your issue with customizing the colors? Thanks.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 28, 2013 at 12:44pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_798293", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_799129"}
