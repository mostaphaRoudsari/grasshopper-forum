{"body": "\nHey All,\n\nUsing the HB_Make_Adiabatic I changed a surface boundary condition from outdoors to adiabatic. Afterwards I moved the containing zone using HB_Move_HB but then I realized that the adiabatic boundary condition is lost and the surface has turned back to its previous state (outdoors).\n\nIs there any way to preserve the altered boundary conditions while moving zones? (I use HB_Move_HB in order to duplicate zones in a large model)\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nAryan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aryan Shahabian", "created_at": "June 13, 2016 at 07:46AM", "created_by": "AryanShahabian", "topic": "Boundary condition changes after moving", "id": "topic_1546685"}
