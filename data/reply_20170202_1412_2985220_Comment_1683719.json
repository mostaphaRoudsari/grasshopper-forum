{"body": "\nJust an update on the situation,\n\nThe best way I found right now is to implement several components with a 1\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C difference between indoor and outdoor temperature, but there is surely a bette way of doing this.<br/>For instance :\n\none for 25\u00b0C&gt; T(in) &gt; 23\u00b0C and T(out) &lt; 23\u00b0C\n\none for 27\u00b0C&gt; T(in) &gt; 25\u00b0C and T(out) &lt; 25\u00b0C\n\none for 29\u00b0C&gt; T(in) &gt; 27\u00b0C and T(out) &lt; 27\u00b0C\n\netc etc ...\n\n\n\nBut this is quite an ugly solution, so still wondering how we could do it in a better way ! (maybe inputing a series of temperature in one component ?)\n\n\n\nBests,\n\nA\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aurelien Keller", "created_at": "February 02, 2017 at 02:12PM", "created_by": "AurelienKeller", "parent_id": "topic_1681159", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1683719"}
