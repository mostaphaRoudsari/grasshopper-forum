{"body": "\nHi Amadeus,\n\nI also use the Beaufort scale for analyzing wind conditions and usability of open spaces.\n\nI think it should be clarified that the percentage of time related to annual data and not user defined period. This is specially important to notice for B7-8 where the mechanical influence of the wind can put people in danger.\n\nIn your example above you basically took the wind data for one month (or any desired period for that matter)? Can be the whole year?\n\nAnother point for reflection is that the epw gives only data for the more frequent wind at any specific hour, but there are other winds at the same hour that unfortunately are not taken into account. For this there is nothing to do, but good to have in mind.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 02:44PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1518872", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519068"}
