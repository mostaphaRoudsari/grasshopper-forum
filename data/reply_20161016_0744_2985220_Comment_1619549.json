{"body": "\nWhat Abraham said!\n\nIn Ladybug and Honeybee, and generally in Grasshopper, each component works only and only based on the data that is connected to the component and there are no global values. Which means you can draw the\u00a0sunpath\u00a0for a location and run the analysis for another one! If you want the radiation analysis to match the sunpath\u00a0you need to generate the sky for the exact hour. Use HOY input on selectSky component to input the hour.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 16, 2016 at 07:44AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1618828", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619549"}
