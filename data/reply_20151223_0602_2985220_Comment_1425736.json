{"body": "\nKeisei,\n\nI'll suggest two options (recently one of my students \"suffered\" the same thing):\n\nOption 1: GO to the directory where the sky matrix is calculated (usually c:\\ladybug, but check this in the output of the LB_LB component). Look for the directory with the weather station name (or so). You'll see that the file is 0 size (probably). Delete it and try activating the simulation again.\n\nOption 2: If 1 doesn't work, define another target directory in the input of the LB_LB component.\n\n\n\nHope this will work for you.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 23, 2015 at 06:02AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1425721", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1425736"}
