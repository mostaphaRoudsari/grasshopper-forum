{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI am trying to model a quite large building (77 floors) and run the simplest energy plus simulation. The model is quite simple with just mass to zones and solving adjacencies. My simulation period is for 1 day.\n\n\n\nHowever, it never runs the simulation as it gets stuck at writing an .idf file. The cpu and memory usages are quite low, which is strange but also not showing clearly if the process is really frozen.\n\n\n\nIs there really a limit to what we can simulate? Has anyone tested these limits before? Is it some option I have wrong? Can someone maybe try it running the same simulation?\n\n\n\nAlso, if I may I would also like to add a wish on the wishlist (is there such a thing? :)). Is it possible to have parallel for energy plus simulation. I believe having it in different computers is possible by writing the file in each computer and assigning periods to each. Is it possible to assign simulation periods to different cores?\n\n\n\nEdit: I tried without sizing with a .ddy same results.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1223054", "name": "Lot_185_Office.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 12, 2015 at 04:48AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Computational limitations or?", "id": "topic_1223055"}
