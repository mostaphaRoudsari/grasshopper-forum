{"body": "\nHi I am sure some people had to deal with the same problem.\n\nA project is on a site that is not near any epw data set shown on the map.\n\n[http://www.ladybug.tools/epwmap/](http://www.ladybug.tools/epwmap/)\n\nFrom what I read you are supposed to work with a data set that is no farther apart than 30-50 kilometers.\n\nI looked into this matter a bit and found that the weather data collected by korean goverment agency does not really work for TMY2 format because it is not based on 30 years and the weather records (in csv format) often does not include any of the three radiation data sets.(attached in the pdf)\n\nIn south korea it seems like softwares like ecotect and eco2 are used for environmental analysis and energy modelling, and I am thinking one of the reason is that there is lack of TMY2 data sets to work with.\n\nThere are some white papers comparing simulation results of ecotect work with DOE data (EPW), meteonorm, data collected by korean weather agency, and GBS VWS (which is apparently a dataset that uses extrapolation), and it seems like there isn't a striking difference except some spikes on values due to perhaps missing data.\n\non this\u00a0[link](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/ENU/BPA-GBSWebService/files/GUID-B82244EC-9798-4CF7-8F53-1D79B6B4A53C-htm.html)\u00a0it shows what the GBS studio data has and it seems like it has most parameters that are shown [here](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/Ladybug_Import%20epw.py)\u00a0for the ladybug.\n\nIF if could find a way to convert GBS VWS dataset into epw file format, meaning simply downloading autodesk GBS dataset as csv and use a program to create an epw file, would that give a misreading results, by principle?\n\nand one more question, in order to use butterfly, do I also need to have an epw file?\n\nThanks!\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1694838", "name": "aiktp_201303_035.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "February 19, 2017 at 02:33AM", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "topic": "[SOLVED] Non-US based project, absence of an epw file - how to work with Ladybug tools, a possible work around?", "id": "topic_1694663"}
