{"body": "\nHey there!\n\nHow can I generate windows that are set back inside the wall?\n\nWould it be possible to add a function to the \"addHBGlz\" Component for specifying the depth of the outside reveal? (the inside reveal and inside sill depth have to be entered manually anyway via the frame and divider object but that's not the case for the outside reveal).\n\nThe ExtrudeWindows component is only for the geometric representation of those as I understand it... or am I missing something here?\n\nThanks!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Albert Pressler", "created_at": "May 25, 2016 at 12:46PM", "created_by": "AlbertPressler", "topic": "Window setback / outside reveal", "id": "topic_1536388"}
