{"body": "\nOk. \u00a0Let me know if there are any issues assigned to me that I should clear up before the release.\n\nAlso, so that you know my larger plan, I am hoping to do a lot of development over January (including implementing basic natural ventilation airflow objects - not including the AFN - and all of the indoor comfort map stuff that I have been working on). \u00a0I was originally thinking that it would be good to do another release after this but, given that this development will mostly involve new features and not bug fixes, I can see it as a good idea to develop in January and have people beta-test until they find all of the bugs before releasing it with stable components.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 10, 2014 at 07:42PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184697", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1185398"}
