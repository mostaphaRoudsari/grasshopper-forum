{"body": "\nJavier,\n\nYour file almost worked well for me. The main problem was with the materials that weren't found in the file itself. I used some ASHRAE's and then the simulation ran OK. You should look at the report of the HB_runEnergySimulation. Very useful info is printed there, specially when you have problems in the IDF definition.\n\nI'm not sure if your materials/constructions are in your personal library, but (a word of wisdom) check twice you are using construction definitions for the geometry and not material definition. I have a feeling you are, from what i saw in the report i mentioned before.\n\nAfter that your file needed a \"serious\" update, specially with the comfort mapping components. Your components were pretty much out of date.\n\nI think is working fine now (of course, without checking the quality of the results).\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 22, 2015 at 1:34am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1330231", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1330107"}
