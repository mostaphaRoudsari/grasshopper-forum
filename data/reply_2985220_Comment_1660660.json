{"body": "\nJulia,\n\nYou definitely deserve the title of \"power user\" after this and your last post (both for GH and LB+HB). \u00a0You are right that we currently provide no method to get this blind hour. \u00a0However, quite amazingly, I just removed the checks on the analysisPeriod component and it seems that this ability has been in the back end all along and Mostapha must have forgotten to remove the check for this after adding the capability years ago:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ycvwLIslca4Ff6tz8M6QI70EpfzWebGG8lVTj40AZb-pq8332UuBWEQ49HyO1dEZI7XcbZMbwDmHHMoDdON4ALIbuxp*4EDQ/SingleHourOk.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ycvwLIslca4Ff6tz8M6QI70EpfzWebGG8lVTj40AZb-pq8332UuBWEQ49HyO1dEZI7XcbZMbwDmHHMoDdON4ALIbuxp*4EDQ/SingleHourOk.JPG)\n\nAll of the analysisPeriod components are using the same underlying function to slice the data so all of them should work in the same way that the attached test does. \u00a0I also checked the 3D chart, the sky matrix selector, and a few other components that accept the sliced data and everything is good. \u00a0I can't believe how long this unnecessary check must have been in there as the analysisPeriod functions have not been touched in years. \u00a0I have amended the code here:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/afe3bc4675602377...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/afe3bc467560237786be267bf9e3899cb182727a)\n\nVery glad that you two posted on this. Thank you for asking the right questions.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1660662", "name": "SameAnalysisPeriodHourTest.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 20, 2016 at 7:32pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1660270", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1660660"}
