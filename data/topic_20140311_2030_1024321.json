{"body": "\nI know some of you had issues getting RADIANCE and DAYSIM installed on your system, so here is a video that shows how you can get everything installed on your system in less than 15 minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"420\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/VSw-DYrgS68?wmode=opaque\" width=\"420\"></iframe>\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\n**PS: I forgot two things in the video:**\n\n**1. if you don't install Radiance at C:\\Radiance then you need to add the path to the system. Check this page: ([https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-start...](https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance)).**\n\n**2. You need to also install GHPython component.**\n\n**3. Radiance has been moved to github and now you can download it from this page: ([https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases](https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases)). Download the latest .exe file for Windows.**\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 11, 2014 at 08:30PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "topic": "How to get RADIANCE and Daysim installed", "id": "topic_1024321"}
