{"body": "\nHi Chris and Abraham,\n\nIt's weird, I just downloaded the user objects again and pasted them into the user objects folder. There had been some missing and now they are there and everything is working.\n\nI could have sworn that the other day when I downloaded Honeybee from food4rhino the SolveAdjacencies user object (among others) wasn't in the zip, but I just downloaded and checked it again and all components are there...\n\nAnyway, thanks for your help!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Max Marschall", "created_at": "May 02, 2017 at 08:00PM", "created_by": "MaxMarschall", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1744718", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1744305"}
