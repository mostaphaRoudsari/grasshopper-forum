{"body": "\nHelp!!\n\n\n\nI am a new user to grasshopper and ladybug, I followed all the instructions online and downloaded both honeybee and ladybug in order to perform a sun study for my roof design.\u00a0\n\nHowever, my commands always pop up orange telling me that I need a newer version of ladybug, however my version should be already the most updated version. Also it was working initially and running the sunpaths, it is when I wanted to perform the ladybug sunlight hour analysis that it stopped working. I have attached my file below.\u00a0\n\n\n\nYour help would be greatly appreciated.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1523012", "name": "weather test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sisi Yu", "created_at": "May 04, 2016 at 12:45PM", "created_by": "SisiYu", "topic": "Error: saying needing updated ladybug", "id": "topic_1523013"}
