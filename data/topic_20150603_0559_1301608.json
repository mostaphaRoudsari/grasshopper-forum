{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nmy simple office box (adiapatic walls, floors, glass facade) won't run, because of HBgenerators is not defined. Attached you'll find the gh-file and the error-report. Any advice would be very helpful.\n\nFurthermore my collected EP-Materials (import EP-materials) when get plugged into HBSurfaces E+ doesn't find them. I had a look on further posts with the same problem, but Chris' advice didn't work in my case.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1301606", "name": "HBgeneration.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1301607", "name": "error report.txt"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "June 03, 2015 at 05:59AM", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "topic": "HBgenerators is not defined - EP-Materials failing", "id": "topic_1301608"}
