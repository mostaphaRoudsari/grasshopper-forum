{"body": "Mel,\nI'll check your file soon. If you are using the most recent version of the THERM components from the github, the component should still be writing out the .thmx file. It's just giving you the warning to let you know that THERM might not like your file. Another method for checking where your geometry might not be ideal is to bake all of the ThermPlogon geometries, join them in Rhino, and use the DupBorder command to expose the naked edges. If you are getting more than one duplicated border, this is what the component is warning you about.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 11, 2016 at 06:13PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1528135", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1528430"}
