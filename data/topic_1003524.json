{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nFirst I would love to congratulate you on this great plugin ,\n\nI'm new to it and I don't know if this has been an issue before or not but I couldn't find anything about it,\n\nwhen I try to use the Shadow Study Component on a simple model of a couple of hundred faces it keeps on calculating forever ,\n\nI have a pretty powerful PC and I have used ecotect to make this which was still slow but faster than Shadow Study,\n\nAm I doing something wrong or is the component not yet ready to be used except with very low poly models.\n\n\n\nThanks In advance\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ramy Osama", "created_at": "February 5, 2014 at 8:40am", "created_by": "RamyOsama", "topic": "Shadow Study Very Slow", "id": "topic_1003524"}
