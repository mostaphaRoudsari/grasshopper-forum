{"body": "\nThat was a good overview of the options available, Aris. \u00a0Delcan, if you are mostly interested in fast simulations that model the overall UHI, then the Dragonfly connection to the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) would probably be the best. \u00a0This will warp your rural EPWs to account for UHI, given input building geometries and vegetation cover. \u00a0Most UWG simulations take less than 20 minute to run. \u00a0Here's an example file:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Urban_Weather_Generator_Workflow&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\nI will warn that you might be a little disappointed to find that the UHI effect is really very small. \u00a0It's almost an order of magnitude smaller than the changes that are all in store for us by 2050 with projected global warming. \u00a0Still, its useful to understand this and account for it when possible.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 25, 2017 at 10:43PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1719022", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1720875"}
