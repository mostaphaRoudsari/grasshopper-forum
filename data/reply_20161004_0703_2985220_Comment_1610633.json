{"body": "\nFrancesco,\n\nIt's quite an effort to add these capabilities into the psychromteric chart now but I will definitely keep this in mind as I work on the new version of the component for the [revised version of Ladybug](https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/ladybug). \u00a0I'll also mention that Abraham has a bioclimatic chart in WIP, which really should be a part of the main components. \u00a0It's essentially the last chart with the axes flipped (although it is not yet using the PMV model to generate the comfort polygon and using rules of thumb at the moment).\n\nI have been thinking about how an operative temperature plot would work. \u00a0I have to ask Tyler Hoyt how he deals with cases in the CBE tool where (because the air can be warmer than the MRT), you would get values that are above the saturation line. \u00a0If you have an explanation for this, Francesco, please share.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 04, 2016 at 07:03AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1610194", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1610633"}
