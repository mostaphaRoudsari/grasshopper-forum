{"body": "\nHello guys,\n\n\n\nI am trying to conduct an indoor evaluation. I believe I have set everything correct but the component keeps giving the error \"The calculation has been terminated by the user!\" which I think means some of my settings/inputs are wrong.\n\n\n\nI have Chris's file on the other tab and it works ok, with the same exact settings. What am I doing wrong?\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 08, 2015 at 11:22PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Adaptive Indoor Comfort Evaluation", "id": "topic_1220943"}
