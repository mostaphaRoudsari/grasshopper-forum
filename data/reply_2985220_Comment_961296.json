{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThere should be a reason that I always release the view analysis with a bug! I forgot an underline.\n\ncustomHeading = '\\n\\nView Analysis' + '\\n#View Points = ' + `len(****_****viewPoints)`\n\n\n\nNow it is fixed and running. I will update the source code and the download link shortly:\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/1Q*fTOyGxICOXIl0WjUcj-5zmVGreDIUzLiBtFFD6*CbylFdTzT-0cLxsH5AvSuHvuahV9O*RaWj*YSYnen98tDox8-yXdi2/viewAnalysis_02.png?width=650\" width=\"650\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/1Q*fTOyGxICOXIl0WjUcj-5zmVGreDIUzLiBtFFD6*CbylFdTzT-0cLxsH5AvSuHvuahV9O*RaWj*YSYnen98tDox8-yXdi2/viewAnalysis_02.png)\n\n\n\nWhenever you get an error that says \"lb_preparation has no method called joinMesh\" it means there is an older version of ladybug flying on your system. You just need to let the new Ladybug fly to overwrite the old version! :)\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A961298", "name": "viewAnalysis_02.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 21, 2013 at 6:02am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_961381", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_961296"}
