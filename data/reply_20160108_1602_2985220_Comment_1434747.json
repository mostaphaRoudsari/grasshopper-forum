{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nThe error was a bug that I have just fixed:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/de15d1dd2b5411ec...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/de15d1dd2b5411ecdf6f03bad86ecec3c39cea64)\n\nThank you, as always, for finding these issues before anyone else does.\n\nThe results with the view component should be equivalent to the LB_shadingMask as I am using the exact same method of projecting vectors to the center of the sky patches. \u00a0The only thing that I can think might be causing the 1-2% discrepancy is that Mostapha might be accounting for the areas of the sky patches and I am just assuming that each sky patch is of equal area to the others. \u00a0If anyone has any strong feeling about accounting for the areas of the sky patches, let me know and I can work it in. \u00a0I know that Tregenza originally divided them that way to have as equal areas as possible so I thought that I might be safe with the assumption.\n\nThe skyDensity and viewResolution inputs are the same parameter from the perspective of the LB_LB component that generates the patches/vectors. \u00a0I used the more general term \"viewResolution\" since I am using the evenly distributed vectors for other types of view analysis (like spherical view) and not just sky view.\n\nHow far off is the agreement with the VSC component? \u00a0Radiance is going to use the stoichastic method, which is going to be different than projecting the same evenly distributed view vectors. \u00a0If it's really far from a high resolution view study, maybe we need to look into the HB_VSC code.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 08, 2016 at 04:02PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1431384", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1434747"}
