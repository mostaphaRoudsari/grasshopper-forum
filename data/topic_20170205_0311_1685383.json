{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI'm glad to share some useful tools with those people who use ENVI-Met v.4.0 for their researches. (a software that is very slow but accurate enough, XD).<br/> I have written two LB components which let you visualize and manipulate data that come from ENVI-Met simulations. These component are based on a research with ENVI-Met v.3.0 and Ladybug that I did in 2015:\u00a0\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281031049_Outdoor_Comfort_...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281031049_Outdoor_Comfort_the_ENVI-BUG_tool_to_evaluate_PMV_values_point_by_point)\n\n\n\nIt is possible to combine LB_ENVI-Met Grid with other LB component, such as: Ladybug_Mesh Threshold Selector, Ladybug_Countour Mesh, Ladybug_Recolor Mesh,\u00a0Ladybug_Outdoor Comfort Calculator, Ladybug_Thermal Comfort Indices.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/*ix1zXEQDKMwvAa6jfbGSyXHlM8GkRvQJ-s7cihCIZsnqeifTsAjqAg5zq8rQQLNDVgpLjfXUasmHizWZ1IjZvJP*qEizJRc/LB_ENVIMet_0.png?width=650\" width=\"650\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/*ix1zXEQDKMwvAa6jfbGSyXHlM8GkRvQJ-s7cihCIZsnqeifTsAjqAg5zq8rQQLNDVgpLjfXUasmHizWZ1IjZvJP*qEizJRc/LB_ENVIMet_0.png)\n\n- Antonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "February 05, 2017 at 03:11AM", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "topic": "LB_ENVI-Met", "id": "topic_1685383"}
