{"body": "\nHi Saurabh,\n\nChris has implemented lighting schedules for OpenStudio. [I opened an issue](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/455)\u00a0so he can take a look at this and another similar issue. If he couldn't take a look soon I will give it a try.\n\nI assume you're using OpenStudio HVAC systems and that's why you're not using EnergyPlus component. Is that right?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 12, 2016 at 8:25pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1437718", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1437586"}
