{"body": "\nI'm working to advise my colleagues on when it's appropriate to use a full year analysis period and when one might want to use a particular subset of a year, both for more accurate results and to reduce computational burden.\n\n\n\nThe generic goal is to analyze radiation to inform a shading solution to provide thermal comfort for the building's inhabitants.\n\n\n\nIn the past I've charted dry bulb temperature and isolated those hours throughout the year where the temperature is above approx. 70-75deg F / 21-23deg C.\n\n\n\nI get the same exact result (mid-March through mid-October for NYC) if I use the Ladybug Psychometric chart used with only basic inputs (dry bulb, humidity, pressure) and isolate the HOY which fall into the comfort/passive polygon. I think this is due to the consistently high humidity and pressure in the NYC area, meaning their effect on the analysis period is negligible.\n\n\n\nAt any rate I just wanted to make sure that my thinking is correct on this and that I'm isolating this period in the most efficient manner possible, as I would like to present this workflow to my colleagues. I've attached my file below and would appreciate anyone taking the time to review it.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/gkyeY5S7fAzEcFK5boZ8Axr9hdMw3cj54XKncMANVYDyT8yN5gB7ny26XKHk*N2orMy3UZbA2iAt--mxJYm36dCmDk3tVY7J/ladybug.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/gkyeY5S7fAzEcFK5boZ8Axr9hdMw3cj54XKncMANVYDyT8yN5gB7ny26XKHk*N2orMy3UZbA2iAt--mxJYm36dCmDk3tVY7J/ladybug.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1160987", "name": "ComfortAnalysisPeriod 002.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Brian Ringley", "created_at": "November 03, 2014 at 04:47PM", "created_by": "bringley", "topic": "Efficiently Constraining Analysis Periods When Simulating for Thermal Comfort", "id": "topic_1160988"}
