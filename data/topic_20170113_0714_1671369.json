{"body": "\nHello Ladybug\n\n\n\nI would like to evaluate behavior of roof surface in the matter of heat reflection. The goal is pro provide relevant data that show the difference between classic PVC rooftop (production hall) and vegetation roof - how much heat is being absorbed and reflected back to the air. It has a significant impact on how the building surrounding behave. Is there also a chance to simulate wind influence? Imagine that there's a building surface that heats up the air and wind spreads that heated air around, which is bad for the soil, plants and even people living in the neighbourhood.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis research is at its beginning, so I am still gathering some relevant informations about this topic.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks!\u00a0\n\n\n\nPetr\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Petr Vacek", "created_at": "January 13, 2017 at 07:14AM", "created_by": "PetrVacek", "topic": "Roof heat reflection", "id": "topic_1671369"}
