{"body": "\nHi Julian,\n\n\n\nHere are a few things that you can do:\n\n1. Make the calculation completely deterministic and get rid of ambient parameters: Looking at your model, I don't see the geometry being surrounded by anything else (like walls, ceiling etc.). So, specifying ambient parameters in the simulation does not serve any purpose.\n\n2. Get rid of source subdivision by setting -ds to 0. This will make Radiance assume that your source is a point source ( which seems to be a valid assumption in your case).\n\n3. Finally, you can cut down the time even more by magnifying the candela value of a single light fixture instead of using the 9 fixtures that you have right now. This is a hack, but will work because that way, even the deterministic part of the calculation will feature only 1 variable instead of 9. You can make this work by increasing the candelaMultiplier of that one source by 9.\n\nI have attached a gh file (which shows the parameters options) as an example. The points I have made above will mostly work for electric lighting only. Daylighting needs different kind of optimization because we are dealing with parallel rays from the sun and not a source with directional distribution like electric lights.\n\n\n\nThe image below is base-case. Takes the maximum time, using default settings.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Nzsxa*Wuim8*fQmEqavtm3tBIlhhJb2ZVFkFioBqK29Os8OOalcei7XAFb2IW5XpM2*8VCptamPjOWJKD6jguskm7Hfu1NNd/baseCase.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Nzsxa*Wuim8*fQmEqavtm3tBIlhhJb2ZVFkFioBqK29Os8OOalcei7XAFb2IW5XpM2*8VCptamPjOWJKD6jguskm7Hfu1NNd/baseCase.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one is with direct-only calculations.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Nzsxa*Wuim*luYKmGw09N6yShi3dRNgVfSEzj11Ac5ue3eTPkmIZOcPpepkr6TWnq8QbzldcNpBGaumx2v6adLnblfs*g8Jh/directOnly.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Nzsxa*Wuim*luYKmGw09N6yShi3dRNgVfSEzj11Ac5ue3eTPkmIZOcPpepkr6TWnq8QbzldcNpBGaumx2v6adLnblfs*g8Jh/directOnly.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the case where a single fixture was used and the candela multiplier was used to magnify it's brightness 9 times. Took the least amount of time....but as you can there is a perceptible difference between this one and the base-case.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Nzsxa*Wuim8eJUwxWAR9GsRVgtkhUOgnCobOd1yJs0TAQ4-JKWevwm9g-XP8SoggdOBxV22tbFN-DCc0mXu5RXIufu7ywuOC/directOnlySingle.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Nzsxa*Wuim8eJUwxWAR9GsRVgtkhUOgnCobOd1yJs0TAQ4-JKWevwm9g-XP8SoggdOBxV22tbFN-DCc0mXu5RXIufu7ywuOC/directOnlySingle.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1726048", "name": "test_lux_surface_definition_Sarith.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "April 2, 2017 at 5:04pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1725208", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726046"}
