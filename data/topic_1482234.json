{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI have worked with DIVA for Rhino and already tried DIVA for GH, but I just started. Now I want to use Honeybee for more controlled simulations. In DIVA for GH there is no problem using the material from C:\\DIVA\\Daylight\\material.\n\nIn Honeybee I wasn't able to import this RAD file. I had to add every material with the addtolibrary component.\n\n\n\nYesterday, HB told me about the new version, so I've done the update. Looks like there are some very helpful new tools... but I can't get HB to fly (Ladybug flies).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DJM5x*C0fQLKAkao3VhjVQeGo8gQe7tXZVD7QUrLAfet*SBgcDLQuCx4Fdtdel3EoM*NwyqCs5JYKkFnSBaykd8gqhiXtVWi/CantStartKopie.PNG?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DJM5x*C0fQLKAkao3VhjVQeGo8gQe7tXZVD7QUrLAfet*SBgcDLQuCx4Fdtdel3EoM*NwyqCs5JYKkFnSBaykd8gqhiXtVWi/CantStartKopie.PNG)\n\n\n\nThe addto/callfromlibrary component says:\n\n1. Solution exception:honeybee_RADMaterialAUX\n\n\n\nNever had this Problem before and I don't know how to solve it.\n\nPlease, can you help?\n\n\n\nJakob\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jakob Schmidt", "created_at": "March 11, 2016 at 7:36am", "created_by": "JakobSchmidt", "topic": "RAD material problem", "id": "topic_1482234"}
