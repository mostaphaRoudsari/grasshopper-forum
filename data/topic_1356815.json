{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI am not sure if this is a question or a request, might be both.\n\n\n\nOkay let's imagine we want to model a high-rise building with something like 50+ floors.\n\n\n\nWe always start simple, so we model a typical floor. We pass the Rhino model to HB, create our zones, add our glazing, shading surfaces, and we run our first simulations.\n\n\n\nNext step, we want to model a few different floors, that might represent the building's performance better (e.g. lower floor, middle floor, penthouse). How can we go from the typical floor (which probably took a couple of days to model surface by surface) to multiple floors without re-doing the whole process? It would be great if there was a way to simply copy paste everything and new zones would be created, since they are the same. I understand that this might be a grasshopper limitation, as breps are location specific in Rhino (I think?).\n\n\n\nStill a way to quickly set up any number of clones of our typical floor withn HB would save countless hours. Also, if this is already there in some kind of way I apologize, and cool!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "September 8, 2015 at 1:42am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Modeling high rise buildings in HB", "id": "topic_1356815"}
