{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nFirst, I'm running Radiance version 4.2.1.\n\nI tried running simulations using only one core to see if it's the multi-core part that's problematic and that's not the case.\n\nWhat I've noticed is that by changing the view angle just a bit in Rhino will either make the image-based simulation work or fail. Even in \"Top\" view, depending on how I've zoomed in the scene, it makes a difference.\n\nThe falsecolor HDR seems to consistently work. The normal render HDR doesn't always. Converting HDR to GIF is also inconsistent, and I'm not sure why since the code doesn't change...\n\n\n\nHere are some screenshots of a case that was successful and another that failed. I've also included the files. Notice the slight change in viewing angle.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1137423", "name": "testing.zip"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1137424", "name": "Failed.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1137425", "name": "Successful.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Vasken Merovingian", "created_at": "September 25, 2014 at 7:12am", "created_by": "VaskenMerovingian", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1136995", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1137421"}
