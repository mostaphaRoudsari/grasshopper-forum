{"body": "\nHi all,\u00a0\n\nI have created some custom constructions for roofs and walls and saved them in the Energy plus library using the component \"Add to EnegyPlus Library component\". However, every single time I open the grasshopper file I need to create the customized constructions again, as the program doesnt seem to remember them. Is there any way to keep them in the library permanently?\u00a0\n\nAlejandro\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "November 17, 2014 at 9:00am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Create custom constructions in HB", "id": "topic_1170286"}
