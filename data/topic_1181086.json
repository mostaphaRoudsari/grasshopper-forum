{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nSome knowledge questions:\n\n\n\nI use the DSParameters component to control the ANN Analysis Recepe but the ResultUnit still remain as VAR. They don t change based on the DSParameter _outputUnits input. (attached)\n\n\n\nIs there a way to get the annual analysis results represented on the mesh as raw values an not in relation to any autonomy or thresholds?\n\n\n\nSecond question is related to first as if the analysis is for radiance then there is no point to check the autonomy based on lux ( I assume...)\n\n\n\nIn the ReadAnnualResults I what is the DLA threshold? 300?\n\n\n\nMany thanks!\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1181085", "name": "Sustainability_Annual_Analysis_GRD.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "December 4, 2014 at 12:19pm", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Honeybee Annual Daylight Analysis Resutls manipulation", "id": "topic_1181086"}
