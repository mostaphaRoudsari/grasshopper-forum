{"body": "\nDear Mostapha,\n\nthank you for your kind reply.\u00a0\n\nI will be more than happy to provide a model for your demonstration. However, the whole structure is much bigger (around 200x80m) with multiple openings, maybe I could reduce it to half for this purpose. Also, the bottom plane (subject of analysis) is a curved surface, so this could be useful as well. Regarding the material properties, I think a couple of simple material could be used. It would be highly appreciated if you could demonstrate the influence of ' amount of reflection' of base surface on overall result (for example, the amount of reflection of walls).\n\nPM me for the model details.\n\nRegards,\n\nPetar\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Petar Pejic", "created_at": "March 12, 2014 at 11:03AM", "created_by": "PetarPejic", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1024750", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1024661"}
