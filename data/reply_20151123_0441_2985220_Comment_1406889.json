{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks for the reply and sorry for delay, time zone and work here. Anyway, I'm having a cognitive dissonance here, just to check if I understand the Reinhart patching correctly, let's say we have 8760 hours a year (which is a close approximation of a value they have in .epw file) and a dome made of 580 patches, so I thought that each patch will have 8760/580 hours, which is about 15 hours, which doesn't make sense after you say that \"Reinhart sky being finer than the hourly resolution of sun positions\". I don't get it man.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "November 23, 2015 at 04:41AM", "created_by": "Timur582", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1407829", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1406889"}
