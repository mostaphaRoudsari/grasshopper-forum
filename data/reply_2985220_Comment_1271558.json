{"body": "\nHi Roland,<br/><br/>Most Typical meteorological year data sets (1,2,3) have data range of 30 years, with TMY3 also having 14 range for some locations. IWEC has minimum range of 12 years. But not all years were taken into account from this range. <br/>So the larger the range, the better the weather sample, but I would say if you can't find better than that, 10 year range will do the job.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "April 23, 2015 at 3:07pm", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "topic_1271532", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1271558"}
