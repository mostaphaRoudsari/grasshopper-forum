{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\nThanks for the reply. I will download the old version for now and see how i get on.\n\n\n\nHaving done little reading on the subject so far - could you tell me if Butterfly can handle open channel fluid flow? I am looking to model an ell bypass for a dam which has a combination of open channel and pipe flow.\n\n\n\nDo you think Butterfly would be suitable?\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nLyndon\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lyndon Johnson", "created_at": "October 31, 2016 at 08:15PM", "created_by": "LyndonJohnson", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1629765", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1629602"}
