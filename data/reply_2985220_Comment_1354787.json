{"body": "\nHi Mathias,\n\nHow do you load annual data into Grasshopper? 5 minutes sounds like so much for 500 points. Are you using \"Honeybee_Read All the Hourly Results from Annual Daylight Study\"?\n\nIn any case once you have it in Grasshopper you can run all the post processing pretty fast. I mean you don't need to import them every single time. Is that make sense?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 4, 2015 at 1:32pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1354812", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1354787"}
