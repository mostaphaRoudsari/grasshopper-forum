{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nMy Apologies. I still haven't got time to do the test case. A bit tight on schedule for few more days. The paper would be a great aid to justify use of using LB/HB to calculate Thermal Comfort. For final design submissions people are still relying on IES. I hope it will change soon.\n\nLater on I hope I can run a test case both in IES and GH for comparison. Will update on that soon.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs always, thank you all for the wonderful work.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nSaket\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saket Sarupria", "created_at": "March 29, 2017 at 09:48PM", "created_by": "SaketSarupria", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1723760", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1723858"}
