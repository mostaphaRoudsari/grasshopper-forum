{"body": "\nAmir,\n\nI may be out of focus here, but since this last couple of days i was also dealing with installing issues (successful at the end) i can bring to your attention a couple of points:\n\nIf you have a previous installed version, you need to fully uninstall. Including all the items and not only OF. Pay attention also to delete the .docker and .VirtualBox directories at your local C:\\Users\\USERNAME (see the point before the name).\n\nYou need to enable Hardware assisted virtualization at your machine BIOS (personally i don't like to play with the BIOS but OF asked for it).\n\nAfter that, do install a clean OF version, and go according to the other recommendations in this [link](http://www.openfoam.com/download/txt/openfoam-windows-readme_v1612+.txt).\n\n\n\nIt is working for me now on 2 machines (laptop and desktop).\n\nAfter that remember to run rhino as administrator.\n\nGood luck,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 22, 2017 at 9:25am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1696482", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1697664"}
