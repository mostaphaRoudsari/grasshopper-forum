{"body": "\nBlanca,\n\nIndeed something wrong. I don't know why you decided to use Construction:WindowEquivalentLayer for your window. I usually don't use this and right now can't check the \"benefits\" of it. I use a plain/normal Construction definition, assigning the material defined for the simple glazing. See attached. I left your definition as is and added mine at the end.\n\nYou forgot to internalize the geometry. I checked it with a simple rectangle as input for the initial curve.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 24, 2015 at 11:21AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1348248", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1348344"}
