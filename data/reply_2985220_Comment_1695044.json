{"body": "\nThere are a couple of mixed questions here so I try to separate them and answer some of them.\n\n\n\n1. Can one create an epw file if you have weather data in other formats?\n\nThe short answer is yes. It doesn't mean that your weather data will be changed to TMY but you can always format the data in EnergyPlus Weather (epw) file structure.\n\n\n\n2. If one has the data how they can create an epw file from the raw data.\n\nEpw file is a csv file. Check\u00a0[this link](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/auxiliary-programs/energyplus-weather-file-epw-data-dictionary.html) to understand how it is structured. You can create one from scratch or modify an available weather file. There are also a couple of programs such as WeatherConverter which comes with EnergyPlus installation (C:\\EnergyPlusV8-6-0\\PreProcess\\WeatherConverter) that can help you to automate the process.\n\n\n\n3. Does one need to have access to epw file to run butterfly?\n\nNo.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 19, 2017 at 10:03am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1694663", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1695044"}
