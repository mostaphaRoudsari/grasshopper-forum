{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for the update! It is a very useful output indeed!\n\n\n\nI will come back to you for the other questions, doing some research on CFD right now due to some simulations I am running. Will let you know when I have more. I did mean roughness length indeed. It is one of the inputs required. I will go over the literature soon and provide you with the equations used in some examples.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 12, 2015 at 12:48AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240965", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240892"}
