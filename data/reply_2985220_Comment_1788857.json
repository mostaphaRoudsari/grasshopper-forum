{"body": "\nEhsan,\n\nI've lost track of the main question of this discussion but the short answer is that you can model pretty much any incompressible flow simulation that you want with butterfly right now. \u00a0Typically, it's easier to just study the outside or inside one at a time but, if what you are studying is the transition between indoors/outdoors, there's no reason why you couldn't model it.\n\nOpenFOAM (the CFD engine under the hood of Butterfly) has been validated extensively and is one of the few CFD engines that has been validated to essentially the same degree that ANSYS has.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 25, 2017 at 10:34pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1786769", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1788857"}
