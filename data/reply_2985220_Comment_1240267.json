{"body": "\nHi Tasos,\n\nI'm not going to be very helpful here but ... you just have a lot of work to do to make it work right. Right now the file is pretty messy.\n\nYou need to work at HB_Surface label, rather than full zones in order to assign the constructions you want to the proper geometry. Hope this is clear to you.\n\nThe daylighting is not showing you what you want to see becouse it is not supposed to do so. The EP materials you assign are for (of course) E+ and not for Radiance. So if you don't see \"the light\" it doeasn't mean in this case, that the definitions are right or wrong for E+ (in this case they are wrong).\n\nSorry for this but there is so much work to do here that i don't have the time to be more helpful.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 11, 2015 at 1:30am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1240238", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240267"}
