{"body": "\nHi Sarith,\n\n\n\nWas mostly interested in the control algorithms and the evaluation of photosensors and their impact to energy consumption. As I said I'm only just starting to scatch under that surface I knew about these tools. I do remember however that photosensors and their distribution in space was hard to do (or a bit limited in any case) in E+. Daysim might be an answer (even though I do wish I could use my BSDF files) to this.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI guess if Daysim already does all this in HB then I probably should just go through a tool first before I ask :)\n\n\n\nBtw, thanks a bunch for the electric lighting components. It's amazing having them in an interface like GH and the possibilities for parametric design that gives. I'm working on a definition about this, I'll post it soon for feedback.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 21, 2016 at 8:42am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1511847", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1513164"}
