{"body": "\nDear Theodore.<br/> <br/> I really appreciate your suggestion, however i cannot quite implement the way you have mentioned.\u00a0\n\nMy main goal now is to find a best PV panel in terms of electricity generation (maximizing output) that the panel itself take account of surrounding shadings. When I do it parametrically, the shading obstacles are also changes simultaneously as the PV panel change its shape.<br/> <br/> Could you please elaborate little bit how you deal with this kind of issue? I cannot replicate as you explained above.\u00a0<br/> <br/> The overall issue is that\u00a0**PhotovoltaicsSurface**\u00a0component needs a data on\u00a0input\u00a0**DCtoACderateFactor_***\u00a0*node, which requires a data from\u00a0**DCtoACderateFactor**\u00a0component. To get this data, we need a\u00a0**SunpathShading**\u00a0component which needs another information from\u00a0**PhotovoltaicsSurface**\u00a0component. These three components are somehow connected to each other in order to yield potential electricity generation with the consideration of surrounding shading if I am not mistaken.<br/> In this case it the number of\u00a0**DCtoACderateFactor**\u00a0does not matter unless the recursion is solved is some other way.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKind regards.<br/> Amaraa\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "May 28, 2016 at 12:32am", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537338", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537607"}
