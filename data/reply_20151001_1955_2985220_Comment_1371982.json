{"body": "\nThanks Michael,\n\nAs Chris and Sarith mentioned Honeybee searches for radiance installation folder on the system but it only will find the folder if the path is already system paths:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeyb...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeybee_Honeybee.py#L279-L317)\n\n\n\nThe reason to avoid installation with DIVA is mainly their customized folder structure for Daysim and Radiance which can cause issue.\n\n\n\nThere is one extra check to make sure the path doesn't have white space ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeyb...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeybee_Honeybee.py#L7253)). This is my fault that Honeybee currently can't handle path with white spaces. It will be fixed in the near future ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/13](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/13)).\n\n\n\nIn any case the first two portion is a bug and should not be hard-coded. I just fixed them and uploaded the new version to github. Thanks!\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 01, 2015 at 07:55PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1369640", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1371982"}
