{"body": "\nHello,<br/> <br/> This is a continuation of the [discussion from the Butterfly github topic](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly/issues/12#issuecomment-219964332).<br/>\n\nByron, I would say that the confusion came from the assumption that \"Thermal Comfort Indices\" component will act the same as \"Outdoor Comfort Calculator\" component when it comes to data matching. So you supplied a list of certain values for each \"Thermal Comfort Indices\" component and expected from it to calculate the same number of PET values.<br/> \"Outdoor Comfort Calcualtor\" component acts in this way because it is using certain predefined equations where you just supply the four input values (Ta, Mrt, ws, rh) and it will do the data matching. \"Thermal Comfort Indices\" component does not act in this way, as it needs to calculate the sun angles first. <br/> <br/> This is why the \"Thermal Comfort Indices\" component's inputs are restricted to either a single value or 8767/8760 (with/without heading) values.<br/> So what you had to do is to graft all the inputs instead of flattening them. In this way each input value will be considered as a single value input. Check the attached **PET_on_Grid2.gh** file.\n\n<br/> Another and more clear solution is to graft only the solar radiation input, while keeping all the other inputs at 8767 values and use the HOY_ input. This is the **PET_on_Grid3.gh** file attached.<br/> <br/> Last night I\u00a0[modified the mean radiant temperature formula](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/pull/260) a bit (adding cloudiness factor), so you might also want to\u00a0[download the newest Thermal Comfort Indices component](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/userObjects/Ladybug_Thermal%20Comfort%20Indices.ghuser) (click on Raw, and move the downloaded .ghuser file to your File -&gt; Special Folders -&gt; User Object Folder)<br/> <br/> Hope this helps.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1534358", "name": "PET_on_Grid2.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1534359", "name": "PET_on_Grid3.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "May 21, 2016 at 6:01am", "created_by": "djordje", "topic": "PET example in Ladybug", "id": "topic_1534360"}
