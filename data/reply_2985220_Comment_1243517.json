{"body": "\nBurin,\n\nThanks for finding this bug. \u00a0I think you are setting the record for the most number of bugs found in the shortest amount of time.\n\nIt seems that I originally over-complicated the calculation of effective area by looking at my old textbooks. \u00a0In this case of the natural ventilation here that is mostly meant for single-zones, I realized that the effective area and opening are are one in the same.\n\nI have since fixed the bug and you can find the new component in the attached file and on the github.\n\nI should warn that, when you use wind ventilation as you do in the attached GH file, there is an assumption that there is unobstructed cross ventilation from one side of the zone to the other. \u00a0Normally, for closed test boxes with windows on only one side like that in the attached file, I would set the windDischargeCoefficient to 0 and only look at natural ventilation happening through buoyancy driven flow.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1243519", "name": "NatVent_bug_FIXED.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 16, 2015 at 12:49pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1243244", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1243517"}
