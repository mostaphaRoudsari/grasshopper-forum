{"body": "\nHi all,\n\ncan anyone help me with this, maybe i don't know grasshopper so well, i searched the forum but could not find an answer yet:\n\nI try to paste 8760 values in a multi-line panel, but the panel can't fit all of them, only a part of them is pasted. Moreover, i enter the panel to \"manually\" write the rest of the values, but it doesn't allow for any extra lines, it looks like it is full. I tried different values, and it seems it can paste all 8760 values if they are one-digit numbers. Anyone know why? P.S. they are pasted from the attached excel.\u00a0\n\n\n\nthank you in advance!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1463920", "name": "equipment Living Room.csv"}], "created_by_name": "Iason Bournas", "created_at": "February 15, 2016 at 4:46pm", "created_by": "IasonBournas", "topic": "can't paste all 8760 values in multi-line panel", "id": "topic_1463921"}
