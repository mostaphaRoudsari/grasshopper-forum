{"body": "\nHi, Mostapha.\n\nThanks a lot. After split all these surfaces the simulation works fine. And for the second question, when I turned on the 'Ideal air load system' at create HB zone component, the result became reasonable, so I think I might have missed some settings when I turned it off and set my own HVAC system. Do you or anyone else would be so kind to share an example file or advises about how to set up one's own HVAC system (or is that feasible)? Or should I just use the ideal air system and use the set HBzone load and schedule components to customize it?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n-Qinheng\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Qinheng", "created_at": "March 19, 2016 at 04:18PM", "created_by": "Qinheng", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489153", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1488553"}
