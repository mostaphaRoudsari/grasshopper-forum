{"body": "\nHi Dimitrios,\n\n\n\nThanks. In theory it shouldn't happen since all components are reading the values from a shared library and shared library is generated from the .json file which should be the same. Can you send me an example when this issue is happening?\n\n\n\nThe file is here:\u00a0[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/resources/...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/resources/OpenStudio_Standards.json)\n\nClick on RAW to download the file and let me know if there is any issues.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 05, 2015 at 12:02PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1218112", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1217888"}
