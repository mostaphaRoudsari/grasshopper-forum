{"body": "\nHi,\n\nbased on Mostapha's Honeybee-Tutorial I built up a slider animation, combined with the RUNALL-component. And it works perfectly.\n\nBut even the list item's wrap-boolean is set to \"false\" once the slider animation runs it never stops, it continues in eternal loops.\n\nHow is it possible, that after all sets have been processed, the animation/simulation stops?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance to all,\n\n\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1302626", "name": "SLIDER ANIMATION RUN RAD.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "June 4, 2015 at 9:19am", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "topic": "RUN ALL - SLIDER ANIMATION - HOW TO BREAK THE LOOP", "id": "topic_1302627"}
