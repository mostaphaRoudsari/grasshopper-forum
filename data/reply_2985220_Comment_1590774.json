{"body": "\nThank you Chris, and thank you for the merge.<br/><br/>On providing the usgs.gov SRTM v2 and v2.1 raw data, just a small addition if I may:<br/><br/>Terrain Generator 2 is using\u00a0[SRTM v3](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/measures/docs/NASA_SRTM_V3.pdf) raster data.<br/>A bit more flat and mountainous terrains in v2 and v2.1 had voids in its data set. SRTM v3 finally fixes these voids.<br/>Nevertheless the usgs.gov is quite useful, and provides the data along with documentation.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "August 30, 2016 at 2:01am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1589161", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1590774"}
