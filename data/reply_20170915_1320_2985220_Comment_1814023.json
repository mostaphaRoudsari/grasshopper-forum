{"body": "\nIn this method, can I still simulate the whole building performance to explore the amount of energy demand reduction due to the shading devices preventing the Sun's harsh rays penetrating into interior spaces?\n\n\n\nYou can but there is no built-in methods. You have to calculate the radiation reduction for each hour and apply it to the surface as the boundary using a schedule. Look for topics about complex fenestration modeling with Radiance and EnergyPlus.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 15, 2017 at 01:20PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1811085", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1814023"}
