{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI would like to re-create with honeybee a double-skin model with specific characteristics.\n\nI have tried to follow some other discussion about this subject but I still have several issues to solve before I can run my code:\n\n\n\n- How can I add a window in a correct way? I would like to create a window with specific dimensions (not only glazing ratio) and assign specific properties (light trasmittance, solar gain, thermal trasmittance). Is it possible only if I model everything as surfaces?\n\n- I have tried to use a previously developed tool, but it still does not recognize the internal window...why?\n\n- How can I take into account of shadings? I would like to assign specific material properties\n\n- How can I assign boundary conditions (i.e. internal walls adiabatic)?\n\n- How can I model natural ventilation in the cavity between the two skins (a thermal zone)?\n\n\n\nMy goal is to calculate surface wall/window temperature of the analyzed zone and then check PMV/PPD parameters.\n\n\n\nLast question - how can I download all the gitHub improvements? Because of firewall setting I cannot update automatically.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\n\nRiccardo\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1361097", "name": "DSF_test_v1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Riccardo Diaferia", "created_at": "September 14, 2015 at 8:55am", "created_by": "RiccardoDiaferia49", "topic": "Double skin facade with shadings", "id": "topic_1361098"}
