{"body": "\n- How to\u00a0**weight all objectives properly**? So I could get a .csv and present the results will pollination or in other graphs.\n\nIf you are using Octopus and setting up a multi-objective analysis, you don't need to weight the parameters. That's the benefit of using multi-objective optimization algorithms vs single objective. Google Pareto\u00a0front to read more.\n\n\n\n- How to do that in GH and Octopus?\n\nThis is a question for Octopus group. I shared with you a video that shows how you can set it up but generally speaking you can set it up for any objectives, environmental performance included. All the algorithm does is to receive a list of numbers and try to minimize them.\n\n\n\n- How would the iteration process go?Would there be a feedback process, where I have to go back and re run energy simulations ?(see image)Because of many objective I find it hard to design this workflow chart, and the definition.\n\nOnce you set up the model and let the optimization run it will generate the next generation based on evaluating the last/current generation so you don't need to get involved unless you want to.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 21, 2015 at 4:40pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1272210", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1269182"}
