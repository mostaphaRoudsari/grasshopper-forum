{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm dealing with some issues with plotting results in the AdaptiveChart component.\n\nAt first i noticed a strange pattern where the plotted results show that the 24 daily temperatures are aligned between them (see next image):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pn1gkRGKtSaQeot64cQGcPAAwJBmKS8ZYpoOS4oxHZ1xyJO9zVGGViX0W0dqH8KuhGWA8YaRg5WcsZfBQ2QKZAJA*JhQ*HH7/Capture1.JPG\" width=\"696\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pn1gkRGKtSaQeot64cQGcPAAwJBmKS8ZYpoOS4oxHZ1xyJO9zVGGViX0W0dqH8KuhGWA8YaRg5WcsZfBQ2QKZAJA*JhQ*HH7/Capture1.JPG)Then i compared the plotted results at CBE website with those of this component (see image). Clearly they don't agree with each other.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pn1gkRGKtSZHH2gUbrO2ZX2ORzB60icKJqIOD7vT7atV*LdlQTaz-YDeGIeRBVn-jHfWX2RTo0ylAb1IB0z0owzzNgzNdrsm/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pn1gkRGKtSZHH2gUbrO2ZX2ORzB60icKJqIOD7vT7atV*LdlQTaz-YDeGIeRBVn-jHfWX2RTo0ylAb1IB0z0owzzNgzNdrsm/Capture.JPG)So, is there something i'm missing or there is a real issue here?\n\n\n\nFor the same component i have another question: it is not clear for me the output degreesFromTarget. Can you explain what is the target (the band or a specific value)?\n\n\n\nBTW, i used for this discussion the hydra example AdaaptiveComfortChart.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "September 3, 2016 at 12:44pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "LB_AdaptiveChart plotting issues", "id": "topic_1593044"}
