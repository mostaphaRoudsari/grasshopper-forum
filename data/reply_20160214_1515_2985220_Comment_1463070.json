{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nNow that the purpose of all metrics has been clarified to me, I see good solid reasons for keeping and using the VSC component. \u00a0See this discussion for how all of this has all finally made sense to me:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/discussion-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/discussion-sky-view-factor)\n\nMy only issue now is that we should probably be more technically correct and\u00a0change the name of the component to simply be \u201cSky Component\u201d instead of \u201cVertical Sky Component\u201d. \u00a0This is because\u00a0the Vertical Sky Component recipe for Honeybee might not always be evaluating VERTICAL sky. \u00a0The sky component might be vertical, horizontal, or in any direction that the input test surface is placed and ptsVectors are oriented.\n\nAlso, as for the uniform sky issue in my previous post, I realized that the slight change in falsecolor around the circle does not actually affect the results and is probably the result of tolerances close to the horizon. \u00a0I apologize for the false alarm.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 03:15PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448921", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463070"}
