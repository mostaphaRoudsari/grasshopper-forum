{"body": "\n\"Thermal History\" in the meaning of surface temperatures of constuction (e.g.), a result of solar gain, zone temp. etc. And warmup period in the definition of energyplus. The thing is that I'm curious in using face changing materials (changing glass facade every hour), starting the simulation on an hourly basis, but finding a way to use the thermal history of the material chosen before. And, for curiosity, switching off the warmup days. And I came to the conclusion if I set the warmupdays to \"0\" with simControls, it ignores the input and writes the min and max values itself into *.idf (see attachment). There is no possibility in influencing it, right?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "August 26, 2015 at 3:19am", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1337973", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1349410"}
