{"body": "\nHi all ,\u00a0\n\nI'm working on my master's Thesis about \" the concept of breathing building to cope with climate change \" . I'm using responsive kinetic facade which moving according to changing in weather and the \u00a0needs of users inside the building .\n\nthe main goal is to achieve thermal comfort &amp; internal air quality by natural ventilation through the interactive facade .\n\nso I need to know how to optimize the movement of the facade ?\u00a0\n\nwhat plug in can I use to get thermal simulation &amp; air movement through building zones?\u00a0\n\nis there certain steps should I know to achieve my goal ? as I'm new in grasshopper just know basics only :)\u00a0\n\nThank you\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "February 2, 2015 at 2:17pm", "created_by": "monarezk", "topic": "energy simulation of a breathing building", "id": "topic_1215809"}
