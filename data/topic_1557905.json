{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI\u00a0would like to know if there is a way to maintain the same legend when i run a Microclimate map analysis.\n\nTo be more clear I would like to know if when I try to have a look step by step (let\u00b4s say in the morning, afternoon and evening)\u00a0to the results of the\u00a0analysis period, there is a way to have always the same legend. Because I have seen that it changes depending on the plotted values and not on\u00a0the values of the\u00a0entire analysis. I have tried to use Legend Par but I\u00a0still have the same problem.\u00a0\n\nSomeone have some suggestions?\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 30, 2016 at 4:24am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Legend - Visualize Microclimate Map", "id": "topic_1557905"}
