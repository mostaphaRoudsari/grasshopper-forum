{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nthank you. Actually I did to write the right address and file name. Anyway now it worked, could be that before there were not in the same directory of the .epw file also the other files, the .ddy .stat and .txt that comes together when you download it?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/BykvwnNi9Lsz*t0tKk-s-Jv9KJabrn3EQLnOqiEV25J53F-yuZ8MCPYMXBxOlRz8Fhx9RzzT0Lje5e4svvDmUuPr91jYOlts/GCS_ok1.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/BykvwnNi9Lsz*t0tKk-s-Jv9KJabrn3EQLnOqiEV25J53F-yuZ8MCPYMXBxOlRz8Fhx9RzzT0Lje5e4svvDmUuPr91jYOlts/GCS_ok1.png)\n\n\n\nI have one general question: so to perform solar radiation analysis with LadyBug is necessary the weather file .epw, right? This is quite a limitation because for many minor locations it doesn't exist. If I understand correctly this will be not a problem anymore with Honeybee right? (because it uses EnergyPlus I understood,\u00a0like Diva). When you think you will release Honeybee? Thank you for the work you are doing.\n\n\n\nBest regards.\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "May 30, 2013 at 04:40AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_861614", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_863174"}
