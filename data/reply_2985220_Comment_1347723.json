{"body": "\nHi Antonio,\n\nI don't have access to DesignBuilder but tried to import it into OpenStudio and it works fine. There are some warnings about surfaces with less than 3 points which is a different issue.\n\n\n\nDid you try to contact DesignBuilder team about this issue? I'm curious to know their input.\n\n\n\nI second Chris's comment about virtual partitions.
