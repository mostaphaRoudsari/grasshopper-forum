{"body": "\nChris, hello. Here you mention that you can drive dimming of electrochromics with a pre-built schedule. That sounds nifty, so I tried it, but can't get the system to respond to a fractional schedule - only to a boolean 1/0 schedule. It may be that this is not actually possible, but if you've done it, I'd like to replicate it.\u00a0\n\nI was working with a version of the file in this thread, copy uploaded. Any ideas you have, I'm all ears.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\nNick.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1554820", "name": "NoCenPT_AY _NN.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Nick Novelli", "created_at": "June 23, 2016 at 05:53PM", "created_by": "NickNovelli", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1498336", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1554818"}
