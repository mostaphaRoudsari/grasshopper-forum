{"body": "\nHi Luciano, Thank you so much for your helpful response. I\"m currently using Envimet to evaluate different street configurations in urban settings. I've heard about RayMan model ([This research paper](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-006-0061-8)) but I didn't realize that it's an actual software. So, upon your response, I searched up the software, and I tried to download it, but there was a problem with their website. To be able to download it I have to fill a short form, I did so but the form won't submit, I think the submit button doesn't work. Any chance you have a copy of the software that you can share with me.\n\nI like your component, looks promising :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "April 24, 2015 at 2:35pm", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1271407", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1272376"}
