{"body": "\nHi Mitra,\n\n<br/>Abraham is spot on. Your context geometry needed to be very simple. I have made a simple polysurface to use as a context in your file. Everything works with that polysurface. One more thing. As I was testing the polysurface, I noted that the Ladybug_Shading Mask_II was not outputting anything from maskedSkyDome. I went ahead and fixed that in the component, so for now, it will work fo you. I will also share the same issue with masters to fix this in a permanent manner.\n\n\n\nDevang\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1638863", "name": "4.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1638864", "name": "maskshadow.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1638865", "name": "Shading Masks.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "November 14, 2016 at 02:48AM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "topic_1638931", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1638861"}
