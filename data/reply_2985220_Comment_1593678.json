{"body": "\nHi Ata,\n\n\n\nDo you want to run E+ simulation? If so, you can create shading using E+ shading creator component and set the control type. Although there is no radiation threshold as there is in E+.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf you want to run an Annual daylight simulation and want to simulate lighting sensors, you can create lighting control group using the component of same name and set a threshold. This component works on the basis of illuminance. So, there is a difference of metric. Once, the annual simulation is run, you can extract the lighting schedule and feed it in to your E+ simulation.\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n\nAll the best,\n\nRam\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ram Joshi", "created_at": "September 4, 2016 at 10:19pm", "created_by": "RamJoshi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1593535", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1593678"}
