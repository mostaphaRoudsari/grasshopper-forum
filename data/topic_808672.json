{"body": "\nThis is a reply to a questions from Jacob (and\u00a0Abraham):\n\n\"**...****which measuring unit does your radiation component output?**\"\n\n\n\nThere are two different outputs that has two different measuring units:\n\n\n\n**radiationResult**\u00a0is the amount of radiation for each test point in [kWh/m2]\n\n**Note**: each test point is the center of a mesh face and the number represents the amount of radiation per m2 of that mesh face.\n\n\n\n**totalRadiation**\u00a0is radiationResult for each point [kWh/m2] * area of the face [m2] so it is in [kWh]\n\nThe image below shows how you can regenerate the totalRadiation by\u00a0multiplying\u00a0radiationResult with the area of each face.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/LuE0p2I1yg*OGe8DRZ2AKEQF3PnM92urmSr3KC-JZ4O2KrwAZZ8XAUENNB4vIFjoMLcqZBPTaRJRt*E6M5YOq6O0x2tRvy-Z/totalRadiation.jpg?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com/files/LuE0p2I1yg*OGe8DRZ2AKEQF3PnM92urmSr3KC-JZ4O2KrwAZZ8XAUENNB4vIFjoMLcqZBPTaRJRt*E6M5YOq6O0x2tRvy-Z/totalRadiation.jpg)\n\nRegards, -Mostapha\n\n\n\n<font size=\"2\">PS: Also thanks to djordje for correcting my\u00a0</font>grammar<font size=\"2\">.
