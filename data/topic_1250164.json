{"body": "\nGreeting Ladybug Community!\n\nThis is just to let you know that there will be a 3-hour workshop/webinar on Honeybee Daylight on April 24th. The workshop will cover all of the basics of setting up daylight simulations at a pace where those with Honeybee pre-installed can follow along. This will be followed by a faster, near-complete overview of all daylight simulation types and the application of the results to design.\n\nThe organizers of the webinar have greatly decreased the cost for registration to just $10 so, if you have been looking to pick up some knowledge on the daylighting tools, this is a great opportunity to get you started and obtain an overview of what you can do. For seasoned daylight users, I think you will find some new features covered in the workshop that you might not have been aware of initially.\n\nThe workshop is a part of a larger series on energy tools that you can find here ([http://www.performance.network/](http://www.performance.network/)).<br/>You can register for the Honeybee Daylight event by going to this address:\n\n[https://attendee.gototraining.com/r/6086496514016899074](https://attendee.gototraining.com/r/6086496514016899074)\n\nHope to see see you there!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 25, 2015 at 1:09pm", "created_by": "chris", "topic": "Honeybee Daylight Workshop / Webinar", "id": "topic_1250164"}
