{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nThanks for the support and for the info about the Climate Consultant team's response. \u00a0I added in\u00a0\"Humidification Only\" and \"Dehumidification Only\" polygons to the Passive Strategy List (see attached).\n\nAlthough I am open to the idea of having polygons for adaptive comfort, passive solar, and indirect evaporative cooling, I think that I will still need a bit of convincing about how to implement these. \u00a0For example, how should I deal with how the adaptive model changes with increased wind speed? \u00a0Should I have two adaptive comfort polygons? \u00a0Also, I am guessing that passive solar has to account for the solar radiation in the EPW file in some way. \u00a0Finally, what is the equivalent of a line of constant wet bulb temerpature for indirect evaporative cooling and where does it come from?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 13, 2015 at 5:17pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1359674", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1360698"}
