{"body": "\nI've decided to simplify things by just allow the 3 windows to move around in their individual bounding surfaces. It does not cause that many limitations in my case.\u00a0<br/><br/>Both of your propositions are interesting. And i have a connected question that has to do with them both; how to minimize computation time while not messing up the solution landscape. I have 4 sliders right now. Two for placement position and two for window size. Some values for window size are unnecessary in certain window placements as it would cause overlapping of surface boundary. I have several ways of dealing with this, all affecting the fitness landscape:<br/><br/>1. make certain slider positions create redundant values, i.e windows cant grow. octopus will be simulating some of those positions all the same. There are sadly no sliders with dynamic bounds to my knowledge, and if i were to use one Im not sure how it would confuse octopus - having genes vary outside its control.\n\n\n\n2. penalize overlapping by skipping simulation and assigning it values that gives it a \"bad spot\" in the solution space, much like Theodoros proposes. Saves computation time but I am worried about discontinuity of fitness landscape.\n\n\n\n3. Setting the overlap as an objective to be minimized, like Mostapha proposes. I imagine this works but would require a fair amount of simulations with overlapping windows. I guess it would be similar to the alternative 1 in terms of computation time.<br/><br/>4. Manually creating a list of all possible window position and sizes. Reducing the gene sliders to only 1 instead of 4. hmmm... what impact would that have? I have a feeling its not good.<br/><br/>What do you think?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "February 02, 2016 at 07:46AM", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1451369", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1452863"}
