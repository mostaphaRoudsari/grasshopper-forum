{"body": "\nHi Blanca,\n\nSome good news and some ... so so news.\n\nThe good ones: It runs. I updated the file to the last version from the github. See attached.\n\nI would bet that the error in your file was the timestep in the HB_EPOutput. You wrote \"annually\" and it should be \"annual\". The previous component version didn't check that. But this is just a bet. Now is fixed.\n\nThe so so ones: some of your zones are open breps. Even though the HB_LabelZones attribute is saying that all are closed. See red arrows comparing this output with the one from anh HBZones output. This can be fine but as a default i would say that it isn't. I'll recommend to fix this. The other thing is that the HB_OSHVACSystems/_seeHVACDesc_ input fails the component when set to True. So i set it to False. Hope it is not important for your calculations.\n\n\n\nSo after all this, i thing i carched here 2 bugs: A faulty attribute report and a conditional input that fails the HVAC component. But those are for Mostapha and Chris.\n\n\n\nLast thing: I really enjoyed the way you defined the zones. I learned a couple of things. Thanks.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 4, 2015 at 1:03pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1337735", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1338070"}
