{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nSorry for being away, been kind of busy.\n\n\n\nMostapha, I will try and email the model the coming days. The tricky part is that I can't really share it online due to confidentiality issues.\n\n\n\nI did however run into a similar problem in another much simpler model.\n\n\n\nHow on earth should I model simple, low-rise appartments? The floor layout changes from level to level. I ended up breaking up the floor/ceilings every time I added a level to the model. Resulted in a pain in the ass modelling process and similar azimuth errors. However, this time I feel it's because of me.\n\n\n\nIs there a better way to simulate this? I know intersect masses does this (from Chris's video tutorials) but if I'm not mistaken in that case it was breps and not honeybee zones. There must be a better work flow however :(\n\n\n\nAlso, stupid question, what do we do with floor/ceilings. I mean since I am supposed (I hope I've been understanding Mostapha correctly in this whole post) to use the same surface as floor and ceiling between two levels, can I change orientations without internalizing? Or do I need to internalize?\n\n\n\nSorry for the mess of questions. I'm attaching the model. I internalized all the breps in one of the two buildings (LEFT).\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1281306", "name": "TypeC.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 6, 2015 at 5:08am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1272017", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1281305"}
