{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nI know I am going through a series of old conversations, but I am trying to hunt down a better way to select zones by their name, rather than using the Ask me component to know that the 10th zone from the top is the \"Closed Brep\" that you need to select with the item selector to pick out that zone.\n\n\n\nHas there been a new updated/added component that I am missing that allows this? In writing my exercise tutorials for some workshops I'm hosting this weekend, one of the phd candidates who is trialing it for me has expressed his frustration that he needs to do these extra steps to figure out which zone is which after he has already named them. In the tutorial, I just have them splitting two zones to show how you can edit one zone separate to the other.\n\n\n\nCheers\n\nElly\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 25, 2016 at 7:39pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1324818", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447226"}
