{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI didn't open your file but I have two suggestions based on the material definition that may help:\n\n1. I think you cannot pass void as one of the materials. If you want to create a perforated metal then I you can create a glass with 100% trans. and pass it as the first material.\n\n2. Make sure to copy perforate.cal to the study folder or give it the full path\n\n\n\nvoid mixfunc\u00a0y_perforation<br/>6\u00a0aluminum airGlass y_hole c:/radiance/lib/perforate.cal -s 0.1<br/>0<br/>1 0.5\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 27, 2014 at 4:59pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1122209", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1122304"}
