{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure where to get any older versions of the components unfortunately, so I got the 0.0.54 Ladybug from your github. It fires up in 442ms, which is great!\u00a0 Honeybee 0.0.55 standard component (not your new one) takes 2.8 minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHope that helps somewhat?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ben Foster", "created_at": "January 20, 2015 at 11:37pm", "created_by": "BenFoster", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1208376", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1208418"}
