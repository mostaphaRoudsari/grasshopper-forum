{"body": "\nCiao Peter,\n\n\n\nthanks for your reply.\n\n\n\nI have already set these parameters: with only one type of window it works fine.\n\nBut when I have to define two or more type of windows (for example: a rooflight and a standard window) in the same room, it seems I cannot control their properties in a smart way.\n\nI could assign each wall/roof of each window manually, but the process becomes too long, especially if I have a complex building.\n\n\n\nI am not sure it is clear my question - please let me know if you need any clarification.\n\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\n\nRiccardo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Riccardo Diaferia", "created_at": "June 03, 2015 at 01:51AM", "created_by": "RiccardoDiaferia49", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1301474", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1301678"}
