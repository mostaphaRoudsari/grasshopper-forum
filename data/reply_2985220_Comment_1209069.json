{"body": "\nHi Marco,\n\nAttached you can find an example file for how to set up blinds with the\u00a0Honeybee_EnergyPlus Window Shade Generator. \u00a0Creating blinds this way will ensure that the surface temperature of the shades is calculated and factored into the energy simulation. \u00a0When you use the\u00a0EPContextSrf component, the simulation is really only checking to see if the sun is blocked by the object and does not compute its surface temperature. \u00a0So, for objects that are very close to your building like an architectural shading device, you should consider using this component.\n\nI hope that helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1209071", "name": "EnergySimulationBase_BlindsExample2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 22, 2015 at 2:16am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1208270", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209069"}
