{"body": "\nDear Theodore,<br/> <br/> I really appreciate your insightful suggestions regarding this matter. I haven\u2019t tried the pollinator yet, but I am testing Octopus component for simple optimization at the moment. \u00a0The reason I am using the evolutionary optimizing algorithm is simply because of the lengthy computational time of brute-force search. <br/> <br/> Once again, thank you for generous help and I will post some video or good images if the study goes well. <br/> <br/> Have a pleasant weekend ahead.<br/> <br/> Kind regards.<br/> Amaraa.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "May 28, 2016 at 9:51am", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537885", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1538136"}
