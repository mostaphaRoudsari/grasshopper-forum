{"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\n\n\nApologies for the late reply on this, I have been trying to sort out some parametric runs. Please find attached a quick example file of some parameters set up to run parametrically. I have only joined 2 up to the mysliders component to make it quicker.\n\n\n\nSimply just want to see if you can make it create all the idfs and then run them all in parallel to each other - instead of having to wait for one to finish before the next can begin.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nElzine\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1373787", "name": "Parametric_Anton.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1373788", "name": "userCustomEPLibrary.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "October 5, 2015 at 10:21pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1373942", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1373786"}
