{"body": "\nHello everyone,<br/>I wanted to have a look at the energy consumptions in rooms with different orientations, so I built two rooms with exactly the same settings but different orientations. Then I got an odd result that the heating energy consumption in the south oriented room is higher than the north oriented one, which I think should be wrong, because the south oriented room should get more solar radiation energy than the north oriented one.<br/>Could you please help me to have a look at my model and help me to know why this happened?<br/>Thank you so much!<br/>Best regards,<br/>Yao\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1343307", "name": "11nobalconyaddlayer2zones.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1343308", "name": "question1.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Yao Lv", "created_at": "August 15, 2015 at 12:18am", "created_by": "YaoLv", "topic": "Why the heating energy consumption in the south oriented room is higher than the north oriented one?", "id": "topic_1343309"}
