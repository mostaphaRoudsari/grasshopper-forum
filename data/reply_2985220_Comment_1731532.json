{"body": "\nAymeric,\n\nThe fact that some of the requested outputs are not in the rdd is normal. \u00a0The \"Generate EP Output\" component requests outputs for all different types of HVAC systems and these are meant to be ignored if no such HVAC system is in the IDF. \u00a0Your issue is happening for some other reason. I imagine that it might have to do with a change that was merged a while back:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/commit/2b455b816b5843b...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/commit/2b455b816b5843bbfbbcf36286f33824e1c8a074)\n\nAnd was later changed:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/commit/e7e75ee765b8d1e...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/commit/e7e75ee765b8d1ede64b73fc2fdd562b885b79e5)\n\nI would try dragging/dropping a new Generate EP Output onto your canvass as one of the inputs to this component has changed in the last month. \u00a0Also, I know that all of your issues would be solved if you just upgraded to the OpenStudio component, which does the same exact thing as the Write IDF component but with the option of specifying detailed HVAC.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 11, 2017 at 9:05am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1731287", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1731532"}
