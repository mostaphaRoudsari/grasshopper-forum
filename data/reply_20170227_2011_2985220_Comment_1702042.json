{"body": "\nFrom Sarith's and Mostapha's opinion on the daysim dgp, I have two questions based on that.\u00a0\n\n1.) Is there anyway to perform annual glare analysis (dgp) without doing a loop in the image based analysis?\n\n2.) If I have dynamic shades control in my building, is there anyway to model it without running the glare analysis in daysim, since the dsparameters require to perform either annual glare analysis only or annual glare analysis and annual illuminance study?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Willy Tsui", "created_at": "February 27, 2017 at 08:11PM", "created_by": "WillyTsui", "parent_id": "topic_1700004", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1702042"}
