{"body": "\nHi,\n\nIs there any simple solution to set surface boundary conditions to have a constant temperature?\n\nI have my zone in question (an atrium) in-between two apartment zones that are assumed to have a constant temperature of say 21\u00b0C. Hence, I would prefer modelling only the atrium with BC's as a constant temperature rather than adiabatic.\n\nIf there is a way to give a whole zone a constant temperature, this would also be fine; I would then just model up these apartments on the side.\n\n\n\nTIA\n\n- Lasse\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lasse Hamborg", "created_at": "October 27, 2016 at 07:29AM", "created_by": "LasseHamborg", "topic": "surface BC: constant temperature", "id": "topic_1627534"}
