{"body": "\nHello again Mostapha!\n\nWhen I attempt to make a custom glazing material it isn't able to run through the ep sim component. The simulation works just fine with default materials, and I believe I've added my glazing to the ep library correctly so I'm not sure what's wrong. The reported fatal error is that it can't \"GetSurfaceData\"\n\n\n\nIf you have a free moment would you mind taking a look at my file to see what I'm not doing right?\n\n\n\nVery much appreciated in advance, thank you!\n\nAaron\n\n\n\n[Further%20Testing2.gh](http://api.ning.com:80/files/TzObvhxOuadWlOaLJ2GOO*wdRTB9p4VCjzBQtNME4jqIlDQ9oBFi5zTU7UM8bfEElMWY7VRu-AJiCtSQlHmK5-MJfPxmQuDa/FurtherTesting2.gh)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "October 21, 2014 at 1:41pm", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "topic": "EP Custom Materials", "id": "topic_1153201"}
