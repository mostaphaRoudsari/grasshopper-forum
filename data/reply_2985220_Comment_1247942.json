{"body": "\nHi Rania,\n\nI use Excel Write component from Lunchbox ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/lunchbox](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/lunchbox)). Use the recorder component to record all the values you require and then after the MOO is complete, export it into Excel using that component. It has a limitation of 5 inputs, you can use multiples of it and export to several sheets and simply copy all the values into one sheet OR determine which column number to start at for each set you export and export them all into one sheet.\n\nCheers!\n\nYassin\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yassin Ashour", "created_at": "March 22, 2015 at 1:51pm", "created_by": "YassinAshour450", "parent_id": "topic_1247620", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1247942"}
