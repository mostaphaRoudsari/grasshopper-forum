{"body": "\nThere is indeed a bug. If you preview the Adjacency you see the zones fine. The faulty preview comes from the HB_decomposeByType component.\n\nBut ... when i open the idf in OpenStudio it is right that all zones are one on the other (The importIDF doesn't like the idf and don't open it, giving a red error \"1. Solution exception:zone_7_Srf_5\").\n\nYou need also to reinsert the 3 last component (runE+, readResults and EPOutput since they changed the number of items).\n\n\n\nI would (please do) report a bug in the github. Reference this discussion.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 15, 2015 at 9:51pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1379258", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1379925"}
