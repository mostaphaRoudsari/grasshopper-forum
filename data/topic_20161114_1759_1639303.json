{"body": "\nHi Everybody,\n\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that I'm fairly new to using Rhino/Grasshopper and especially new to LB+HB. Anyway, I am trying to run an integrated energy + daylight simulation using the provided example file with my DWG file that I've exported from Revit into Rhino, but I'm having a few issues with the geometry.\n\n\n\nA few problems that I'm having with this:\n\n1. I can reference the surfaces to breps by selecting objects (walls, roofs, windows, etc.) that are associated with the imported layers no problem, but cannot create zones from breps\n\n\n\n2. Getting this error, \"Data conversion failed from brep to surface\" when flipping the floor.\u00a0\n\n\n\n3. Window geometry is different in Revit than how they are recognized in HB, what is the best way to make the windows workable in HB?\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny suggestions to help me get started with simulation for this building would be greatly appreciated! Links to my dwg file, gh file, and rhino file I'm working with are down below.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\n[DWG File](https://jamesthomas911-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jkong_glumac_com/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=uOBQPd8TaYqhKHw4Y8ji0Y3JqlzlQIvIfHQrC1ZsINk%3d&amp;docid=19ed8b7bac058454ab68362aadd24a0e2&amp;rev=1)\n\n[GH File](https://jamesthomas911-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jkong_glumac_com/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=gNVGFQAVwU1GZaQ7Au2I7vP4FTKUnit72XjAIOG5uUQ%3d&amp;docid=1b582062b38b84f81a270155bd79d0016&amp;rev=1)\n\n[Rhino File](https://jamesthomas911-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jkong_glumac_com/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=ln4Togvl9Pd60JLCH8eXhWi4Hy5PVFbFFcIHaoB3sHM%3d&amp;docid=10b2ee39e8428414693cf63969d2bea68&amp;rev=1)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeremy Kong", "created_at": "November 14, 2016 at 05:59PM", "created_by": "JeremyKong", "topic": "Integrated Daylight + Energy Simulation", "id": "topic_1639303"}
