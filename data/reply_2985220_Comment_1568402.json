{"body": "\nfor the third question, please look the x-axis\u00a0in the following picture is about azimuth angle. for each azimuth\u00a0angle (90-270) we have some points.The solar radiation differs depending on the tilt and orientation of a surface. the chart is based on the tilt angle and azimuth angle to obtain the maximum solar radiation as well as the\u00a0optimal tilt angle so we need the formulas that have tilt angle and azimuth angle to obtain the solar radiation component.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/v6XxXFfEuuQOcpejDV*zW9PL8zXP-WL36JC*vSRbMDZwx95mNyf5YuczUkJSg3ItAehsgz09PE*1GvrUmpju9O3y6hy3w8la/5.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/v6XxXFfEuuQOcpejDV*zW9PL8zXP-WL36JC*vSRbMDZwx95mNyf5YuczUkJSg3ItAehsgz09PE*1GvrUmpju9O3y6hy3w8la/5.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hamid", "created_at": "July 19, 2016 at 12:04pm", "created_by": "Hamid549", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1568397", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1568402"}
