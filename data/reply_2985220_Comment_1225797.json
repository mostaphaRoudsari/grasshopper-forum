{"body": "\nHi There Anastasios-\n\n\n\nYou know that EnergyPlus and OpenStudio already has the option to perform life cycle assessment, and it has been something I have been looking to put into Honeybee for this year.\n\n\n\nI can't say certainly how to include structural elements inside of a Honeybee analysis, but it is easy to pull out all of the other materials (glass, concrete, insulation) so this gets us part of the way there. \u00a0Also, OpenStudio has something called the Building Component Library (BCL)...google it and you will see that having a common BCL would make it possible for anyone to conduct a life cycle assessment.\n\n\n\nAnother idea that I have been thinking of is having a common file format such that any user, anywhere in the world, can provide us with their EPD or other data. \u00a0Honeybee could then pull all of this data together at simulation time. \u00a0I will write more about this and post my blog on the site. \u00a0\n\n\n\nGreat idea though!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chien Si Harriman", "created_at": "February 17, 2015 at 1:55am", "created_by": "ChienSiHarriman", "parent_id": "topic_1224534", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1225797"}
