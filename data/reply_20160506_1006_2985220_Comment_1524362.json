This is a great component and I've used it to define solar exposure volume successfully (by taking your output to modify epw weather file).\u00a0\n\n\n\nHopefully in the near future this component can be directed to sunpath/analysisPeriod_ so that requested sunVectors could be exported. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your great help!\u00a0\n\n\n\nRegards , Cheney\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Cheney", "created_at": "May 06, 2016 at 10:06AM", "created_by": "Cheney", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1524343", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1524362"}
