{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nFirst of all thank you and Chris for your awesome work. Is incredibly helpful. I will start a new discussion and will upload a short move of my plug-in for Grasshopper. Unfortunately is not of use to upload all of the work since is connected with some local databases that apparently will not work properly in every machine (or at least I didn't figure out how to do it).\n\n\n\nAs a short intro:\n\n\n\nWhat I used there is a data set including life cycle data for light -medium and heavy structural steel. The life cycle data are divided according to Environmental Product Declaration scheme (NEN 15804:2012) and reflect the energy used during the different life cycle stages of the product including the potential benefits for recycling/reuse. This kind of data exist for all different kind of material and the advantage of the EPDs is that you can accumulate data from different material/components for each phase and produce a final EPD for your structure (for example for reinforced steel you have EPD for cement and EPD for reinforced steel so you need the volumed of these 2 materials and then you add the EPD results and you have the final EPD for reinforced concrete e.t.c).\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis is one way to go which is formal and widely used. Part from that as a simpler solution a component calculating Embodied energy and Carbon for each material used in the model would also be great! (I will provide the component for this in the new discussion)\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn any case, I would be happy to help build something in this direction for Honeybee + Ladybug!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 09, 2015 at 04:02AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1220359", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1221150"}
