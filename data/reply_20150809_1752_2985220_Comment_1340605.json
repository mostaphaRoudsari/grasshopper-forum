{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nI can guarantee that a good-looking colored chart will always be produced if you set the Z-Scale of the chart to 0. \u00a0I have tried to add in some extra code to fix the cases that you brought up here for 1 and 2 day intervals. \u00a0Getting the colors of the \"webbing\" surfaces (in between the horizontal surfaces) to match exactly is proving to be a huge mental strain but what I have here should be good enough that most people should not notice it unless they are looking for it. \u00a0If you are really bugged by the slightly different colors, feel free to edit lines 219-239 of the python code. \u00a0If anyone figures it out, we can credit you and change the code.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1340606", "name": "Improved3DChat.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 09, 2015 at 05:52PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1340555", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1340605"}
