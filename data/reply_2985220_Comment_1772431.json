The whole LB/HB community understands how busy you must be trying to develop this and support the users at the same time. \u00a0If I knew python I would surely have helped you. \u00a0Maybe I should learn python and make myself useful here.\n\nCan you share the paper you had published on this subject? \u00a0I may try to take a crack at it.\n\nThanks,\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ibby", "created_at": "June 21, 2017 at 8:17am", "created_by": "Ibby", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1772420", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1772431"}
