{"body": "\nHi maryamamiri,\n\nSorry for responding so late to your issue. \u00a0There were a few things that were not so good in your file but the main one that was causing your issue was this:\n\nAfter you get a zone out of the Honeybee_CreateHBZones, the output is good enough to run through a simulation. \u00a0You do not need to pass the zone through a Honeybee_Mass2Zones component since this component is only made to take raw geometry input and assign zone properties to it. \u00a0Passing a good HBZone through the\u00a0Honeybee_Mass2Zones component effectively turns it back into raw geometry and strips it of all of its zone properties to re-assign new ones. \u00a0This includes properties like windows.\n\nAlso, When you do comparative studies like this, it is important to create your IDF with a different name each time that you run the simulation. \u00a0You can have problems because, each time you run the \"Honeybee_Run Energy Simulation\" component, you are over-writing your previous IDF unless you call it by a different name.\n\nFinally, there is no need to use solve adjacencies when you only have a single zone. \u00a0It is only meant for multizone cases.\n\nSee attached for a corrected GH file.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1209029", "name": "glassfacadeenergysimulation_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 21, 2015 at 4:25pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1204122", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209027"}
