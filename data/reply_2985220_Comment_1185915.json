{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nMy apologies. You are right. I get confused with a previous discussion where importing IDF files don't take the shading control.\n\nSaying that, correct me again if i'm wrong, now that you mention this, i don't think midplane blinds is a different animal (it is an animal but not so different). In the ShadingControl section you can choose the BetweenGlassShade for the blinds. Your ShadeGenerator allows only interior/exterior, but the midpane can be implemented. It is true that if your window construction is not well defined weird things can happen ... but the possibility is there.\n\nBTW, this is how DesignBuilder does it.\n\nThanks for proving me wrong :-)\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 10, 2014 at 10:40pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1181641", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1185915"}
