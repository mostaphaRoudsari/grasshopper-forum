{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\n\nThe idea of checking if the user has assigned the input sounds like the right approach. I know that we have a method for construction to check if it is set by user but not sure about the loads and schedules.\n\n\n\nEarly on, honeybee was designed not to assign any construction, load or schedule to the zone until the write components because I was thinking to use the space level assignment but then it faded out. The main reason was the confusion of getting None values for unassigned properties. There was no good way to check the inputs before writing them to idf. Admittedly, it was mostly because I didn't know how to handle this in an elegant way.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 23, 2017 at 8:58pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1802666", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1802583"}
