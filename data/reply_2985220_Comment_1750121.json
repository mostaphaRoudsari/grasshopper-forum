{"body": "\nHi Carmelo,\n\nAll studies that you run using the Honeybee microclimate maps will automatically account for solar radiation falling directly on occupants and the subsequent increase in occupant MRT as a result. \u00a0The microclimate maps are using the SolarCal model, which was just officially accepted into the ASHRAE-55 Thermal Comfort Standard and is described in detail here:\n\n[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/89m1h2dg#page-1](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/89m1h2dg#page-1)\n\nExample files with the microclimate maps include the following:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Microclimate_Map_-_Simple&amp;slide=1&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Indoor_Microclimate_Map&amp;slide=1&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Comfort_Autonomy&amp;slide=1&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\nI should note that the microclimate maps make a few assumptions about the occupant for the solarCal model (for example, the occupant is always seated and is always facing towards the south). \u00a0If you want to drill down into details of the solarcal model, you can use the Ladybug_Solar Adjusted Temperature component as seen in this file:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Accounting_for_Solar_Radiation_in_Comfort&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\nMore info on the methods used by the microclimate maps can be found here:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/initial-doc...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/initial-documentation-of-thermal-maps)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 11, 2017 at 2:13pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1749242", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1750121"}
