{"body": "\nAlejandro,\n\nMostapha could provide a much better answer here but I know that the \"glareCheckImage\" that you get out of the Glare Analysis component should be the same thing that the radiance mailing group is talking about. \u00a0If you look at this image, you will see colors that indicate \"glare sources\" and, if there are colors around/on the building you are studying, this should give you a sense of whether the building is responsible for the glare. \u00a0I am afraid that you are probably going to have to stick with this qualitative analysis since the subtracting of DGP values doesn't sound like an accurate method. \u00a0The one quantitative thing that you can say is that, if the DGP with the building present is greater than 0.45, you definitely have some glare issues that you should address.\n\nAs for the simplified methods, I am 99% positive that Honeybee is not using these. \u00a0I can at least assure you that the\u00a0Glare Analysis component is using a full rendering. \u00a0I have heard of people making very rough estimates of whether glare is possible from illuminance values and it sounds like that is what the radiance group is referring to. \u00a0You should definitely not compute a DGP value from just illuminance, though, as that is bound to be inaccurate.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 2:15pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1273951", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1278971"}
