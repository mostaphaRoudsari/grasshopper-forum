{"body": "\nBack to Q2, updating to the latest version solved the issue. The reason that the analysis fails when you use .csv file for heating setpoint schedule is that EnergyPlus is looking for a dualsetpoint schedule. If you use the same file for other schedules (e.g. occupancy) it will run fine. I will check about the possibility of generating custom .csv schedules for a case like this. I attached the updated file we should work fine with setpoints.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1177001", "name": "testRoomQ_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 28, 2014 at 12:46am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1176805", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1177000"}
