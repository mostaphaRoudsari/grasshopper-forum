{"body": "Chris's suggestion is the best: Not good to mix versions of LB+HB with the different components.\nSo the best is to start over from the example and apply your changes\nor\nUpdate the different components in your example. From your image i see that the E+Run component is from Sept 15, and i recall that the HB is from January 11.\nYou can also use the HB/LB updater components to do this dirty job for you (in case you have many components to update).\n-A.", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 13, 2015 at 07:39AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1203295", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1203740"}
