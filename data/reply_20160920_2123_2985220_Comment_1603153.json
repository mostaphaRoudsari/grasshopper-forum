{"body": "\nJust checked your file and it runs fine on my machine after changing the weather file address. Here are my suggestions:\n\n1. Download the latest version of Ladybug + Honeybee! You're using an older version.\n\n2. Move the weather file to a different folder with no\u00a0~Arquivos and Arquivos Clim\u00e1ticos. I'm not sure that can be the problem since the sky seems to be generated correctly but just to make sure that's not the reason.\n\n3. Set working directory to \"c:\\Ladybug\" and pick a _radFileName_ with no space.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 20, 2016 at 09:23PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1603140", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1603153"}
