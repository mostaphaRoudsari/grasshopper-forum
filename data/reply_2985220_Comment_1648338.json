{"body": "\nTheodoros,\n\n\n\nI use the Brute Force component to iterate through all list combinations. It appears to be identical to fly, so it may not speed things up. I haven't found a way to use lists directly.\n\n\n\nIt sounds like the process of rebuilding a unique model/file for each iteration is what is slowing you down. For 360,000 combinations it probably makes more sense to\u00a0manipulate the idf or rad\u00a0file directly rather than rebuild each time. Maybe use GH to build each unique geometry option, then manipulate the files to add the simpler changes, such as material options. I haven't done this myself,\u00a0but in theory it could save time.\n\n\n\nThis may be down the road a while, but Sarith and I have recognized that\u00a0our iterative models have an outrageous amount of redundant calculation because we treat each model as a unique run. If we only change the glass type and no surfaces, the internal\u00a0and external calc haven't changed, only the fa\u00e7ade. Why waste time calculating the same thing over and over? Consider DaySim. It\u00a0uses\u00a0one DF matrix to calculate the internal bounces and then adjusts the skydome to calc each unique hour. No redundant internal calc. We need a similar method designed for iterative calculations. Re-use as much of the previously run iterations as possible. 360,000 runs could be shrunk to a fraction of that. What are your thoughts? 5-phase calc method is an obvious fit for massive iterations.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "November 29, 2016 at 8:33am", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "topic_1647993", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1648338"}
