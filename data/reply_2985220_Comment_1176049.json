{"body": "\nGood, thanks! I have another question about the adiabatic surfaces, the way I undestand it since there is no heat transfer though them their interior temperature should be the same as the interior air temperature, right? I am asking this because I set some surfaces in my building as adiabatic and when I assessed the internal temperature during a winter week some of the adiabatic surfaces turned out to be among the coldest surfaces in the building, which does not make much sense to me.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "November 26, 2014 at 9:00am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1175834", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1176049"}
