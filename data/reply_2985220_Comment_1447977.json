{"body": "\nHi Elly,\n\n\n\nThanks for the reference, I'll check it out! Actually, that is my next step, doing Daylight assessment of interior in the buildings and outdoor comfort maps using Chris's excellent work. I'm thinking to use DF (and also use it for light penetrration), DA/UDI, and maybe solar envelope analysis. However, I am intending to reduce the alternatives by a lot given the time required for daylight simulations. Also, I will calculate VSC on window surfaces as a criterion. Final step would be CFD of site configuarations (having multiple batches of buildings).\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 8:58pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447868", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447977"}
