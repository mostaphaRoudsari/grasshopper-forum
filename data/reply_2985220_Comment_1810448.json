{"body": "\nHardi,\n\nIt is possible to do this in EnergyPlus/OpenStudio and, to do this with Honeybee, you would either need to add additionaStrings_ to the OpenStudio component that add in solar panels to the IDF OR add the panels manually in the OpenStudio Interface. \u00a0Alternatively, you could search for an [OpenStudio measure](https://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/getting_started/about_measures/)\u00a0that adds PV and apply the measure to the model in the OpenStudio interface.\n\nAll of this said, you might be able to get the most control over the input variables by using the Ladybug Renewables components to model the PV separately from the full-building energy model. \u00a0If Djordje Spasic is around on the forums (he's the author of the components), he can probably show how to model the tracking system that you have in mind.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "on Friday", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1810197", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810448"}
