{"body": "\nHi Vinu,\n\n\n\nYou can use Python's json library to do it. For creating .csv file check this post:\u00a0[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/279#issuecommen...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/279#issuecomment-74621002)\n\n\n\nYou can send the data with zone names and then filter data on D3 side. check for \"filter\" in javascript.\n\n\n\nAlso I'm curious to know what are you trying to do. Are you trying to create a set of visualization for a specific work or is it for more generic purpose (e.g. interactive energy simulation results visualization?) I'm planning to do more work in that area soon as an extension for Ladybug+Honeybee, and there might be areas that we can work together.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 28, 2015 at 08:27AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1274924", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1275236"}
