{"body": "\nJoe,\n\nI am nearly positive that this has to do with an older HB_HB that you have flying on another GH canvass. \u00a0I was able to run the file that you uploaded at the start of this post and import it into THERM:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/9e-LbPNbsUsFd86U40pi9SY-EynuMvyskg5Bj9hkgygz249lyxfOIMUz8Pkj68ObPyzt6G8VEXDkY5M-aoo6fMXaDX1RVZgL/ImportToTherm.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/9e-LbPNbsUsFd86U40pi9SY-EynuMvyskg5Bj9hkgygz249lyxfOIMUz8Pkj68ObPyzt6G8VEXDkY5M-aoo6fMXaDX1RVZgL/ImportToTherm.JPG)\n\nIt seems that your curved edges were not translating well, though. \u00a0I would strongly suggest making all of your geometry as polygons and not curves. \u00a0Curves do not exist in the THERM world and the method that Honeybee uses to translate them is not always ideal.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 13, 2017 at 4:58pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1711424", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1711366"}
