{"body": "\nHello all\n\n\n\nI created \"select items\" and picked the spaces with air walls and assigned \"AIR WALL\" material to them. Now my air walls and interior walls are correct and I checked the labels. However, there are other issues with my file now:\n\n1) first, I want to ask if the way that I did this task was the most efficient way. Because it took me around 2-3 hours to assign spaces with air walls and separate them from other spaces and find interior walls. I had one floor plan with 31 spaces.\n\n2) Since I fixed my air walls and interior walls by using Find Adjacency, my file crashes and freezes and it is not operating well. i could not run a Grid Based DL simulation because it crashed all the time.\n\n\n\n3) One thing that I did different from Chris's E+ tutorial was that I added glazing before finding adjacencies. Please tell me if that is the reason that my file is crashing.\n\n\n\nChris, Mostapha, and HB group members, would you please look at my file and tell me if I am mistaken? My final target is to apply \"integrated daylighting and energy simulation\" to my floor plan. Now, I am concluding that \u00a0it is very hard to do that when you have multiple zones. Please tell me if I am wrong.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your help. I really appreciate your support.\n\nladan\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1646245", "name": "AirWallsDiagram.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1646246", "name": "HB_SolveAdAirWalls.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 25, 2016 at 2:10pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1645068", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1646244"}
