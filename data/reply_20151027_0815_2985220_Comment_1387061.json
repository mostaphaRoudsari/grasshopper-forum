{"body": "\nHi all and sorry for being late to this discussion.\n\n\n\nOne thing here to remember is until we implement 3-phase method annual analysis are running using Daysim which introduces limitations in using multiple CPUs.\n\n\n\nIf you're fine with a little bit of coding, a quick solution that I used before is to use the shared drive in the office and ask people to run a batch file on their systems \u00a0in background (which can be automated). The way it works is that the script generates all the batch files in the same folder. Then the batch files in other systems are looking for new available batch files and execute them. You need to manage the results to be saved in different folders. It's similar to how clustering computers work. You can read more about it in this paper. I used this approach to run annual daylight simulations for a master plan project overnight:\u00a0[http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/asim2012/0097.pdf](http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/asim2012/0097.pdf)\n\n\n\nFor long-term solutions I hope OpenStudio team set up their cloud-based services generic enough that we can use it also for Honeybee.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 27, 2015 at 08:15AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1382634", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1387061"}
