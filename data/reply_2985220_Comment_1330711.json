{"body": "\nDaniel,\n\nA: you can do with no problem. This is actually what i wrote before.\n\nB: As far as i know (and i think i know), is not possible. But beyond that, doesn't make sense for me. Anyway, in E+ you can set the starting day of the month and the end day of the month for the run period. In this sense you can simulate one day. If you do that with an hourly timestep you can get hour by hour of this day. So you can get 365 separated days.\n\nThe warming up can be set as Mostapha recommended in a different discussion (link above).\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 22, 2015 at 6:36am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1330450", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1330711"}
