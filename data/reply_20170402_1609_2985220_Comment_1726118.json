{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI bumped in some kind of a bug with this updater. Sometimes it works fine (and i like it very much) and sometimes it doesn't ... sucking all the memory of my computer and i need to kill Rhino. The update \"never\" ends and i can see how the memory use is increasing in the process. I don't know how to debug and report in a more useful way ...\n\nJus can say that it happened in 2 different files where i use the genCumulativeSkyMtx and related. I see the rhino screen updating repeatidly, but as i said, it doesn't stops.\n\nIf you have any ideas how can i be more helpfull with this one, let me know.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 02, 2017 at 04:09PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1725695", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726118"}
