{"body": "\nHi\n\n\n\nFor many years now Radiance's text based system has permitted 'sets' of materials to be created which have a similar base definition but might be modified slightly differently - perhaps due to their placement in the building.\n\n\n\nI have created a radiance material file in the Ladybug directory with a bunch of material definitions. I note that any the have alias in them cause the Honeybee \"Fly\" component to have conniptions...\n\n\n\nI am guessing we need to think through how these base definitions might be subsequently modified by another GH module?\n\n\n\nIs there any guidance somewhere on this?\n\n\n\nm\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Michael Donn", "created_at": "May 2, 2017 at 6:51am", "created_by": "MichaelDonn", "topic": "Radiance definitions using 'alias' and 'inherit'", "id": "topic_1744249"}
