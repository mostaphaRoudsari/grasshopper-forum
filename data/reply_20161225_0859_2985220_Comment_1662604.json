{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nYour implementation of Julia's method as per Chris's suggestion is great. In the attached file, I propose we use the list of HOY you created instead of the\u00a0typical analysis period. I have made some preliminary modifications to the component to do that. What I have done is a very temporary fix. I believe, we should think about building this capability to take such a list in this WindRose component.\n\n\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1662605", "name": "04_WindAnalysisNightHours_Edit.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "December 25, 2016 at 08:59AM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1662382", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1662604"}
