{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if there was a simple explanation for a problem I have been having with getting surfaces to be evaluated. In the work that I was doing I was seeing surfaces that would not run, and when I changed the surface type in your sample file from \"Ceiling\" to \"Roof\" that surface does not display in the output.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI connected the Color Surfaces component to your model and all surfaces displayed. Changing nothing but the surface type of the ceiling to Roof, that surface disappears.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIs there something I am missing that is telling certain surfaces not to be included in the E+ calculation?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks,\n\n\u00a0\n\nJamison\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jamison Caldwell", "created_at": "October 12, 2015 at 02:58PM", "created_by": "JamisonCaldwell", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1376500", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1377764"}
