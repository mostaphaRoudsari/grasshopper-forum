{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am testing baseline systems with Honeybee with OS. I created a very simple zone in energyplus and import the idf in Honeybee. Baseline system 5 is setup with components. then The OS errors says in the screen shot. Please help me! My file is also attached.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat is the work flow for importing idf with thermal zone information only and create the HVAC system in GH ? Does it need to solve\u00a0adjacencies again ?\n\nThank you\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LkGF0iu9CPx-gWnmwa-DxiQ8-JRqw2P8gkc6F1NX5jG10wpveJ*r-7dHeBvxB77gOOunOWMlv--cpSqPgDG*4Rhc8pOcqD*Y/ErrorMessage.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/LkGF0iu9CPx-gWnmwa-DxiQ8-JRqw2P8gkc6F1NX5jG10wpveJ*r-7dHeBvxB77gOOunOWMlv--cpSqPgDG*4Rhc8pOcqD*Y/ErrorMessage.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1500962", "name": "GH_OS_Test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Bo Lin", "created_at": "April 04, 2016 at 03:49PM", "created_by": "BL", "topic": "Errors with Writing OS File", "id": "topic_1500963"}
