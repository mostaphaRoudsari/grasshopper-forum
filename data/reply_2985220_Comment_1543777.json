{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThe blinds on the link i sent are not really \"blinds\". They are like a roller shade, where you can control the distance between each slab. The thickness of the slab is just a few milimeters so it is not a regular horizontal element where you can set the angle. It is more like the image of Ernesto but instead a lot of small holes you have a \"big\" horizontal ones. Which it was my intention when i mentioned this. Like you can set the transmittance of the roller shade.\n\nBut anyway, it can be added an as issue. The option you mention will be really nice (scheduling the angle).\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 7, 2016 at 9:26pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1543764", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1543777"}
