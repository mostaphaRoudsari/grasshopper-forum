{"body": "\nThanks, Mostapha. I was able to resolve that issue.\n\nHowever, I have another question for you. I have the lighting schedules created by the daylight simulation and now I am trying to plug this into the Open Studio simulation. But I am getting this error (see below). Could you tell what I might be doing wrong? The Open Studio simulation runs fine without the lighting schedule though. I have also attached the gh file.\n\nMany many thanks!\n\ns\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0k1PGPsOMFJUsaH9aIGkUfOB0jZOYFEC2QL4CS15QTT1UCNC3dudRXLXNwKUETv5IXocEUjLEOUufL0Kmqh-FFirNU6GhRUE/error.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0k1PGPsOMFJUsaH9aIGkUfOB0jZOYFEC2QL4CS15QTT1UCNC3dudRXLXNwKUETv5IXocEUjLEOUufL0Kmqh-FFirNU6GhRUE/error.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1437719", "name": "EnergyDaylightModel3.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Saurabh Shrestha", "created_at": "January 12, 2016 at 07:37PM", "created_by": "SaurabhShrestha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1433793", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1437718"}
