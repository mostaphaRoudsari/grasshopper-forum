{"body": "\nClaudio,\n\nI am now happy to say that Honeybee officially supports OpenStudio 2.1:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/commit/8748a4b6b9f52c1...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/commit/8748a4b6b9f52c11e37de4941b3e40813324f2cb)\n\nI have gotten everything working on my end but let me know if you encounter anything while you try it out, Claudio. \u00a0The first time that you run Honeybee_Honeybee with OpenStudio 2.1 installed, some supporting files will download in the background and you should make sure that you are connected to the internet for this. \u00a0After that, you should be fine to use Honeybee with OS2.1 without internet.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 17, 2017 at 7:33pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1733183", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1734601"}
