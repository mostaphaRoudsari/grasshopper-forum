{"body": "\nHello Antonello,\n\n\n\nHaven't tried it yet but this looks amazing! You are right that in certain occasions, especially where the height differences are great (e.g. more than 20 meters or even less sometimes) in the landscape then they should be included in CFD studies.\n\n\n\nSo far I have been using sketch up to do very much the same thing and then import it to Rhino, which probably uses a similar method. Unfortunately, between downloading and importing to Rhino the final maps often have issues with scale and quality of terrain. This can hopefully resolve all that and the need for using two different software.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, thanks for sharing!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "August 18, 2016 at 09:13AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1583923", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1583933"}
