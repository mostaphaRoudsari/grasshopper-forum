{"body": "\nHi Antonello,<br/><br/>Your Terrain Generator component is also using the System.Net.WebClient class, which does not work on my PC.<br/>So I can not test your component at the moment, but the issue you had was strange.\n\nI have changed _geometry and _terrain from \"ghdoc object\" into \"No type hint\" in order to use your components because my terrain surfaces weren't recognized.<br/>...<br/>Now it works fine also without changing the type of input.\n\n<br/>When do \"Terrain Analysis\" and \"Flow paths\" components work for you, and when they do not? Can you attach and internalize the specific terrain surface which forced you to change the input hints?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "October 01, 2016 at 09:18AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1609129", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1608907"}
