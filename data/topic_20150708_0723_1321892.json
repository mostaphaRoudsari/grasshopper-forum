{"body": "\nMostapha,\u00a0\n\nSorry about posting all these bugs, I dont mean to be a nuissance. I keep comming across some irregularities and I think posting them will be ultimately helpful for the develpment of this amazing design tool.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo after updating another one came up. The _location input in the 'ladybug sunpath'' is generating some errors in internal calculations.\u00a0\n\nI tried eliminating the first line (\"Location, London\\Gatwick etc) to have one less argument but then the component doesn't unpack the location info properly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI've included an image. Let me know if I can help out in something.\u00a0\n\n\n\nkind regards,\u00a0\n\n\n\nMauricio\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1321891", "name": "0.0.60 Location.png"}], "created_by_name": "Mauricio Aguilar Cardenas", "created_at": "July 08, 2015 at 07:23AM", "created_by": "MauricioAguilarCardenas135", "topic": "BUG LadyBug_Sunpath", "id": "topic_1321892"}
