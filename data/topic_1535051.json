{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm trying to run an energy simulation for a model in a hot climate where there is natural ventilation until a certain internal and external temperature, and when that temperature is exceeded i want the ventilation to be interrupted and an air conditioning system to be activated. I would also like to know how to set the temperature that the air conditioning system will keep the internal environment.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSorry for the bad english, not my native language, and thank you all for the attention.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1535050", "name": "Model.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Allyson Carvalho Silva Santos", "created_at": "May 22, 2016 at 4:51am", "created_by": "AllysonCarvalhoSilvaSantos", "topic": "Basic question about running an energy simulation using natural ventilation and air conditioning system", "id": "topic_1535051"}
