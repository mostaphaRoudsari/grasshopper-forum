{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Ilona,\n\n\n\nThe simulation you are running is point in time illuminance. In order to get .ill files for daylight autonomy, you need to run the Honeybee_Annual_Daylight_Simulation instead.\u00a0\n\nThen you can use the Honeybee_Lookup Daylight Folder component which will give you the location of the .ill files.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\n\nByron\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "byron mardas", "created_at": "December 21, 2015 at 9:17am", "created_by": "byronmardas", "parent_id": "topic_1424594", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1424598"}
