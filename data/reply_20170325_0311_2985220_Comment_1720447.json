{"body": "\nI have never tried that so I'm not sure. I'd bet it won't work out of the box since I'm not sure how you can tell BF to look into a native Linux installation. That doesn't mean it is impossible just possibly not doable atm. However, I think it would be quite inefficient way to run things.\n\n\n\nMy above answer was concerning this sentence\n\n\n\nOr can I even set up a case on my Windows Laptop and use the seperate Linux machine (or maybe even an Amazon EC2 instance) to run the OF calculations?\n\n\n\nThis is certainly possible with the use of BF I described above. Concerning AWS instances, I am about to find out this week hopefully when I'm going to try my first cloud OF run. Will let everyone know if I do.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 25, 2017 at 03:11AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1720530", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1720447"}
