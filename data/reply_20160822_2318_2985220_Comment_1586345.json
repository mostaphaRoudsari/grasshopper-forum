{"body": "\nHello!\n\n\n\nThanks for this major update! Can't wait to get my hands-on pedestrian comfort analysis component!\n\n\n\nJust saying, is it possible to keep the Run E+ sim component in the future versions? I mean, the tool already has this component and it is very useful in generating initial part of the model in GH and later fine tune it in IDF Editor. It will be great if it can be retained!!\n\n\n\nThanks again for the update and looking forward to more of them and ofcourse, Butterfly!!\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nRam\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ram Joshi", "created_at": "August 22, 2016 at 11:18PM", "created_by": "RamJoshi", "parent_id": "topic_1580355", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1586345"}
