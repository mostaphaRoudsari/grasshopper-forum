{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew where to find the times that shades were down throughout the year. I have two shading states and I want to plot them for each hour of the year into a plot like the one below.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/IHl76p8Qjsv1Pt8di5cR6B2e*A12MZeEorTiRWeYwcM-KgnwBTc4RdKJ9Ynsb-UhN-hml-hOApliyJWyO7krnpZBVXFW5M67/ShadingPlot.jpg\" width=\"748\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/IHl76p8Qjsv1Pt8di5cR6B2e*A12MZeEorTiRWeYwcM-KgnwBTc4RdKJ9Ynsb-UhN-hml-hOApliyJWyO7krnpZBVXFW5M67/ShadingPlot.jpg)\n\nI found one csv file in my annualSimulation folder called Space_0_intgain\" that had shading data, however it was all zeroes and said that the shades would be manually operated by the occupants, despite me specifying illuminance thresholds for the shades to close.\n\n\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nThanks Everyone ^_^,\n\n\n\nJohn Keyes\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Keyes", "created_at": "May 2, 2016 at 7:25pm", "created_by": "JohnKeyes", "topic": "Shading Question", "id": "topic_1520806"}
