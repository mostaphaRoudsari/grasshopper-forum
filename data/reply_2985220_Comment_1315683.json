{"body": "\nAlejandro,\n\nI would strongly recommend using the Honeybee_EnergyPlus Window Shade Generator component for this case. \u00a0Using the context surface component will not calculate the surface temperature of the louvers in the energy simulation, which can have a large effect when the blinds are close to a window. \u00a0Geometry put into the context component is only used to tell whether a given context surface blocks the sun (not surface temperature) and so it is meant more for things such as surrounding buildings and trees.\n\nThis said, I looked at your error. \u00a0It was happening because you were sending null values into the component. \u00a0I have made sure that the component does not fail in this case in the attached file.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1315685", "name": "HB_EContextSurfaces_IssueCWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 25, 2015 at 9:16pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1315856", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1315683"}
