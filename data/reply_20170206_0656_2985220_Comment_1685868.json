{"body": "\nHi guys\n\n\n\nRhino does not use independent installations of IronPython, but they can conflict with the version loaded from Rhino's installation folder. As such, you should **not** install different IronPython versions to begin with. [See more information](https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/ironpython-installation-rhino-5-rhino-wip/40927).\n\n\n\nIf required, then rather install the exact version that you are using with Rhino, or disable the **GAC option** while installing.\n\n\n\nBesides, \\N is not a good character escape. It should be \\n. \\n is a new line escape. [\\N is undefined](https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html), even in Python 2.0, and as such, can create issues. I am not an expert regarding under which conditions an error will be raised for this problem, rather than being silently ignored.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Piacentino", "created_at": "February 06, 2017 at 06:56AM", "created_by": "GiulioPiacentino", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1685818", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1685868"}
