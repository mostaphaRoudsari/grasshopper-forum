{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nSorry for the late reply. \u00a0I think that starting with fan driven ventilation is a good idea as the window-based auto-calculations are fairly simple at the moment and really only good for a few zones at a time (we're currently working on implementing the whole airflow network, which will allow you to evaluate really complicated cases). \u00a0To clarify, you set the _fanFlowRate on the set EP Airflow component here:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-FxrWMrAPzgXXFIljp1SATv-uLyvQj5b2GNlKXCSQzjgA6mODUJfAgt3kF0EL11VMxhmT5mlMz79Avp0jb*X1PXqgEwUcoPa/FanFlowRate.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-FxrWMrAPzgXXFIljp1SATv-uLyvQj5b2GNlKXCSQzjgA6mODUJfAgt3kF0EL11VMxhmT5mlMz79Avp0jb*X1PXqgEwUcoPa/FanFlowRate.JPG)\n\nThis flow rate is meant to be the total outdoor air flow rate in m3/s that you want to enter the zone when the indoor temperature rises above the \"minIndoorTempForNatVent_\" (it is not divided by the floor area). \u00a0This fan flow is completely separate from the\u00a0\"Set EP Zone Loads\" component, in which case the\u00a0ventilationperArea values that you input here refer to the minimum outdoor air that you want to come in through the mechanical ideal air heating/cooling system. \u00a0Iif your zone is not conditioned, these ventilationperArea values will have no effect. \u00a0The minimum ventilationperArea\u00a0is built into the default ideal air systems to ensure that the occupants do not suffocate or (more likely) smell each other's body odors. \u00a0In contrast, the fan-driven natural ventilation on the\u00a0set EP Airflow component is done to cool down the space instead of using a traditional mechanical cooling system.\n\nLet me know if this clarifies everything.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 02, 2015 at 03:51PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1277007", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1278901"}
