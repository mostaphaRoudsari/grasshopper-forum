{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nFor some reason it still wouldn't work with your example - when I set 0 as the body posture it says 'Solution exception:len() of unsized object'.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOk, I look forward to seeing the MRT output in the component! If you need me to test anything let me know - I know a bit of Python as well, so I could help out.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nReinier\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reinier Zeldenrust", "created_at": "November 06, 2014 at 05:41AM", "created_by": "ReinierZeldenrust", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1158469", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163179"}
