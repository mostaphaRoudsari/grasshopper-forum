{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nJust an update: I came to the office and the Fly! component was finished. It too 264 mins to run 354816 different combinations. 4 hours isn't that bad but this quickly grows out of hand when having a few million of combinations.\n\n\n\nCould this be related to the way I save the combination lists? Due to the way recorders save data, I use the old concatenate / text split trick to actually save each parameter value in one list which I later merge with entwine to create the data frame. This is the only way I have so far to create all combinations (concatanate/text split create one unique string at each iteration assuring all are created).\n\n\n\nIs this taking too much processor time? Is there a better GH native way to save these lists? Is it even better if I have a code like yours above saving all combinations?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "November 29, 2016 at 07:24PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1648563", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1648592"}
