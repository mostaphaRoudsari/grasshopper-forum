{"body": "\nHi Claudia,\n\nThis time you have set the tolerance to an extremely small number. Set the tolerance to 0.001 and re-run the Grasshopper script. Energy simulation runs fine on my machine.\n\nTo avoid issues with single windows in your example I suggest to break down the very long walls with multiple windows into smaller pieces in Rhino. You can use splitFace command and draw some vertical lines between them. That will make meshing much easier for Honeybee.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 10, 2016 at 11:57am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1434172", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435926"}
