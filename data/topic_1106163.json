{"body": "\nI have a sphere covered in test points (testPts) that are used for radiation analysis with the \"radiation analysis\" component.\n\n\n\nI can color and \"weight\" each test vector (testVec) using the vector display Ex component to show the magnitude of solar radiation on each point, as demonstrated in the attached images.\n\nThis is already cool, but the vector information i am looking for relates to the more complex relationship between a given test point, and the multiple number of sky patches it \"sees.\" For each patch, there should be a corresponding vector, and some radiation contribution.\n\n\n\nI would like to color and scale each of these vectors to illustrate the direction and contribution of the sky patches on each test point. \u00a0This would result in a more cactus-like outcome, with each test point sprouting a collection of \"spikes,\" with each spike oriented directly at a particular sky patch in view.\n\n\n\nHope this makes sense, any suggestions if (A: this is possible or not) and (B: how to do it) would be appreciated.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1106161", "name": "Screen Shot 2014-07-24 at 11.33.22 PM.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1106162", "name": "Screen Shot 2014-07-24 at 11.35.19 PM.png"}], "created_by_name": "Octagon26", "created_at": "July 25, 2014 at 12:46am", "created_by": "Octagon26", "topic": "Visualizing all vectors for test point and klems patches it \"sees\"", "id": "topic_1106163"}
