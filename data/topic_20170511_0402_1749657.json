{"body": "\nHello, <br/> <br/> I am working on some research project that deals with daylight and energy simulation, thus I was working on the model on GH. But the surface type of createHBSrfs doesn\u2019t match with the outputs of Honeybee_Decompose Based On Type component, thus the consistency of the model becomes loose by the visualization and I am little bit concerned about the model and simulation result.\n\n<br/> For example, srftype input for floor that touches ground, 2.5 \u201cSlabOnGrade\u201d \u00a0in createHBSrfs doesn\u2019t recognized as groundFloors on the decompose based on type rather its seen as exposed floor.<br/> <br/> <br/> Does it really matter when doing energy simulation when the EPconstruction type is same?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1749655", "name": "1.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1749656", "name": "2.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "May 11, 2017 at 04:02AM", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "topic": "Surface type consistency", "id": "topic_1749657"}
