{"body": "\nHello Guys,\n\n\n\nI took the definition in this discussion( [http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/glare-analysis](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/glare-analysis))\n\nThe idea is to illustrate the galre risk of a given Srf that is in front of a glass building. I\u00a0manage to create a mesh that displays the risk of glare over the whole year.\n\nBut now my client asks if its possible to have a false color image (like evalglare) from the interior of the building looking towards the glass building in order to evaluate the possible glare at a working station. I guess using HoneyBee I'll be able to get that glare analysis.\u00a0\n\nWhat will be the method to evaluate the glare over the whole year?\n\nHow can I\u00a0contro\u00a0the reflectance of the glass building within a HoneyBee_Radiance_Glass Material\n\n\n\nThank you all in advance\n\n\n\ncheers\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "October 14, 2014 at 8:18pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "Glare analysis according to a reflectance % of a glass panel", "id": "topic_1149112"}
