{"body": "\nHi Abraham, Let me report first what I have done so far and then give a suggestion.\n\nI compared the skies and the difference is acceptable. The 145 values are the values for 145 different sky patches. You can see that specially for patches that involves higher values (direct sun) the differences are happening but they are not major. Here is the results for the whole year:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/14StazH4QF7f56iLY9*Di3tJYVUrzaD8c3EbpnENRX5foDe9W0qHHPjzyURilGQDZwB7ZAhWAEGQosyPbYGgSyfGvljv8X*b/skydiff_0.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/14StazH4QF7f56iLY9*Di3tJYVUrzaD8c3EbpnENRX5foDe9W0qHHPjzyURilGQDZwB7ZAhWAEGQosyPbYGgSyfGvljv8X*b/skydiff_0.png)\n\nThen I set-up a box and run the analysis using Ladybug vs Honeybee. Here is the results.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/14StazH4QF4QFjg3wEi8VYNXU6I60NJjbTbk*c5Du2MhPBw4YiN-K3W0fyYibxBmrZIv8rrbnHxvCdxjx7SCm-*DsyPTkK6C/results_0.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/14StazH4QF4QFjg3wEi8VYNXU6I60NJjbTbk*c5Du2MhPBw4YiN-K3W0fyYibxBmrZIv8rrbnHxvCdxjx7SCm-*DsyPTkK6C/results_0.png)\n\nFinally I connected the analysisPeriod that you were using and you can see the difference in sky is higher and as expected the results is a more different between Ladybug and Honeybee but still close.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/14StazH4QF6rpg*ZTmcwOKdcYiBbebeJ3t2d*c6Qyj9wLG6gBLs1WuaO571DbPVc*VUPxJ2NGh*l-nevi-HxiA1Dmwy8YUmq/skydiff_1.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/14StazH4QF6rpg*ZTmcwOKdcYiBbebeJ3t2d*c6Qyj9wLG6gBLs1WuaO571DbPVc*VUPxJ2NGh*l-nevi-HxiA1Dmwy8YUmq/skydiff_1.png)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/14StazH4QF76DQQUcjjYj3W4RSNf3owiakk2On13K5WvoeJLxUJmjxn7vb8Ke4bqmqkzPLd6qnppvpQpNBEUPZ09OkYbsOWP/results_1.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/14StazH4QF76DQQUcjjYj3W4RSNf3owiakk2On13K5WvoeJLxUJmjxn7vb8Ke4bqmqkzPLd6qnppvpQpNBEUPZ09OkYbsOWP/results_1.png)\n\nHere is my suggestions:\n\n1. Can you integrate your geometries into this workflow so we can compare point values with point values. I attached the definition.\n\n\n\n2. Do you mind to open a new discussion for the second issue. It's very hard to follow all these discussions on the same thread.\n\n\n\nPS: Gencumulativesky is developed by Darren and Modified by Christoph and is part of Daysim's distribution vs gendaymtx which is recently developed by Greg Ward for Radiance daylight coefficient methods. I understand gendaymtx much more since it gives you the results for every single hour and then you can add them up for cumulative sky however gencumulativesky just gives you the total results.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 9, 2015 at 9:23am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1376003", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1376176"}
