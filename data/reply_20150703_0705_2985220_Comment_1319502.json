{"body": "\nDaniel,\n\nFirst of all Chris of course can help :-)\n\nSecond, your simulation crashes before it even started to make the calculations. You can see the panel connected to the report output of the simulation component. There you can see that there is a lot of severe problems with the pre-calculations E+ does before the start of the simulation. See that the problems relate to the Glass definitions. So my bet (almost sure) your definitions are faulty.\n\nThird, in your materials library you are giving the same name to the glass material and the window construction. You need to make them differently.\n\nFourth, just for the sake of what i wrote above i've just defined a EPWindowMat and construction. Hooked them to the right places and the simulation runs fine. So i think that i made my point with this as for the second item above.\n\nSee attached, low left corner, red group and arrows.\n\nJust one more thing, i would try to copy a couple of glass material definitions from the E+ library, just to see if they work. If so, you can be sure your definitions are somehow wrong.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 03, 2015 at 07:05AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1319575", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1319502"}
