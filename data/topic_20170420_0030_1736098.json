{"body": "\nIt seems that with or without a transmittance schedule the effect of a horizontal shading surface (HB context surface) on the cooling loads of a room is the same.\n\n\n\nThis is how I define a transmittance schedule for a HB context surface:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/*VTYACbMdusextZZSz8ndxw0JYdixlZXxZ0DEYgqRbdY*0yPQLQUnQzGVMdcvTrYFvjyLeErVrfN1QSwklmsmywW1yfiSmWe/Image42.png\" width=\"661\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/*VTYACbMdusextZZSz8ndxw0JYdixlZXxZ0DEYgqRbdY*0yPQLQUnQzGVMdcvTrYFvjyLeErVrfN1QSwklmsmywW1yfiSmWe/Image42.png)\n\n\n\nIsn't that a shading surface with relatively higher transmittance value, e.g a much porous or transparent surface, will have less shading effect, resulting in higher cooling loads, as compared to one with lower transmittance (less porous or less transparent)?\n\n\n\nAppreciate your advice.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "April 20, 2017 at 12:30AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "[unable to reproduce issue] transmittance schedule of shading surface doesn't affect cooling loads", "id": "topic_1736098"}
