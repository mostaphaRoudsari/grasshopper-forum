{"body": "\nI have attached the file with everything internalized. Probably best to open the one that says (Simulation Off) as the other will just run when opened and it is a pretty long simulation.<br/>\n\nThis is a study for a wall where we want to analyze its openings. I made a parametric wall that then get's analyzed with different geometries and the idea was just to leave it there for the weekend as it morphed through different iterations.<br/> <br/> However, after successfully running a test simulation on my pc (just with one iteration), it fails to run the same test on the workplace computer.
