{"body": "\nHi again!\n\n\n\nIt's a bit embarrassing but I think I found my problem. I think at first I had different versions of components in the same model when the update function only updated some components. Then in my search for the error i reinstalled all programs and accidently missed to install radiance under C:\\. I noticed it now when I tried to do the gridbased analysis when it complained about not finding anything in the C:\\Radiance\\ folder.\n\n\n\nMy bad :( Thanks alot though for taking the time to answer my question and also a big thank you for your work!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carl Molander", "created_at": "November 26, 2015 at 06:38AM", "created_by": "CarlMolander", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1410061", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1410212"}
