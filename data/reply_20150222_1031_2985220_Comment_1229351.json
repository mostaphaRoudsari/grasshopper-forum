{"body": "\nHi Burin,\n\nIt was an issue on our side. You set everything right in your model.\n\nApparently EP also overwrites north direction in level of buildings once coordinate system is set to absolute. I changed the system to relative and it works fine now. Thank you for reporting this. Fixed both on github and the attached file.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1229352", "name": "03_NorthPar_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 10:31AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1229414", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1229351"}
