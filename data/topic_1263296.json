{"body": "\nHey Guys,\n\n\n\nI have a typical floor plan that we are trying to analyze to determine different glazing ECMs (glazing type and WWR). I'm noticing that the results from the Ideal Air Loads runs are showing very high heating demand (~350kWh/sm/year for example with a 2009 IECC glazing construction), also with the cooling demand high as well but not as equally outrageous (~50 kWh/sm/year). We were expecting something in the 25-30 kWh/sm/year range for heating and cooling loads each. \u00a0I've double checked all inputs and they seem to be legit. Any idea for these high loads? So perplexed.\n\nI was hoping to be able to add a mechanical system to the model to get actual energy demand, not just the load. \u00a0When I used the component to change the mechanical system to one of the other off the shelf systems, the total thermal energy demand was not affected at all. \u00a0Was this because I did not have an air side and a plant side component plugged into the mech override component? What I was hoping to be able to do was to set a base off the shelf mech system, similar to the E+ example files that come with the E+ download. \u00a0Am I missing something?\n\nAlso, it seemed to consistently get errors when reading the surface data from the glazing. \u00a0I was unable to determine if this was causing the heating error.\n\nWe've modeled all of the zones around the perimeter as conditioned, and the core and plenum as unconditioned. \u00a0The floors are modeled as adiabatic. \u00a0Attached is the model and the gh script. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny help would be awesome.
