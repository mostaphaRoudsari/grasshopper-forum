{"body": "\nHi Peter and Abraham,\n\nI think I have this thing finally fixed [By think I mean I hope!]\n\nCan you please try the attached file and let me know if it works fine for you now. I'm so ready to see there is still something missing! I wish Daysim was a little bit more user-friendly.\n\nIf this once works fine then next move is to address Peter's wish ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/236](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/236)).\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1199255", "name": "testbox0610_elchrom_msr_2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 5, 2015 at 10:33pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1171535", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1199254"}
