{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you for your quick reply.\u00a0\n\nI tried setting useOldResult to false but I continue to get the same result. I am not sure what the issue is. Do you have any other idea what this could be?\n\nAlso just wanted to say thank you for all the great tutorials you made on youtube with the exception of the radiation one (per the issue I am having ) they have all \u00a0been amazing! I am learning tons!\n\n\n\nMelissa\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "September 27, 2016 at 02:10PM", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1605019", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1606685"}
