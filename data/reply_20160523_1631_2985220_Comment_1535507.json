{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nYeah I've tried that a bunch of times.. I tried to attach the files before but the site is buggy at the moment.. i'll try again now.\n\n\n\nI played with the geometry for A WHILE until I finally got 6 zones each composed of surfaces that some have windows etc. I separated the surfaces and windows into parents and children and re-joined them into 'closed brep' legitimate HBZones.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, the simulation doesn't run when they are connected and says that the index is out of range.\n\nWhen I connect only one of the HBZones it works. More than one it doesn't. Weird.\n\n\n\nAgain, i'm trying to attach here the script and internalized geometry in hopes that someone can understand this...\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yafim Simanovsky", "created_at": "May 23, 2016 at 04:31PM", "created_by": "YafimSimanovsky", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535564", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535507"}
