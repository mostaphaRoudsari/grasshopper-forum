{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI get now where is the source of the Internal Heat Gain. It comes from the StrategyPar component. So the polygon extend from the lower limit of the comfort polygon until the bldgBalancePt.\n\nAs the hint of the bldgBalancePt says it assumes a rather good insulation and a large number of internal heat sources (which can be proper for maybe office buildings or schools) to get to the default 12.8C default value. I would say that, going to the other extreme (low loads and no insulation) we can assume something like 16-18C?\n\n\n\nIndependent of that i think that the PSH polygon should extend to the comfort one and not just to the IHG, as for instance the cooling strategies do.\n\n\n\nPlaying with the PMVComfortPar PPD thershold can also illustrate the differences between building types (for instance offices should be 10 and residential can be 20). For the purposes of explaining the meaning of the strategies polygon sizes.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "September 4, 2017 at 2:26am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1808244", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1808531"}
