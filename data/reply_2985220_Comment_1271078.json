{"body": "\nHi Joyce,\n\n1. Make sure you have GHPython installed on your system and is unblocked. Read this discussion carefully([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/ladybug-ins...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/ladybug-installation-problems)).\n\n2. Check the attached file for Hong Kong's sunpath. There are a number of tutorials on sunpath if you google for Ladybug sunpath which should help you to get started. The one that I recorded is pretty old and the component has changed meanwhile.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ZAWmPnMuulnf01YJKvGOIBewaFLuwJw0QedphCcWrOgYoQ2cgSd7axW-jF1enuHTc3t1V1RfMUqSIMeSc*3P-2LsEl2AD8TU/HongKong_Sunpath.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ZAWmPnMuulnf01YJKvGOIBewaFLuwJw0QedphCcWrOgYoQ2cgSd7axW-jF1enuHTc3t1V1RfMUqSIMeSc*3P-2LsEl2AD8TU/HongKong_Sunpath.png)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1271080", "name": "sunpath_hongkong.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 23, 2015 at 8:33am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1271046", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1271078"}
