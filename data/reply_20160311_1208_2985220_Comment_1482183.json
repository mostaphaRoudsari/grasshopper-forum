{"body": "\nThanks Chris,\n\nI understand the concept and the logic behind it, I'm looking to treat each Brep in the array as it's own building, not zone, so i can study the overall impact at the site energy consumption level as it relates to window-wall area ratio and orientation. if there was a way to pass breps as \"buildings\", so you can study different options simultaneously, instead of zones, that'd be awesome...but I understand if this isn't possible.\n\nthanks!\n\n\n\njoel\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Joel Yow", "created_at": "March 11, 2016 at 12:08PM", "created_by": "JoelYow", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1482291", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1482183"}
