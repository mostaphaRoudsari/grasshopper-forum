{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI love you man. I was hoping to see at least a couple of people backing me up on this, but unfortunately nobody did and I felt that what I was asking for is something superfluous.\n\nYou understand me, thank you so much for this tiny feature, my life is complete for now.\n\n\n\nI just updated LB's user objects and checked the new sweet feature but it didn't work. Is there something I forgot to check? I didn't touch HB and I didn't forget to update all the LB components on the canvas as well as change the old component with a new one. I also tried to play with the inputs to no avail. I tried to download your file and see if it works, but it was the same.\n\nI usually use Wireframe top view with white background if this can help. As I get it you let rhino change background color to transparency?\n\n\n\nCapture view components is awesome, I always use it to capture stuff in rhino. I'll wait for your reply to see if I can help to solve this issue.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "April 11, 2016 at 10:55pm", "created_by": "Timur582", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1505995", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1506631"}
