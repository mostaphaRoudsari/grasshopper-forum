{"body": "\nHi Letizia,\n\nMaybe we should break down this discussion into multiple discussions so it is easier to follow. I personally have a hard time to track all the issues in a such a long discussion.\n\nBack to\u00a0additionalStrings_, I agree that it will be ideal to be able to overwrite current EP objects if you input the same object but it needs various number of checks to find the correct object that should be overwritten.\n\nWhy do you need a none program for the zone? In case none of the default programs matches your schedule you can add your own schedules to Honeybee and load them for the simulation. If you check Ladybug's default folder there is a file named as \"userCustomEPLibrary.idf\"_ Copy all your schedules, constructions, etc. in the file and they will be loaded into Honeybee library when you let the Honeybee fly.\n\nBack to your issues the first one looks like an issue with order of execution of components, and I will check your file for number two.\n\nI still suggest to break down your questions/wishes into separate discussions so we can make sure to address all of them.\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: In case you have standard schedules, and constructions for European countries we can probably add them to default library.\n\nPSS: I'm coming to Rome this summer!
