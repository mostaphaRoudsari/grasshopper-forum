{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI ve been using the VSC component extensively from some studies, and I would like to ask the following:\n\n\n\nI get the \"Non Plannar Vertex for Polygon\" alert during the analysis for some of the geometry I reference.\n\n\n\nDoes that mean that those parts of the geometry are not considered as context blocking the sky in the analysis? Or is it just a performance alert.\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nDimitris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "July 14, 2014 at 12:37pm", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Vertical Sky Component  Non Plannar Vertex for Polygon", "id": "topic_1102124"}
