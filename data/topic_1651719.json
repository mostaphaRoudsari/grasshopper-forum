{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nIn my model, I generate context surfaces in two places. One to generate shading devices, the other to create surfaces for PV panel installation.\u00a0\n\nWhen running the EP simulation, I get the error **duplicate name** for the context surfaces. Is there any way to solve this, for example, can I create a list of unique names to assign to the list of surfaces?\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Willem Vandervoort", "created_at": "December 4, 2016 at 5:52am", "created_by": "WillemVandervoort", "topic": "Duplicate name of context surfaces", "id": "topic_1651719"}
