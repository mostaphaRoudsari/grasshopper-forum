{"body": "\nThanks or the response.\n\n\n\nI looked at the Import Stat Component and while it provides some good information, I'd like to be able to define what an extreme temperature would be.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo further the discussion, I've setup a conditional statement with the Solar Path Component where the direct radiation is above 630 and the temperature is above 18. I'd like to take that time where those conditions exist and plug it into the Radiation Component.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIs there a way to extract the time period of the conditional statement, in this case form the Sunpath Chart, and plug it into an analysis period for the Radiation Analysis?\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reid Weber", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 01:49PM", "created_by": "ReidWeber", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749206", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749522"}
