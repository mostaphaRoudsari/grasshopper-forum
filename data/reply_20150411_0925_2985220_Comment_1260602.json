{"body": "\nHi Giuseppe,\n\nI checked your file and I admit that I still couldn't understand what are you exactly trying to do but two comments in general. 1. Output of sunlight hours component is already grafted based on input mesh faces so you should be able to match the data. 2. You can use Grasshopper's unflatten component to graft the data of a faltten list based on a grafted reference input.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 11, 2015 at 09:25AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1259923", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1260602"}
