{"body": "\nHi Ji,\n\nNo much help from my side. I recreated your results.\n\nPlease reinsert the HB_EPOutput. The number of inputs changed. The truth is that the HBgeneration_ dissapeared and i don't know where you can get the effect of this one back now.\n\nI also inserted, and used the new LB_**updateGHFile**. It shows more updates that the normal one doesn't catch (for instance the EPOutput).\n\nI assume Chris will check thoroughly why the outputs are not consistent, but my question is why you can't use the OS outputs instead the E+'s? At the end both of them are running E+.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 19, 2017 at 7:26am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1735592", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1735846"}
