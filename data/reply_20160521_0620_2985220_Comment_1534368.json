{"body": "\nHi Chris,<br/><br/>I am glad that the microclimate map recipe for PET has been released! Thank you for investing your time in creating it.<br/><br/>My apologies for missing the Dragonfly project.<br/>I haven't checked the Town Energy Balance, but I have no doubt that it's a valid project. Keep up the great work, and again, sorry for the misinformation.<br/><br/>The gratitude lies on behalf of the author of original Fortran PET code: Dr. Hoeppe. From my side I should thank the Fortran to C convertor.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "May 21, 2016 at 06:20AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1532162", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1534368"}
