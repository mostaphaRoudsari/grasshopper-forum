{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThis is great. Thanks!!\n\nThere is something that i don't get fuly and is related to the contribution of the Internal Heat Gain\". I didn't find the assumptions for this one, but as it is in default values, it's influence is huge, which i'm not sure is correct.\n\nThe second thing, also regarding these gains, is when i don't want to take it into account as a strategy. Then you get a void between the comfort polygon and the passive solar heating, which i'm pretty sure can be added to it. At all, shouldn't it be drawn up to the comfort polygon instead to the internal gain's?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/YPA*pXPx9w4J0BtDgPcwSGaF*6jdUbU1EChL5y3112qw8ho9p*vbErCdlmVRTsUs7d*ptHsndPIEMp3kX6WGIESpzfnQyF2n/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/YPA*pXPx9w4J0BtDgPcwSGaF*6jdUbU1EChL5y3112qw8ho9p*vbErCdlmVRTsUs7d*ptHsndPIEMp3kX6WGIESpzfnQyF2n/Capture.JPG)\n\nLike it very much.\n\nThanks again.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "September 4, 2017 at 1:58am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1808434", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1808244"}
