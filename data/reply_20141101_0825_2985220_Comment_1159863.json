Update it to at least Rhino 5 SR5. If you can not,\u00a0[download](http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5/latest) the Rhino 5 evaluation version. Also be sure to use the latest (0.9.0076)\u00a0[Grasshopper](http://www.rhino3d.com/download/grasshopper/1.0/wip) version.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "November 01, 2014 at 08:25AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "topic_1159921", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1159863"}
