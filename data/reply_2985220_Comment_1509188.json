{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI think your function which projects points on plane through vectors (also not perpendicular to projection plane) is the best solution in this cases, a great function!<br/>I've played a bit with your system, to make the same thing you need to use some native components of GH,\u00a0only this could be a problem for someone.\n\n\n\n<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ZuR8thm*Gj*4xopOpXTS*TgcWSMIw3m*Toe0yqPwwoqo3bMTtTryPEnOmMPT3OIjpE2tmdUD8V5ZKOA47dQYhkmcLE7g9843/MostaphaMethod.png?width=450\" width=\"450\"/>\n\nAnyway, we could continue to work at our shading system, probably, something of interesting could born.\n\n\n\nBest<br/>Antonello\n\nPS. Another thing, I'm looking forward to see your idea about \"schedule components\".\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "April 15, 2016 at 5:15am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1506640", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1509188"}
