{"body": "\nHi Simone,\n\nYou can do this with Ladybug, although I will admit that the current workflow for this is not ideal and is more time consuming than necessary. \u00a0In the future, I plan to make a component that can do this easily and quickly using a method that I wrote into the solar temperature adjustor component (right now this is only working for a mannequin mesh and not any geometry that you want, though).\n\nAttached, you can find a file that shows you how to do what you are asking. \u00a0Be prepared to wait ~10 minutes or so until the slider finishes animating. \u00a0In the future, you should be able to do this in parallel and this will get the run time down to a minute if your geometry is simple.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1150897", "name": "Hourly Radiation Values With LB.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 17, 2014 at 02:14PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1149748", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1150895"}
