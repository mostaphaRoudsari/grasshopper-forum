{"body": "\nHi all, i'm trying to check the diference of\u00a0illuminance between a passive and active user for some variations of building elements: window size, shade type and size, orientation of building and numbers of shades. For that i used static blinds for simulate the passive user and the dynamic blinds with Honeybee_Advanced Dynamic Shading Recipe for active users. To see the results i'm using\u00a0 Honeybee_Read Annual Result II to see the results between the custom range of 500 to 5000 lux, i could do all the variations of elements that i wanted for the passive user, but when i started using the Honeybee_Advanced Dynamic Shading Recipe i keep getting a error with Honeybee_Read Annual Result II and cant get any result. It works fine with Honeybee_Read Annual Result I, but i can't change it to show me the range 500 to 5000lux. There's a way i can see this result? Also, i used the excel to calculate the UDI for the static blinds, there's a way to calculate that for the dynamic blinds?\n\n\n\nThank you all!!!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1709933", "name": "mandar para o forum.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Allyson Carvalho Silva Santos", "created_at": "March 11, 2017 at 7:44am", "created_by": "AllysonCarvalhoSilvaSantos", "topic": "Problem with Read Annual Daylight Results II", "id": "topic_1709934"}
