{"body": "\nYes there can definitely add an input for a landscape.\n\n\n\nWe should take care though with SHM since this mesh is kind of awkward to create with the way SHM works. The reason is the ups and downs of the landscape, it means that on the edges (sides, inlet, outlet) there are parts of the bounding box that will be 'outside' of the final mesh. If we mesh it as an outside case, the final mesh will be invalid because it will have surfaces on all sides (probably) extruding outside the volume.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOne way to go around this is to treat the wind tunnel case as an internal case. This would mean splitting the bounding box with the landscape and discarding all the leftover bits \u00a0from the bottom\u00a0on all sides. Then the final geometry is treated like a huge 'room'. \u00a0So in the final boundary file there should be all the masses added by the user, the landscape added by the user, the new split sides, and the top.\n\n\n\nSometimes, depending on how big the model, the additional volume in the blockMesh that would be required to be built around this 'room' in order to mesh it (much like we do in the indoor cases) has quite a cost in terms of memory.\n\n\n\nI can add an example of this in the weekend.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "August 18, 2016 at 9:42am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1583652", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1583745"}
