{"body": "\nAlexander,\n\n\n\n1) You do not need to have EP constructions to run any of the daylight or Radiance analyses (it is only for EnergyPlus) and so you should not have to change anything to run simulations with the Honeybee_Vertical Sky Component.\u00a0 You are already good to go.\u00a0 Also, as I recall, the VSC component has not changed in over a year - only the Ladybug skyView component changed recently.\n\n\n\n2) You should definitely stick with the most recent release as I can assure you that this issue will not be any different depending on the version.\n\n\n\n3) The not downloading of files if you already have them is intentional since you want to still be able to use Honeybee when you are offline and have installed everything already.\n\n\n\n4) I only added the [userCustomEPLibrary.idf](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/resources/userCustomEPLibrary.idf) as an optional resource recently and this does not have anything to with the [OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/resources/OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf) that you need to run EP.\n\n\n\n5) I am getting the correct 1,723 KB file when I go to either of Grasshope's links ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/raw/master/resources](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/raw/master/resources)), click on OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf, then right-click in View Raw and select \"Save File As\".\u00a0 Are you saying that you do not get this when you follow the same workflow?\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 11, 2016 at 12:47pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1480304", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1482466"}
