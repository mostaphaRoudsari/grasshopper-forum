{"body": "\nHi Mahsa,\u00a0\n\n\n\nBy using the current GH workflow, do you come across any successful case in which both\u00a0sDA300lx,50% and ASE1000lx,250h below 10% can be fulfilled and LEED v4 credit could be achieved? Out of my curiosity, I desperately like to see a building which can fulfill LEED v4 requirement by balancing sDA and ASE successfully.\n\nRegards,\u00a0\n\nCheney\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Cheney", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 1:04pm", "created_by": "Cheney", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1401223", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519160"}
