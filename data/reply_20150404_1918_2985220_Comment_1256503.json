{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\nThank you for replying, your videos on Youtube are amazing btw, thanks also for those.\n\nI have been trying to carry out a full size energy simulation for a commercial building attempting LEED.\n\nThere are 7 storeys and over 200 thermal zones. (no typical floors)\n\nThe machine I am using is an i7 with 32GB RAM.\n\n\n\nI have also tried to isolate operations and internalising data in BREPs after each long computation. I found that HB is good for around 30 thermal zones and the maximum size is around 60.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Daniel Mak", "created_at": "April 04, 2015 at 07:18PM", "created_by": "DanielMak", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256191", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256503"}
