{"body": "\nHi Dan,\n\n\n\nSorry I didn't get back to you earlier.\n\n\n\nBasically, I extracted the maximum and minimum of whatever domain (e.g. daylight factor) I was interested in, remapped the values of the domains to the default (0 to 1). Following that, you simply input the new range into the color gradient, which translates the 0 to green as in the case above, or 1 to red. I have attached the script that I used for my thesis which include the other tools that were set up as part of my thesis. Please let me know if you need anymore clarification.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-Yassin\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1466832", "name": "Tools documentation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Yassin Ashour", "created_at": "February 19, 2016 at 2:08am", "created_by": "YassinAshour450", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1461734", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1466831"}
