{"body": "\nHi Mostapha!\n\n\n\nGreat job, and thanks for the amazing new tools for Indoor Comfort!\n\n\n\nI just wanted to mention a small thing. Some components give an error warning when dropped into the canvas, that asks for a new version of Ladybug, even though it is updated. Deleting and re-inserting ladybug, then re-inserting the components seems to solve the issue.\n\nSmall nuance, just a heads up.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 04, 2015 at 03:49AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1216749", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1216893"}
