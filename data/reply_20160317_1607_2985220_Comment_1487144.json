{"body": "\nLuis,\n\n\n\nI apologize for such a late reply.\u00a0 The shade generator component can start to freak out when you give it sun vectors that are close to being perpendicular to the window surface (since these sun vectors cannot be blocked with shade surfaces that are perpendicular to the window).\u00a0 I would suggest one of the following:\n\n\n\n1) Do not using the sun vector input if you are going to use very low sun angles (just use the depth)\n\n2) Angle your shades so that it is possible for them to block the low sun.\n\n3) Use the shade benefit evaluator component to visualize the sun you want to block instead of the shade generator component.\n\n\n\nMostapha might do a revision of the sun vector methods of this component with the new version of Ladybug since it is related to geometric view factor calculations that I know he has been planning to rewrite for a while.\u00a0 I am sorry that I can't offer a better solution for the time being.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 17, 2016 at 04:07PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1480710", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1487144"}
