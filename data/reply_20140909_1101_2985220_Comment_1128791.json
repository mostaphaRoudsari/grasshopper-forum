{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha,\n\nEverything works now and I ran a simulation through the energyplus component. My question now is: energyplus had to break up the curved geometry in order to run it through the simulation, and the\u00a0output returned with 141 surfaces because that, but how do I identify where each of those surfaces is located in the model (ie: where exactly is\u00a0GLZSRF_64_SRF_DUP_GLZP_64 located within the 3d geometry?). I initially thought that the Honeybee_Label Zone surfaces would do this but it doesn't seem to work for the (formerly) curved geometry, is that true?\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nAaron\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "September 09, 2014 at 11:01AM", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1128554", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1128791"}
