{"body": "\nHi Will, Thank you for posting this as a new discussion. I can get back to you with an example at some point next week but if you want to give it a try yourself the trick is to generate series of vectors in all different directions (instead of only one looking +Z), and use them to generate new set of test points (which will have the same XYZ for point and different XYZ for vector). Then run the analysis and average the values for same test points. This should give you what are you looking for.\n\n-Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 23, 2015 at 4:08am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1206895", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1210119"}
