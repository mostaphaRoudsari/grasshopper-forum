{"body": "\nClaudio,\n\nThe Window Shade Generator has been in need of some major edits for a while and I was planning to set aside a weekend where I would implement the following on the component:\n\n1) Add the ability to model interior fabric shades and exterior perforated screens (not just blinds/louvers)\n\n2) Add the ability to model electrochromic glazing\n\n3) Add the ability to have the shading controlled by radiation or temperature setpoints\n\n4) Get all of these shade capabilities to work with the OpenStudio component (as well as the EnergyPlus component).\n\nI am sorry that I have not had the time to sit down and do this sooner. \u00a0I will try to take care of it either this weekend or the next and I will post here once it is finished unless Anton is able to take this on. \u00a0Also, great job, Anton! \u00a0You are becoming a master of the code!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 07, 2015 at 10:47PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1413725", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416975"}
