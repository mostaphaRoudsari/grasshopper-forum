{"body": "\nDear bee and bugs,\n\n\n\nI got some strange results when the **target building geometry** is not included as part of the **context geometry** for the **Sky View** simulation using the **View Analysis** component:\n\n\n\nThere is no such problem when using the same workflow for Sky Exposure simulation.\n\n\n\nI assume the target building itself will be automatically included as part of the context geometry due to consideration of self-obstruction ...\n\n\n\nHope you can kindly advise!\n\n\n\nThank!\n\n-Ji\n\n\n\ntarget building is not connected to \"context\" input node:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/a4JBf1Z8ExbkXTOaBaLQ5b2eqmSBbj5yLxucq8C43Muua9VKh6AeaD70r4UaLelv8ncskAsdCjiYLWn6-Iz1SkBDsR-J7DRV/Image1.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/a4JBf1Z8ExbkXTOaBaLQ5b2eqmSBbj5yLxucq8C43Muua9VKh6AeaD70r4UaLelv8ncskAsdCjiYLWn6-Iz1SkBDsR-J7DRV/Image1.png)\n\n\n\n\n\ntarget building is connected to \"context\" input node:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/a4JBf1Z8ExZ2Hlyq4m1bHLu76fSgN4AZbxe0jO9Z1rsihhKAUmG77-WuZTkeBl4V86CfMT1p1OKuEzaXV-Rr9JfS7ar1mnZm/Image2.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/a4JBf1Z8ExZ2Hlyq4m1bHLu76fSgN4AZbxe0jO9Z1rsihhKAUmG77-WuZTkeBl4V86CfMT1p1OKuEzaXV-Rr9JfS7ar1mnZm/Image2.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1623620", "name": "view analysis problem _v002.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "October 23, 2016 at 3:01am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "[clarified and updated] Sky View simulation results are strange when target building geometry is not included as part of the context", "id": "topic_1623407"}
