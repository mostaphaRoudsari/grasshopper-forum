{"body": "\nHi Leland, If you are concerned about the results of the study, the component that you already have is generating accurate results. The bounds that you see in visualization is because of multiplying the values with stradian angles to plot the kWh/m2 values. The angles are going up and down for each raw and are making the bounds. As you can see once I remove them and plot the sky for kWh/m2.str the sky looks as expected. I'm not sure what is the best way to address this issue for visualization but as far as it is related to the results the current numbers are correct.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 23, 2014 at 10:37pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1191666", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1194310"}
