{"body": "\nHi Mohamed,<br/><br/>Thank you for the kind words.<br/>I actually haven't tried doing that, but I think it is possible.<br/>One way might be to directly calculate the\u00a0[conductive heat transfer](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/heatcond.html) through the roof/facade construction beneath the PV array.<br/>I the attached an example below, of residential wood roof construction filled with insulation layer in between the roof rafters:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/O7rpupHifA3aTS79oqvnMc0wD7uZuCwczXP-2QhioOK5e*h1bg19L14Azz4YMqq2nblwEqiPzY3Ie*TK*usbqJGQnFuoPoc9/roofSection.jpg?width=200\" width=\"200\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/O7rpupHifA3aTS79oqvnMc0wD7uZuCwczXP-2QhioOK5e*h1bg19L14Azz4YMqq2nblwEqiPzY3Ie*TK*usbqJGQnFuoPoc9/roofSection.jpg)If \"heatGainPerYear\" output is negative (like in attached .gh file for Calgary) it means the PV's are not increasing the heat gains of the room beneath them. But that again depends on the room temperature, which you could alter with \"Tinside\" input.<br/><br/>Have in mind that this kind of calculation is only valid for \"moduleType = 0\" (insulated back PV module):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/O7rpupHifA3hdNd5yRijeP0*THmujcOORhD9n49SYZ4W4SoLu-Q6VXkxwZUAWRhTShrr8ixjM1QGCxbhvedeIGx10xEMjp-T/moduleType_0.jpg?width=200\" width=\"200\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/O7rpupHifA3hdNd5yRijeP0*THmujcOORhD9n49SYZ4W4SoLu-Q6VXkxwZUAWRhTShrr8ixjM1QGCxbhvedeIGx10xEMjp-T/moduleType_0.jpg)\n\nIn cases of \"close roof\" and \"open rack\" mount types (moduleType = 1,2,3), probably some cfd simulation would have to be performed to get more precise results.<br/>\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1431330", "name": "heatGainPV.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "January 5, 2016 at 3:12pm", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1430996", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1431329"}
