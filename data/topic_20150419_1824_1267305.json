{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI've constructed a building from different zones. \"HB intersect masses\" and \"solve adjacencies\" worked perfect, as you can see in the files.\n\n\n\nI then created additional zones for the external skin (and the cavity between them and the building). I had to separate them by floor due to thermal accuracy (but that's not the issue), so there are 44 of those (lowest brep on the left, named \"double skin\").\n\n\n\nHow do I control the glazing correctly, i.e., external skin is glazed only on external faces, and inner skin remains glazed, WHILE solving adjacencies?\n\n\n\nThanks!!!!!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1267303", "name": "4.17 SIM.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1267304", "name": "008_Honeybee EnergyPlus Simulation Shai+Seung.gh"}], "created_by_name": "s", "created_at": "April 19, 2015 at 06:24PM", "created_by": "s122", "topic": "assigning double skin facade- adjacencies", "id": "topic_1267305"}
