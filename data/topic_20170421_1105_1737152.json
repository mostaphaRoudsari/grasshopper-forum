{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI'm unable to turn off the psychometric chart mesh and only preview the graph axis elements. Can you tell me why, when I turn off the \"preview\", the colored mesh doesn't disappear? I've also attached my file.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8u9*hkKvZQTj-j-aE3zG3GYC5710FrtCNQFH6Yz2zUUyYQWabl802jDghUl8TVEAuymCm2jiAiq0iLXMiiII*Se5zeX5pG4N/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/8u9*hkKvZQTj-j-aE3zG3GYC5710FrtCNQFH6Yz2zUUyYQWabl802jDghUl8TVEAuymCm2jiAiq0iLXMiiII*Se5zeX5pG4N/Capture.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1737151", "name": "Psych Chart - Trials.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Reid Weber", "created_at": "April 21, 2017 at 11:05AM", "created_by": "ReidWeber", "topic": "Psychometric Chart Preview \"off\" not hiding mesh", "id": "topic_1737152"}
