It seems there is no error with velocity results however pressure values are too low (4 pa max). I have seen that you have added some correction to result values, e.g. for pressure values,its -273,15 pascal(can be seen in the image). But with that correction, you just see negative pressures in all of the domain. Because the values you get at first are too low. So whats the reason that you need to correct the values coming from OF? \u00a0I assumed that the values from OF should be multiplied with 10(power of 5) then atmospheric pressure (101325 for 15 C degree) should be subtracted from these values. I tried that but the latest values were not reasonable.\n\n\n\nSecondly, I couldnt find output files which can be opened in Paraview, did you get the file from butterfly run?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/tELt8V-QL1BOJS5is*qYDPP29g-vF0mGysUmEePWhPRawq6*zQyAxh*zCi7vrJ4hyqzmTkmw971kyPNRjLfymf0yzIv5MrVc/case.JPG?width=561\" width=\"561\"/>](http://api.ning.com/files/tELt8V-QL1BOJS5is*qYDPP29g-vF0mGysUmEePWhPRawq6*zQyAxh*zCi7vrJ4hyqzmTkmw971kyPNRjLfymf0yzIv5MrVc/case.JPG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1659340", "name": "case.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "anarchitect", "created_at": "December 17, 2016 at 9:09am", "created_by": "mimarilker", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1560558", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1659338"}
