{"body": "\nawkweird,\n\nHoneybee currently only supports E+ v8.1. \u00a0Normally, we try to keep everything up-to-date with the DoE but, between 8.1 and 8.2, EnergyPlus underwent an enormous translation from the original FORTRAN language it was written in to C. \u00a0In the end, this will be great since so many people know C more than FORTRAN. \u00a0However, there were a lot of bugs in the first translation and we wanted to wait until the DoE team worked through a few of them until we upgraded. \u00a0It seems that we will do this soon, judging by our conversation:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/203](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/203)\n\nIn the meantime, you do not need to downgrade your EnergyPlus. \u00a0You can install 8.1 and 8.2 side-by-side.\n\nTo fix your second issue (if installing the correct E+ does not fix it), make sure that you are connected to the internet the first time that you drag the Honeybee onto the GH canvass.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 12, 2015 at 05:07PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1222707", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223742"}
