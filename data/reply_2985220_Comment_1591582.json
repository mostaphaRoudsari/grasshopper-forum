{"body": "\nHi Antonello,<br/><br/>I like the new radius input !<br/><br/>Indeed meshes are the best representation of the terrain, that's why I used both meshes and surfaces as outputs.<br/><br/>When surface is interpolated through a grid of points it may slightly deform (buldge) due to nurbs tendency to create a smooth surface. Mesh terrain on the other hand will be always be a bit more precise representation of the raster from which it has been created, as it will be consisted of a series of independent faces made from the grid of points.<br/><br/>Btw, you do not have to use the \"Delaunay mesh\" component.<br/>You can create a rectangular mesh by calling the Ladybug meshFromPoints method:\n\nimport scriptcontext as sc<br/><br/>lb_meshpreparation = sc.sticky[\"ladybug_Mesh\"]()<br/>terrainMesh = lb_meshpreparation.meshFromPoints(numberOfPtsIn_vDirection, numberOfPtsIn_uDirection, pts)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "August 31, 2016 at 3:14pm", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1591064", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1591582"}
