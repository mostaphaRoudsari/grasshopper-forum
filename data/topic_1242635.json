{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI am a new user to grasshopper and ladybug, and I have ran into a problem when I try to use the Ladybug ''bounce from surface'' component to do a reflected sun study.\n\n\n\nI would like to trace the sun rays that bounce off of the ****_SourceSrfs**** geometry and strike surrounding ****context_**** geometry.\n\nAt the same time, I do not want to trace any sun rays that are blocked by ****context_**** geometry, nor any sun rays that bounce off of the ****context_**** geometry first and then strike other ****context_**** geometry.\n\n\n\nThis should be consistent with the stated functioning of the component, but it appears that the component does not discard blocked sun rays.\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0****context_****\u00a0geometry info bubble states the component will reflect sun rays **AFTER** they bounce of the**\u00a0_sourceSrfs\u00a0**. The behavior seems not work work like this.\n\n\n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vRWi3e17RGqoovml3KFyI17nNpH2ucmBbGUxZ-YAr23N9AS6Z1oqCbZs*6qpd9KjZafN2W6TlKcpoD9iGDEtOHmtAR56RK6X/bouncefromsurface.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vRWi3e17RGqoovml3KFyI17nNpH2ucmBbGUxZ-YAr23N9AS6Z1oqCbZs*6qpd9KjZafN2W6TlKcpoD9iGDEtOHmtAR56RK6X/bouncefromsurface.jpg)\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMatt\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1242633", "name": "bounce-from-surface.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1242634", "name": "bounce-from-surface-test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Matthew Fielding", "created_at": "March 14, 2015 at 3:08pm", "created_by": "MatthewFielding", "topic": "''Bounce From Surface'' not discarding blocked sun rays", "id": "topic_1242635"}
