{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI have noticed that as I use HB and LB they gradually eat my RAM and never free the memory even after an operation is completed. This causes my computer to eventually crash.\n\n\n\nIs there a way to free the memory or other tricks to prevent crashing. (Other than adding extra RAM because it is a company computer).\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Daniel Mak", "created_at": "March 31, 2015 at 10:54pm", "created_by": "DanielMak", "topic": "HB and LB crashing", "id": "topic_1253949"}
