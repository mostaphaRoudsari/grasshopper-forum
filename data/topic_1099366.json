See here:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/103](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/103)\n\nAfter trying for a while and seeing this I'm wondering if this isn't possible yet. I'd like to use the schedule created from a daysim simulation for a subsequent E+ simulation within HB. I think I'm just failing to understand how to link all of the objects together.
