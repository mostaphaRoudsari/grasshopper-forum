{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha,\n\nI can make HDR but cannot make the false color HDR in the same file; besides, the false color works in other files. \u00a0Could you help me to check that?\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, one geometry I tried seems like it creates the HDR, but the image is totally white. I am not sure if the cause is from geometry, and if there any limitation to test the geometry in glare analysis.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nHui Ling\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1149671", "name": "1015_TEST_SHAD_Inno_GLARE_ques.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1149672", "name": "1015 Test_3 models_ques.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1149673", "name": "1015_IMG glare_ques.gh"}], "created_by_name": "HUI-LING CHANG", "created_at": "October 15, 2014 at 9:19pm", "created_by": "HUILINGCHANG", "topic": "Cannot get false color HDR image", "id": "topic_1149674"}
