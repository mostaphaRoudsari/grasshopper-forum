If you are interested in conducting validation studies of some sort, a more accurate resource will be using real-time data collected by a weather station close to you(direct-normal radiation and diffuse-horizontal radiation for daylighting).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "November 14, 2016 at 10:39AM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1638737", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1639252"}
