{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nIf you want to map the results for all the points at once, then you need to flatten the mesh list and join them together.\n\n\n\nIf you are looking to check the surfaces one by one then you can use the select branch component. I did both inside the file.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: There was also a minor mistake when you were trying to move the meshes forward. Mesh normal component generate the normal for every single face (3 in your case) which you only want to select one of them. You were generating 18 meshes instead of 6 and that's why the component was giving you the error.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1014085", "name": "HB__SVC_ForOlga_A2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 23, 2014 at 2:11pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1013989", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1014083"}
