{"body": "\nHello\u00a0Francesco, thanks for the comments and sorry for taking a while to answer.\n\nIf I understand you correctly, you want to have the option to set different parameters to different facades. What is not clear for me is guaranteeing a certain amount of sun hours as the logic for the component. The way the component is working now, sun access is guaranteed to all facades given the specified sun vectors.\n\nWe're working on an improvement to also take into consideration the angle of the sun relative to the facade, I think that could be relevant to the example you showed \u00a0-\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/JbqKOpRm*YJL0mwLJAui1Kt-t*vrZN3-tdCjp6EI4AZTrmjSZgWafcrQqz0rvo5ly0X3XgnBudiAN65w546tZL5AZYy*5cRj/relavent_suns10.jpg?width=721\" width=\"386\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/JbqKOpRm*YJL0mwLJAui1Kt-t*vrZN3-tdCjp6EI4AZTrmjSZgWafcrQqz0rvo5ly0X3XgnBudiAN65w546tZL5AZYy*5cRj/relavent_suns10.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother approach would be to run the solar envelope component with different parameters (for instance different sun vectors) and then combine all the envelopes to one. In this example I've added a component which does that -\u00a0[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=boris-p&amp;fork=hyd...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=boris-p&amp;fork=hydra&amp;id=LadyBug_Combine_solarEnvelopes)\n\nI've combined only two envelopes but it should work with as many envelopes as you want, the HighestEnv parameter is a boolean, if true will give the combination of the highest points and if false the combination of the lowest points for all the envelopes.\n\nLet me know if these improvements are helpful, or if something isn't clear.\n\n\n\nboris\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Boris Plotnikov", "created_at": "November 21, 2015 at 02:25PM", "created_by": "BorisPlotnikov", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1405859", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1406197"}
