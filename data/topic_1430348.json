{"body": "\nHi all,\u00a0\n\nI'm trying to model various types of shading surfaces infront of a glazed facade, making use of the EP context surface component in Honeybee. However, it seems as though when the shading surface has a irregular boundary (?), that the EP simulation engine is not able to read the geometry from the EP Context Surfaces correctly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn the attached file (see red groups in th .gh file), there are 2 hypothetical shading surfaces, both planar. Shading geometry 1 is part of what I want to model and shading geomtery 2 is just a random shape to compare the ouputs. Geometry 2 works but Geometry 1 doesn't, and gives an \"severe error\" due to non-planar shading surfaces. Is there a limit as to how many surfaces the HBContext_ input in EP simulation can handle? Or is there any other known explanation for the EP engine reading a planar surface as non-planar?\n\n\n\nKind regards,\u00a0\n\nAmanda\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1430347", "name": "20160104_IndoorComfort_Baked_Point0_simplified.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Amanda O'Donnell", "created_at": "January 4, 2016 at 10:54am", "created_by": "AmandaODonnell", "topic": "Honeybee EP context shading surface -", "id": "topic_1430348"}
