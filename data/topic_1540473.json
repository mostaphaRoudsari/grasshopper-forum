{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI am working on a Ladybug sheet calculating the solar radiation received at a specific location at every hour and day of the year.\n\n\n\nSo I have a list of a few thousands values of radiations, that I calculated from the sun's positions throughout the year using \"SunPositions\" of \"SunPath\". I can also get the dates and times corresponding thanks to \"SunPositionsInfo\" of \"SunPath\" component.\n\n\n\nNow I want to sum, for every day, the radiations received bu the surface in order to calculate the total daily radiation.\n\n\n\nMy problem is that I don't know how to detect and inquire change of date, and then how to sum values of each day to obtain a list of 365 daily values. The Ladybug sheet explaining my issue is attached.\n\n\n\nCan anyone help me with that ? :)\n\n\n\nThanks !\n\n\n\nYoan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1540472", "name": "20160602_DailySolarRadiation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Yoan", "created_at": "June 2, 2016 at 2:04am", "created_by": "Yoan", "topic": "How to calculate solar radiation during an entire day ?", "id": "topic_1540473"}
