{"body": "\nthank you very much, Mostapha!\n\n\n\nusing a simpler geometry in the attached file, it seems the Decompose By Type component can accept a list of thermal zone as input and it works fine.\n\n\n\nI assume it is geometry I was using in the last file that is causing the problem. But I don't know why and how to correct it.\n\n\n\nHope you can kindly advise by trying the file I attached.\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/M3nfRcI1YBlskXKxne8Jj4b2MrIP7r3Kjy2zt6zK8F1jG5d*l*lxocstJHzKYJs-B6Yc76r9QjfbQ5ddyftVHT5z8VKjp9Ez/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/M3nfRcI1YBlskXKxne8Jj4b2MrIP7r3Kjy2zt6zK8F1jG5d*l*lxocstJHzKYJs-B6Yc76r9QjfbQ5ddyftVHT5z8VKjp9Ez/Capture.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1439311", "name": "typology_v011 - Copy2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "January 15, 2016 at 3:05am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1439043", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1438909"}
