After changing the name of the space, it worked.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I can now export to openstudio. But it won't load correctly in sketchup when I tried to open the exported .osm. Well, it does load, but it's only wireframes... I tried running the openstudio diagnostic on it, without success.\n\nHas anyone experienced that before?\n\n\n\nI've attached the gh file with internalized data if someone would be extremely kind to take a look at it... (please don't mention how bad the names I gave are... I'm aware :) ), as well as the exported .osm.\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\nJulien\n\n\n\nPS: don't be surprised if it takes some time to process... The solve adjacencies module takes about 2min to complete on my laptop)\n\n\n\nSide note: I've never managed to make the Grizzlybear work for gbXML export... but that can wait until I try it on a simple shoe box...\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1249457", "name": "2015-03-24_Mall.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1249458", "name": "mall.osm"}], "created_by_name": "Julien Marrec", "created_at": "March 24, 2015 at 1:39pm", "created_by": "JulienMarrec", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1249347", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1249456"}
