{"body": "\nNow i get it,\n\nJust checked this. There is an input _skyDensity, which is supposed to be 0 or 1 (For Tregenza sky patch subdivision, or 1 for Reinhart's). Default is supposed to be 0.\n\nIn anycase your isue is related to this resolution value. I was thinkung that the possible values are 0 or 1, but now i see that the default is 3. If you make this bigger, say 5, you'll see that it looks smoother ... taking more time to compute.\n\nSo, the question (another one) for Mostapha is what this value is supposed to be, or better, if the values are 0 or 1 only and there is a bug right now.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 1, 2014 at 12:29pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1140984", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1141158"}
