{"body": "\nI have now had some time to look at the new components. I think they work well for your example, but they can't really be applied to my case. I was interested in making a spacial visualization of the local discomfort in a room, just like you can do the your PMV comfort tool. I don't think it makes much sense to split up the geometry for each testpoint(or row of points). This is my example room. There is 104 points. Splitting the zone in 10 slices (number of rows) seems silly. And what if I wanted to investigate a different surface or change the point grid? Then I would have to remake the geometry and make new slices. \u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3D9Q6Zd9hf*W7IeEJh2sjDH-vzPpi7HY0FaUaE8kMJe3q37h5t86v1XZ5IDDPJYwQwMXoqd9tOCPEBwocMEYJuGb51LvLRwO/Udklip.PNG\" width=\"474\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3D9Q6Zd9hf*W7IeEJh2sjDH-vzPpi7HY0FaUaE8kMJe3q37h5t86v1XZ5IDDPJYwQwMXoqd9tOCPEBwocMEYJuGb51LvLRwO/Udklip.PNG)My initial thought was to do the geometry splitting in the view factor (VF) calculation, that way you just have to run the view factor component again if you want to investigate another surface. In my head the component took the inputs: Testpoints, HBzone and Testsurface. The component would then for each point return two lists. One containing the VFs to the surfaces between the testpoint and testsurface (including the VF to the testsurface of course). The other one contain the VF to the remaining surfaces of the room.\n\nI hope it makes sense.\n\n/Christian\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Kongsgaard", "created_at": "April 17, 2016 at 7:26am", "created_by": "ChristianKongsgaard", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1510189", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1510414"}
