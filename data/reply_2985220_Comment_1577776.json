{"body": "\nChris, thanks for the note. I'm still trying different \u00a0things and preparing the batch files before I start working on the server. I'll definitely\u00a0keep you updated.\u00a0\n\nJust a quick question, Are the batch file created right after the DOS window appear\u00a0ok to use? in another word are the contents of the batch files created in the beginning of simulations stay the same after simulations are done?. I'm planning to close the pop-up dos windows as soon as they appear and I'm not sure if the batch files being written are valid to run later.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "August 7, 2016 at 11:00am", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1577548", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1577776"}
