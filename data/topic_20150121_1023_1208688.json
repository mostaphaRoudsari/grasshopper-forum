{"body": "\nHi all, i'm tryng to calculate PET value with Ladybug about outdoor thermal comfort study.\u00a0\n\nI am using for my thesis from which revenue Envimet some benchmarks including MRT and then through Rayman get the PET PMV SET index values. Unfortunately I can not (sorry I'm still in the early experiences with LB + HB) to calculate the PET with LB (maybe checking the result with that obtained by Rayman), my goal (idea) would be to write a component (or cluster) that allows me to determine the PET through the input of values as (potential temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, MRT)and\u00a0view all within my 3D model.\n\nThank you in advance.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Luciano", "created_at": "January 21, 2015 at 10:23AM", "created_by": "Ambrosinus", "topic": "Is it possible to calculate PET value to evaluate Outdoor thermal comfort condition?", "id": "topic_1208688"}
