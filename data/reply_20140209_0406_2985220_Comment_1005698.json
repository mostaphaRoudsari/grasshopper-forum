{"body": "\nThanks Chris,\n\nI appreciate your comments. It is so nice that there are thoughtful minds behind the tools. I mean the three of you.\n\nIf i may, i believe your \"proposal\" of a TrimToSiteBoundary will be nice. The default can be set to False, so users get the solar geometry, as you want. But this is your call. Either way, i can tell you that both versions are an excellent contribution. Hope Saeran will agree to set the 4 dates for his version. Once he does, :-), i will update the Compare file and upload it, so everyone can have and understand the differences.\n\nThanks again to all of you,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 09, 2014 at 04:06AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1005629", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1005698"}
