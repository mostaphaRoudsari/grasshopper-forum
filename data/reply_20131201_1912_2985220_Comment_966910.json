{"body": "\nHi Doompop,\n\nDo you have any example of results of the VSC calculation that you can share with me. I wrote a component for Honeybee to calculate VSC based on this discussion ([http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-Sept...](http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/004017.html)). The results makes sense to me but still I would like to double check the results with some examples before the first release.\n\nThanks,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 01, 2013 at 07:12PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_812184", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_966910"}
