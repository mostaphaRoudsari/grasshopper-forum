{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n<br/>I am trying to simulate a model of dual axis solar tracking shading device (integrated with PV) **to calculate the amount of electricity produced from the PV also the shading performance of the tracking shading devices**. The idea is illustrated in the attached figure. I have used OpenStudio SketchUp Plugin to model the building and simulate the energy performance of the building using OpenStudio software, but now I need to model and simulate this tracking system, is it possible to perform this in honeybee? This is not a static system as you know and it should be responding to the Sun's movement during the simulation runtime period.\n\nThank you in advance\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hardi Barznji", "created_at": "September 6, 2017 at 8:08am", "created_by": "HardiBarznji", "topic": "Two-axis PV tracking system simulation (electricity production+shading performance)", "id": "topic_1809647"}
