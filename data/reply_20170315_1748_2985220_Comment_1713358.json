{"body": "\nI see. Hm. I guess I am confused because I expected the sky to look a bit more symmetric. For example..\n\nHere is the sky produced by my original .epw file:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/lHx7t9jngWcEFUMBQk8xXUhrMD2BM1qvkldZUwSZ0rQRUC-pHd6Qo996SVgMLMtz4bG-EKVVxEI*OypiehR8Ad3mAsKEi2gF/original_sky.PNG\" width=\"574\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/lHx7t9jngWcEFUMBQk8xXUhrMD2BM1qvkldZUwSZ0rQRUC-pHd6Qo996SVgMLMtz4bG-EKVVxEI*OypiehR8Ad3mAsKEi2gF/original_sky.PNG)\n\n\n\nLooks nice!\n\nBut after changing the direct radiation values I get this for the same 24 hour analysis period:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/lHx7t9jngWevrCM7X1ntF4Wx-hYOshjGFviNxbSbZNl1RNCqI0Hrd9KsljtO70MlEIv20fLyQnP7b6dCtJ2GK0G3yQh-me8G/new_sky.PNG\" width=\"561\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/lHx7t9jngWevrCM7X1ntF4Wx-hYOshjGFviNxbSbZNl1RNCqI0Hrd9KsljtO70MlEIv20fLyQnP7b6dCtJ2GK0G3yQh-me8G/new_sky.PNG)\n\n\n\nAs Chris pointed out, it seems to be missing half of the day. I double checked the direct radiation output numbers and your component is doing what it is supposed to from what I see.\n\nHere is another view of the sky from the edited epw file:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/lHx7t9jngWeqAeS1YZ9q3ThQToytqYd-B8meGHwSDfp2-f4ZM4PjtxKUb5u8clkgh8*z*yk6sXQ5QMOY3re4*Up3oitCbbJS/new_sky2.PNG\" width=\"493\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/lHx7t9jngWeqAeS1YZ9q3ThQToytqYd-B8meGHwSDfp2-f4ZM4PjtxKUb5u8clkgh8*z*yk6sXQ5QMOY3re4*Up3oitCbbJS/new_sky2.PNG)\n\n\n\nAgain, I expected a sky that more resembled the one produced by the original .epw file - just different values.\n\nMaybe the raw data I supplied is not correctly formated - or the time step is off. The direct radiation replacement data was given by hour starting from the hour after midnight.\n\n\n\nAny idea, Sarith?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mike Johnson", "created_at": "March 15, 2017 at 05:48PM", "created_by": "MikeJohnson", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1713255", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1713358"}
