{"body": "Mostapha,\n\nOh man. I must have had a total lapse of memory. I can't believe that I am just realizing now that the reason why callFromHBHive takes so long is that it makes a copy of the zone. I have written 20 different ways of getting around this time consuming and yet I somehow never questioned why it was so time consuming.\nI'm glad that you chimed in here or else I might have taken a long time to write this thing. I guess the only thing we need to do for this capability is change the name and HBID of the zone before adding the transformed zone back to the hive, right?\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 14, 2015 at 04:50PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1360962", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1361604"}
