{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThis was not my question, but thanks.\n\nIf you see the original file from Ugur he selected one specific day for the selectSkyMtx. If you use this same date for the RealTimeAnalysis it is fine. But what about changing this date?\n\nSo my general question is: If you want to get truthful results for the RealTimeAnalysis should you set the analysis period for the selectSkyMtx the whole year? providing you want to change the date in the RTA.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 21, 2013 at 6:48am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_961518", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_961409"}
