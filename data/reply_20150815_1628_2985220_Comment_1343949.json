{"body": "\nGuus,\n\nYou did not internalize the geometry in your GH file and you did not include a Rhino file with the correct referenced geometry (the dxf is not what GH references). \u00a0As such, I cannot run your file to see how you are using the components. \u00a0You also did not include any E+ run in your GH file and so I do not know what you are simulating for comparison.\n\nGiven the temporal discrepancy of the results, I would guess that you are not running the two with the same context geometry (or you did not use the same north vector for your E+ run and Ladybug study or something like that).\n\nI will also say that the Ladybug Radiation Study is meant for outdoor cases without intricate geometry as the calculation does not account for bounces of light (it is just meant to be a quick simulation to help inform early stages of design about orientation and exterior shading). \u00a0If you need a high accuracy simulation of radiation that includes bounces of light, you should use the honeybee daylight components. \u00a0This example file will get you started:\u00a0[https://app.box.com/s/ssag6914u9z8sk1ik1b4qmy20m97ae0n](https://app.box.com/s/ssag6914u9z8sk1ik1b4qmy20m97ae0n)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 15, 2015 at 04:28PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1339713", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1343949"}
