{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nIt was a very weird bug. \u00a0I was getting a \"can't divide by zero\" error and yet I already had a check in the function to make sure that it didn't divide by zero. \u00a0In any case, I put in yet another check and it fixed it in the attached file. \u00a0Thanks for finding the bug.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/nLML9an*avpLNyOfayC6cZuSbN1XlyCnpiqCv37DpaWFA1atiOkgbhwKBVPecPPPojSEYjt1pn3e32xmQUmNJoVQm1SoRb3w/FileWorking.PNG\" width=\"585\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nLML9an*avpLNyOfayC6cZuSbN1XlyCnpiqCv37DpaWFA1atiOkgbhwKBVPecPPPojSEYjt1pn3e32xmQUmNJoVQm1SoRb3w/FileWorking.PNG)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1220951", "name": "IndoorComfort_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 9, 2015 at 12:00am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1220943", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1220949"}
