{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\nGrid-based recipes are a good way to go.\n\n1. To be honest, I am not completely certain of the best way to divide up the direct and the diffuse radiation. \u00a0Normally, in the condition of a clear sky, you can use this formula to relate diffuse and direct radiation:\n\nDiffRad = 0.17 * (DirRad) * (sin(Solar Altitude))\n\n(formula taken from\u00a0[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/89m1h2dg#page-6](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/89m1h2dg#page-6))\n\nBecause the radiation is coming from two sources in your case (the sky and the building), this situation is a bit more complex. \u00a0I imagine that the overall intensity of radiation is going to matter more than the specific portion of direct and diffuse. \u00a0So I would try a case with 75% direct and 25% diffuse and a case with 15% diffuse and 25% direct, accepting that the range between the two as a possible error.\n\n\n\nThe starting MRT that the Outdoor solar temperature adjustor asks for is just what it says it is in the description. \u00a0It is the expected MRT in the case that there is no sunlight falling on the person. \u00a0In your case, you might start with an assumption that the MRT is close to that of the air at the given hour you are looking at. \u00a0You can get a more refined sense of this MRT without radiation by looking at outdoor surface temperature results from an energyPlus simulation.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 6, 2015 at 7:58am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1234485", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1237865"}
