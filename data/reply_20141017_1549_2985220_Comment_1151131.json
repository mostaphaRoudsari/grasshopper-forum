{"body": "\nHi Orn,\n\nIt seems like you are getting the issue because the component is overwriting the results if you set \"RunRAD\" to False but \"WriteRAD\" is still set to True. \u00a0One thing that might help with this if you have both\u00a0\"WriteRAD\" and \"RunRAD\" connected to the same boolean toggle, which will ensure that you do not overwrite your results again until you are ready to run the next daylight simulation. \u00a0Another thing that might help is if you set the \"overwriteResults\" input of the daylighting component to False. \u00a0This will ensure that any daylight simulation that you have run is never overwritten. \u00a0I have done this in the attached file and let me know if this solves your issue.\n\nThe simplest way that I have found is to write the name of a parameter that you are testing into the RAD file name of the simulation and this should ensure that each file has its own name and does not over-write previous results (it looks like you are doing this with the glazing ratio, though, so maybe I do not understand).\n\nI think that the \"RunItAll\" component is not included because it is not as relevant to the specialties of LB+HB and it seems that Brute Force does the job of this component a bit more nicely.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 17, 2014 at 03:49PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1150084", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151131"}
