{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you! It's running with energy plus 8.3.0 but when I am trying to read the result files, I used item selector to separate the files and connected it to read EP results but it showed the following errors.\u00a0\n\n1. Your simulation probably did not run correctly. <br/>Check the report out of the Run Simulation component to see what severe or fatal errors happened in the simulation. <br/>If there are no severe or fatal errors, the issue could just be that there is .eio file adjacent to the .csv _resultFileAddress. <br/>Check the folder of the file address you are plugging into this component and make sure that there is both a .csv and .eio file in the folder.\n\n\n\nBut my .csv file and .eio file is there, I will send a clean file tomorrow to show the issue.\n\n\n\nVinu\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "October 30, 2015 at 07:45PM", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1389854", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1390026"}
