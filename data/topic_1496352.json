{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI try to simulate the influence of switchable (EC) glazing on the energy budget.\n\nThe shading (EC) should be controlled by illuminance on workplane, glare or/and temperature in office.\n\nI've done illuminance and glare based simulations in DIVA for Rhino, but in DIVA the control options are limited.\n\n\n\nSince I'm a beginner in HB, I could use some help.\n\nLet's say we have 3 shading states (+ base state)\n\n\n\n1. When running an Annual Daylight Simulation like this (Glare)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/m-rUv2ZKei79y690DsBHPVzEHasvVa4if6dWflfWDYO6Kt7QIDSlBJhYHVCf9aCWZm9eDWg6Way11vhZ3L0leZvOJYOgGxr2/ok1.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/m-rUv2ZKei79y690DsBHPVzEHasvVa4if6dWflfWDYO6Kt7QIDSlBJhYHVCf9aCWZm9eDWg6Way11vhZ3L0leZvOJYOgGxr2/ok1.PNG)Is the shading controlled on DGP(0.4) or on radiance(W/m\u00b2)?\n\nThe DGP values in the result file/data are all below 0.4.\n\nThere is no schedule file, whence I know when and which shading state is active? Can I generate such a schedule from the Data in HB and use it later in the energy simulation?\n\n\n\n2. How to properly build this kind of control strategy in GH/HB?\n\n\n\n3. Is it possible to control the ECs by temperatur?\n\n\n\nGreetings and thanks in advance,\n\nJakob\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jakob Schmidt", "created_at": "March 30, 2016 at 3:40am", "created_by": "JakobSchmidt", "topic": "Electrochromic Glazing in Energy Simulation", "id": "topic_1496352"}
