{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI've been delving deeply into the code and I am posting my thoughts here in the hope of making things clearer.\n\n\n\nWhat should be entered into the 3 inputs is the transmittance of the glass, however radiance actually needs the transmisivity in order to account for the internal reflections of the glass. There is a formula for this shown on page 7 of the radiance primer.\n\n\n\n[http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/radiance-primer.pdf](http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/radiance-primer.pdf)\n\n\n\nMostapha has embedded this formula \u00a0into the code so that for the radGlassMaterial component transmisivity\u00a0is automatically written to radiance/daysim.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/mRIiJdI0bcyLCTlDrYa88rmE*HYxEIXsTr4IyfJd4R5fiEAFOYNxhEBLrM6v8H*azz0MOIDGdsSlyjSQh5QcMN2N8sv0m-Py/transmittivityincode.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/mRIiJdI0bcyLCTlDrYa88rmE*HYxEIXsTr4IyfJd4R5fiEAFOYNxhEBLrM6v8H*azz0MOIDGdsSlyjSQh5QcMN2N8sv0m-Py/transmittivityincode.PNG)\n\n\n\nFurthermore transmisivity\u00a0works for both daylighting and solar radiation studies where the input transmittance is visible transmission for daylighting and SHGC for the latter.\n\n\n\nHowever what I am not entirely clear about is what is the purpose of theavrgTrans output where \u00a0theavrgTrans\u00a0= 0.265 * RedTransmittance + 0.670 * GreenTransmittance + 0.065 * BlueTransmittance. Mostapha I understand that this the photometric \"visible transmittance\" so why is it not used for daylighting simulations?\n\n\n\nLet me know if I've got anything incorrect here,\n\n\n\nAnton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "May 11, 2016 at 10:54AM", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1527015", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1528148"}
