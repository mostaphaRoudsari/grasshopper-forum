{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nHappy 2016!\n\n\n\nI was wondering if (if not yet covered in another topic and I missed it) it would be possible to add the inputs on the HB_GlzBasedOnRatio component that will assign the newly generated windows _EPConstruction and/or _RADMaterial properties. It would speed up the process of reconstructing HBZones especially in projects with many glazing surfaces!\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "January 04, 2016 at 02:43AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "topic": "HB_GlazingBasedOnRatio Component", "id": "topic_1430061"}
