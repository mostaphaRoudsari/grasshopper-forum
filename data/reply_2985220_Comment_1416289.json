{"body": "\nHi Dmitry, Based on the line number either gendaymtx.exe is not downloaded on your machine correctly or the analysis hasn't run correctly on your machine. To address the issue first check c:\\ladybug and make sure gendaymtx.exe is downloaded correctly. It should be 21KB. Then make sure it's unblocked (right click, properties) and if both of them are fine re-run the analysis and set\u00a0useOldRes_ to False. There are couple of similar discussions if you search for gendaymtx\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 7, 2015 at 7:20am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416421", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416289"}
