{"body": "\nHi Matthew\n\n\n\nGlad you joined the community. I'm not quite sure that I understand your problem but from the image I assume that you want to isolate only the bounces from the source surf. If this is the case, I did something similar on a skylight project. See the explation bellow and attached file. Hope it helps.\n\n\n\ncheers\n\n\n\nclaudio\n\n\n\nFind the intersection of the sunrays and source surf (this will return the pas on surf that receives sunrays)\n\nFind the discontinuity of the sun rays (this returns all the sunrays bounces)\n\n-FIRST ISLOATION- Isolate the\u00a0second (1) and third (2) items from the discontinuity component (last and second to last sunray bounce)\n\n-SECOND ISOLATION- Isolate the second item of the -FIRST ISOLATION- (this returns the last bounce of the sunrays)\n\nFind a target srf that your are interested in evaluating.\n\nCreate a Beep with the target geometry (it needs to be a solid geometry)\n\nFind if the pas of the SECOND ISOLATION are inside the target Brep\n\nDispatch the points of the previous action into true (they are inside) false (they are outside)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1242809", "name": "bouncefromsurfacetest_CN.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "March 15, 2015 at 01:18PM", "created_by": "Claudio", "parent_id": "topic_1242635", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1242807"}
