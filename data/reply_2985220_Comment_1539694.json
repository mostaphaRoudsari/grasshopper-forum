{"body": "\nI'm not sure how to be any clearer...\n\n\n\nWhat is the best way to get a solar fan for a specific analysis period for a min number of hours, for example 21 June 9am-3pm where each part of the surface receives at least 2hrs?\n\nThe 'Solar fan basic' component allows required hours (2 hrs), but only a monthly range (so I can't specify 21 June). Whereas, the 'solar fan' component I can specify the sun vectors for a specific analysis period (21 June) but not the min required hours.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul Wintour", "created_at": "June 1, 2016 at 12:03am", "created_by": "PaulWintour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1539918", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1539694"}
