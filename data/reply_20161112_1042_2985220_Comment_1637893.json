{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nI just tried running it without any geometry for openings. It works.\n\n\n\nThis is a sample I ran. My original geometry is a bit complex than this one. I tried the same thing with the original geometry, not keeping the openings without any geometry. However, Honeybee_Run Daylight Simulation component threw me an error saying \"It has to be a closed BREP.\" Therefore, I tried AIRWALL. I like your second suggestion too. That's a good one.\n\n\n\nThanks a lot,\n\nDevang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "November 12, 2016 at 10:42AM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1638115", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1637893"}
