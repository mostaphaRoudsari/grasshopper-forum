{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,<br/><br/>I'm doing a final project degree about a portable work space, and want to choose the final shape of the roof from radiation analysis. My roof works upon the selection of a gantry which has three ranging points Y and X.\n\n<br/>What I thought would play a radiation analysis on the object and then make an analysis of the results from each roof format using the Galapagos.\n\n<br/>So, Galapagos recognize every chance roof shape and make a link with the outcome of radiation study and would like the result, the format that allows me to take over the roof to the use of solar panels.\n\n<br/>I discovered LadyBug few days ago and am trying to understand it as quickly as possible, because I have only a few months to finish my work.<br/><br/>Have you any idea how I can do it efficiently?<br/>I have started to do some tests using the examples files, but do not know how to link with the Galapagos.<br/><br/>Congratulations for your work and thank you very much for your help\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1307247", "name": "HUB_lady bug - radiance.gh"}], "created_by_name": "rebeca duque estrada", "created_at": "June 10, 2015 at 5:51pm", "created_by": "rebecaduqueestrada", "topic": "How to use LadyBug_Radiation and Galapagos for a roof study", "id": "topic_1307248"}
