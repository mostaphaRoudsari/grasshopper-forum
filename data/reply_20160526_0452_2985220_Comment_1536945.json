{"body": "\nHi Masoome,\n\n\n\nI think you might be able to do it if you can generate IDF for your model and edit it in idf editor. You can input both the reflectance values under WindowMaterial: Glazing. You can again bring the modified idf in to honey bee for results visualization and further analysis. Hope this helps.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest luck,\n\nR.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ram Joshi", "created_at": "May 26, 2016 at 04:52AM", "created_by": "RamJoshi", "parent_id": "topic_1528595", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1536945"}
