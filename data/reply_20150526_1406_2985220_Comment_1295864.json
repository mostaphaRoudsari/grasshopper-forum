{"body": "\nAbraham and Theodore,\n\nThanks so much for posting this. \u00a0That warning about overlapping edges and the corresponding closed air volume output was something that I put in really recently to help me debug certain complex geometry cases so it is great to see that you are finding cases where it is relevant.\n\nThe distFromFloorOrSrf error that you were getting with a panel input was a bug. \u00a0I have just fixed it in the attached file.\n\nI tried re-projecting the window geometry onto the wall surface and this seemed to fix everything related to the glazing.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/d5hxC5etmnmMDJhwez0u4sa1qyyfwPhsH13Duy7JIQ*Pg2wiiR3atY-hjxZYkWnarIe7g4ftd4Mp6TXD4zZLjloXAyvAVZuf/ComfortMapWorking.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/d5hxC5etmnmMDJhwez0u4sa1qyyfwPhsH13Duy7JIQ*Pg2wiiR3atY-hjxZYkWnarIe7g4ftd4Mp6TXD4zZLjloXAyvAVZuf/ComfortMapWorking.JPG)\n\nUnfortunately, the geometric freedom of Rhino can sometimes make it easy to have surfaces that appear to be in the same plane but differ by small barely-noticeable amounts. \u00a0Re-creating the geometry should usually fix these cases.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1295866", "name": "AngelHouse_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 26, 2015 at 02:06PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1291379", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1295864"}
