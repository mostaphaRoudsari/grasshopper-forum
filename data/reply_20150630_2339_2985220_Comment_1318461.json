All the components get changed yesterday and the automatic update can't deal with them.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1318462", "name": "02postlsimulationKAITsimulationBUp_AY3_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 30, 2015 at 11:39PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1318529", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1318461"}
