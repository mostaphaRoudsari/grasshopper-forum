{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and all,\n\nSimilarly, in some cases, we may need to use multiple customized Occupancy Schedules for different users together with\u00a0multiple corresponding\u00a0Occupancy Activity Schedules in the energy simulation, due to the complexity of the usage pattern.\n\nFor instance, we assume a sports hall (with a grandstand) which will be used for training (without spectators) for 6 days per week; and for competitions (with a large number of spectators) for 1 day per week. In this case, we may need two\u00a0Occupancy Schedules and two corresponding\u00a0Occupancy Activity Schedules\u00a0for the players and\u00a0spectators respectively.\n\nTherefore, it is important to allow us to connect multiple\u00a0customized Occupancy Schedules and\u00a0multiple\u00a0Occupancy Activity Schedules\u00a0to the \"setEPZoneSchedules\" component at the same time; and it is also important for us to input data as a \"list\"\u00a0into the \"setEPZoneLoads\"\u00a0component, each value (i.e. load) in the input \"list\" corresponds to a different customized Schedule.\n\n**Is it possible to do that in HB? and what is the correct way?**\n\nThank you!\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "March 12, 2016 at 7:00am", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "topic_1482490", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1482858"}
