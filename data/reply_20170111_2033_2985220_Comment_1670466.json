{"body": "\nCharlene,\n\nThis is an interesting issue here. \u00a0Taking a look at the IES file, the fixture has an absolute luminosity of\u00a02909, lumens, which is about the equivalent of two 100-W incandescent light bubs. \u00a0I would say that your results seem to reflect that and it may be worth positioning the fixture closer to the ground, which is what I would do if \u00a0had only two light bulbs.\n\nAlso, from a quick search, these sun tubes don't seem to bring in that much light (juding very anecdotally here from the few images):\n\n[http://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-product-design/sunportal-pipe...](http://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-product-design/sunportal-pipes-sunlight-where-sun-dont-shine.html)\n\nIt seems that a lot might be getting lost in the light bounces through the tube.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 11, 2017 at 08:33PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1670547", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1670466"}
