{"body": "\nHi Jose!\n\nSorry for the slow reply! Fortunately Abraham and Berk already answered the questions. Here is my 2 cents:\n\n1. In your definition you don't need to connect the test geometry to the context. The component does consider the test geometry as the context as a default.\n\n2. As you can read in radiation analysis component description the result for indoor studies won't be accurate. I assume in your case you can run the studies on the building envelope instead of the floors and optimize the geometry?\n\n3. Really interesting topic for a thesis. I wonder if you have already read Nathaniel Jones' thesis. It has a really good introduction to optimization and Genetic Algorithms:\u00a0[http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~nlj5/thesis.html](http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~nlj5/thesis.html)\n\nI wish I had the Honeybee developed enough to share it with you for your studies. A project like this is the right fit for using Honeybee.\n\nHope it helps!\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 10, 2013 at 10:34PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_847505", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_850390"}
