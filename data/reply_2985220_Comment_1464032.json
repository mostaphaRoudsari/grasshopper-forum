{"body": "\nDear Sarith,\n\n\n\nThanks for the quick reply!\n\nMy study know is about the comparison of a Radiance based simulation (in this case using Honeybee, not radiance desktop) and a test room lit by daylight. So basically I won't need any annual daylight simulation, rather a simple illuminance map taken at the floor plan. The I will compare the real with the simulated ones.\n\nIn the beginning the variables I am taking into account do not include any shading devices, like for example the typical metallic white venetian blind, that I have been told, and later on read, are the actual problem of the Radiance engine.\n\n\n\nSo, do you think that if I do not simulate this kind of blinds (with curve surfaces and high reflective material), I can have good result in the simulation?\n\nThanks again for the helpful reply\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Federico", "created_at": "February 15, 2016 at 11:16pm", "created_by": "Federico587", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1464027", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1464032"}
