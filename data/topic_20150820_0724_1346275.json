{"body": "\nHello,<br/><br/>Firstly, I would like to thank all the developers for the great plugins!<br/><br/>I am trying to import a simple gbXML file generated by the GrizzlyBear into the DesignBuilder, however it keeps asking for the missing U-values (image) even though for the window material, Uvalue is defined inside the XML (image).<br/><br/>Maybe anybody knows what can be the reasons for that?\n\n\n\nMoreover, I am trying to export a geometry comprising an AIR WALL partition, and I would like DesignBuilder to recognize it as virtual partition (or hole), for both horizontal and vertical surfaces.\n\nDo you know why is this happening and how to solve it?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance!!\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bGawF3RRkae7UA4E9DAGx0grbYvUna9Gy3YC8Cq8RUWTxpAuNWSrEx8XzSz*pmKv5JHhpG8*rmaORQ-IZnROVS2n66XQofh1/Capture.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bGawF3RRkae7UA4E9DAGx0grbYvUna9Gy3YC8Cq8RUWTxpAuNWSrEx8XzSz*pmKv5JHhpG8*rmaORQ-IZnROVS2n66XQofh1/Capture.PNG)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bGawF3RRkafdzSF*dcQGHSo5L-6ML5j3PxmR094rdgQHTjEGHomOkKkNrFBIOVwgMyVhsg7RtSIokJU1g6DAduxs25yKe-6*/Capture2.PNG\" width=\"675\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bGawF3RRkafdzSF*dcQGHSo5L-6ML5j3PxmR094rdgQHTjEGHomOkKkNrFBIOVwgMyVhsg7RtSIokJU1g6DAduxs25yKe-6*/Capture2.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1346273", "name": "gbxml_export.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1346274", "name": "testXML_tas.xml"}], "created_by_name": "Antonio D'Aquilio", "created_at": "August 20, 2015 at 07:24AM", "created_by": "AntonioDAquilio", "topic": "Design Builder cannot import gbXML generated by GrizzlyBear", "id": "topic_1346275"}
