{"body": "\nOk thanks Abraham it makes sense, I did not know that. I tried to add the EP material as you said, I did not find the equivalent of the \"setRADMaterials\" for EPMaterials though. The closest I could find is the \"setEPZoneCnstr\" that you can see in red in the screenshot attached. The problem is that it seems that this component doesn't work, I tryed to put other components with the same input and output and it works with them, but apparently my\u00a0\"setEPZoneCnstr\" doesn't work even if I toggle true the honeybee update component, it will anyway stay red as it is in the picture and say that the HBzone is not defined..\n\nWhat do you guys think is the problem? Is there a way to redownload that particular component? Or is there a better one I could use for this purpose?\u00a0\n\nI attached also the .gh file that I am working on and the Rhino model, so that you can may be try yourself on your laptop, just to understand, if there is a problem with that component in this version of honeybee, or if it is just a problem on my laptop.\n\n\n\nValerio\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1658332", "name": "Screenshot 2016-12-15 13.04.35.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1658333", "name": "SAMPLE MODEL microclimate exe.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1658334", "name": "SAMPLE MODEL_MATERIALS_15_12_microclimate exe.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Valerio Soldera", "created_at": "December 15, 2016 at 05:38AM", "created_by": "ValerioSoldera", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1657504", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1658331"}
