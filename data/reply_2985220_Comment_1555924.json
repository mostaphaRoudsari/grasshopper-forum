{"body": "\nAryan,\n\nSorry for the late reply. \u00a0It's been a busy month. \u00a0Your answers:\n\n1 - Just duplicating the zones with the 'Move' component should work (no need to duplicate surfaces). \u00a0Keep in mind that this is a WIP component and there may still be bugs in it. \u00a0Copying the zone geometry first and then creating the zones may be a safer option.\n\n2 - YES! \u00a0Honeybee can handle the curved surfaces as you can see but you will cut down your simulation time 100-fold by planarizing your geometry in an intelligent manner.\n\n3 - If you were only building a single test box model, making the interior and exterior two separate zones would probably be the most accurate and would allow you to asses many different surface temperatures and heat flows. \u00a0However, if you are trying to model a full building like this, you are better off simplifying the whole facade down into a single construction or else you can end up with really long calculation times.\n\n4 - If I were you, I would only simulate one floor at most. \u00a0In this case, you want to make the boundary condition of the ceiling and floors adiabatic. \u00a0The simplest way to do this is to pass the zones through the \"Make Aidabatic by Type\" component and check the boundary conditions with the \"Decompose Based on Boundary Condition\" component.\n\n5 - You are mostly correct except that direct sunlight turns to diffuse light after passing through the SECOND WINDOW that it hits (not the first and not a pane of glass but a full window). \u00a0This allows you to accurately model things like double skin facades as separate zones. \u00a0\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 26, 2016 at 5:44pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1542767", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1555924"}
