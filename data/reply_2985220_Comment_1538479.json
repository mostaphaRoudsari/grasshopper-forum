{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, thanks for your answer.\n\nBelow you will find the file you requested. You will see two consecutive HB_solveadj; I just want to understand the methodology for using correctly this component: whenever I make relevant changes in zone properties, especially when they are in contact each other, I should use this component another time before running simulations, shouldn't I?\n\nBy surface barycenter I mean the point of reference on the surface for which single results are related to: indeed I suppose, similarly to grid points of daylighting studies that are the points of reference of the tiles in which the grid analysis is subdivided, the outputs provided by\u00a0HB_generateEPoutput\u00a0(surfacetempanalysis/surfaceenergyanalysis) have a similar way of showing us the results.\n\nI have changed the way of exporting the results after reading release notes where you explained the new features of \"bake it\"\n\nWhere can I find Rhino's progress bar? Can I recall it from rhino command bar? I have found this on the internet\u00a0[http://discourse.mcneel.com/t/sample-code-showing-a-progress-bar-du...](http://discourse.mcneel.com/t/sample-code-showing-a-progress-bar-during-rhino-command/17190). Currently I am not able to create codes.\n\nI have internalized the breps as you requested for the image-based dayligthing studies\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nLuca\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1538481", "name": "gettingstarted_mackeytutorial_12to23.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1538482", "name": "basic_daylight_analysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "lukanuts", "created_at": "May 29, 2016 at 1:24pm", "created_by": "lukanuts", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535654", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1538479"}
