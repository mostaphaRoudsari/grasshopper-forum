{"body": "\nHello grasshopper Forum\u00a0<br/><br/>The first message, was a little bit thin in its information about the problem and i apologize for that. It had been a long day and night, which lead to a frustrated and short message. Anyhow I really like your opinion upon the problem.\u00a0<br/><br/>I have tried for someday to simulate an outdoor wind flow of my own rhino model (Importet from sketchup). Beforehand i went through a tutorial of\u00a0[Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0holrRypJilkFo-Dv4JsQ), and everything worked during that tutorial with a provided grasshopper example file for this situation of an outdoor simulation.<br/><br/>Then I tried to simulate upon my own, and got everything to work just fine until the Solution component from Butterfly. Suddenly my Rhino model disappeared and I wasn't able to see if it was working. Still the Solution component was still running, but without any visible content in Rhino.<br/><br/>What could have gone wrong?\u00a0<br/><br/>Kind Regards<br/>Christoffer\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoffer Thor Paulsen", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 10:59am", "created_by": "ChristofferThorPaulsen", "parent_id": "topic_1748841", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749187"}
