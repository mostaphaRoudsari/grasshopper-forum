{"body": "\nI have a coloured mesh showing analysis results on a grid on building surfaces. I would like to visualise this mesh, if possible with transparency, overlapped on a 3D textured model of the city, like in Google Earth.\n\nEach cell of the mesh would have a different colour, like the attached one. I tried with GHowl or Ladybug_KMZ Generator but nothing is displayed in Google Earth.
