{"body": "\nHi Pable,Yesterday's image was from directory C. That's why i was wondering.\n\nnow i run your file as is. Just disconnected the workingDirectory. It works fine without any change. It makes me thing that you are missing some of the required software, even you think you have the most updated versions.\n\nThere are some threads in the forum addressing issues like yours. I'm lazy to search, but as i remember Mostapha's answer was related, in effect, to non updated software versions.\n\nCan you run the\u00a0Essai_glz_04_verreLV_04_RADInit.bat file and see what the CMD window says? Looks suspicious to me that you don't have the octree file (oct).\n\nAttached the results directory i'm getting, so you can compare and check.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1366171", "name": "Essai_glz_04_verreLV_04.zip"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "September 22, 2015 at 4:42am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1366162", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1366170"}
