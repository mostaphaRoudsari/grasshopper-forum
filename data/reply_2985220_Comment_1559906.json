{"body": "\nHi Chris,<br/><br/>With all due respect, I am actually surprised that you have been confused by these two simple steps:\n\n3) Extract the downloaded .zip file content anywhere. Then copy the content from its \"bin\" folder to the \"c:\\ladybug\\terrain shading mask libraries 64-bit\" folder.<br/>\u00a0<br/>4) Copy the content from its \"bin\\gdal\\csharp\" folder to the same \"c:\\ladybug\\terrain shading mask libraries 64-bit\" folder.<br/>That's it!\n\n<br/>Nevertheless, I have just introduced an article with installation photos to the [newest version of the component](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/userObjects/Ladybug_Terrain%20Shading%20Mask.ghuser).<br/><br/>To answer the second part of your question:\n\nThis would mean that the developer of the GDAL libraries would have to come up with a separate .zip file used by Terrain_Shading_Mask component only, for both x86 and x64 versions of Rhino5. He is not willing to do that.<br/>Not hosting the libraries on developers website (gisinternals.com) but rather on ladybug github account or separate server may raise an issue with licensing, for which I do not wish to be accounted for.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 4, 2016 at 4:44pm", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559891", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559906"}
