{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\nThe Read EP Result component has been failing for me whenever my output files include a central HVAC system. At least in my most recent file, the Fan Electric Energy and Pump Electric Energy columns in the CSV file are causing issues. I think part of it is that my column names don't include the strings the code searches for (e.g. 'FAN CONSTANT VOLUME'), but even when I change the column name to include those, I still get an error from the\u00a0checkCentralSys() function that's being called in the code. I'm just commenting out those sections for now, but any ideas on how to fix it?\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'm attaching an example file you can test with. Thanks,\n\n\n\nJulia\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1591115", "name": "v9_HVAC.csv"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1591116", "name": "v9_HVAC.eio"}], "created_by_name": "Julia S", "created_at": "August 30, 2016 at 08:45AM", "created_by": "JuliaS", "topic": "Having trouble with Honeybee_Read EP Result", "id": "topic_1591117"}
