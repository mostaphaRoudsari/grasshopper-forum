{"body": "\nHi Thomas,\n\nwell annual simulation won't be necessary if i can run the test at least at the extreme periods of the year (Summer and Winter solstice) to reduce the\u00a0complexity\u00a0of the analysis as you said march june sep and dec.\n\n\n\nmy project is to determine the optimum opening size on each elevation\u00a0separately\u00a0 (north, south, east and\u00a0west) that can provide best daylight around the year.\n\n\n\nwhat i did as following: modeled a parametric opening window with number sliders to control the window size on each elevation, and each window has 5 to 9 different dimensions\u00a0( Sizes in terms of H and W), then i want to run a simulation for each elevation to define the best window size that can provide\u00a0maximum value of 500 lux average as an office space by\u00a0examining\u00a0the opening size against lux value each hour of the day from\u00a08:00am to 6:00pm using galapagos. but the problem is when i used\u00a0galapagos to run the simulation i couldn't find a way to get average window size of the 10 hours but instead i have to run the simulation each hour of the day which will result in 10 different windows instead of having a single window size that can provide me a decent daylight value during the whole day.<br/>\n\n\n\ni don't know if there is anyway around ?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ataur Rahman", "created_at": "March 14, 2016 at 11:32AM", "created_by": "AtaurRahman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1483342", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1484325"}
