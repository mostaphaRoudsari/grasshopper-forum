{"body": "\nAlejandro,\n\nGlad to be of help.\n\nI know that the intersectMasses component worked with what you had but I should have clarified to say that you were lucky in your case and the component did not change your geometry much. \u00a0Most of the time, you want to make sure that you zone geometry is good before turning it into a zone.\n\nYou are right that, when you have air walls, you definitely do not want an adiabatic condition but, even when you have interior partitions between zones, I have often gotten a substantial amount of heat flow across them (particularly when one zone has a higher internal or solar gain than another). \u00a0This heat flow, more often than not, drops down the need to take the heat away through the cooling system. \u00a0I would just recommend that you do a comparison of the thermal loads of your building with and without adiabatic conditions to understand how much this can affect the simulation. \u00a0I know that the adiabatic is faster and, if the results prove to be very close to each other, then it might be ok to continue with the adiabatic assumption.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 7, 2014 at 8:49pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183087", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183207"}
