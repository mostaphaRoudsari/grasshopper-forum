{"body": "\nHi everyone!\n\nFirst off I'd like to thank Mostapha, Chris and all the developers of this awesome software.\n\n\n\nI made a model to perform an optimization for the detailed design phase. The model is a university building with 81 thermal zones. I wanted to use this model on my master thesis, but I am afraid I won't be able. So I would really appreciate some help.\n\nThe purpose was to set different insulation thicknesses and glazing types depending on the orientation. Therefore I created every zone by using \"createHBsrfs\" components. At the same time different zones would have different \"building programs\".\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/nkQiLxDRFQV5M3xFB0juutdy37IngJn8DPhVfEoz-L8kmG5BbJnPZ6sgNSRsnZggbu*CSj6PA4NMw-ahIk*uT8HzIWbEvGsv/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nkQiLxDRFQV5M3xFB0juutdy37IngJn8DPhVfEoz-L8kmG5BbJnPZ6sgNSRsnZggbu*CSj6PA4NMw-ahIk*uT8HzIWbEvGsv/Capture.JPG)\n\n\n\nI created all the zones, I added windows as \"child surfaces\" for every zone. And I created the adjacencies. No errors or whatsoever.\n\nBut from this point I cannot connect the model to any other component without GH being frozen. So although the model is correct maybe it is to heavy for the software, however I am not sure if that is the reason.\u00a0\n\nIs it stupid what I have done? Is there any easier way to accomplish my purpose?\u00a0\n\nAny thought or help will be much appreciated.\n\nI attach the GH file.\n\nThank you,\n\nEduard\n\nVersion: HB 0.0.59 / LB 0.0.62\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1539422", "name": "University model.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Eduard Nunez", "created_at": "May 30, 2016 at 04:22PM", "created_by": "EduardNunez", "topic": "Model too large/complex to be used in HB?", "id": "topic_1539423"}
