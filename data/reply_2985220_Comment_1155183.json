{"body": "\nChris,\n\nThank you so much! that did the trick!\n\nWere did you get your gendaymtx.exe?? If you look closely yours is 19 kb, and mine is 21 kb.\n\nI downloaded mine from the location in the python component, it links you to a dropbox location ([here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16228160/GenCumulativeSky/gendaymtx.exe)), but that one generates the strange results... I don't know if I'm the only one, maybe you could try to replicate by temporarly replacing your 19kb one with the 21kb and see if that also happens to you?\n\nAnyway thanks again!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Arie-Willem de Jongh", "created_at": "October 24, 2014 at 3:52pm", "created_by": "aw", "parent_id": "topic_1154737", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1155183"}
