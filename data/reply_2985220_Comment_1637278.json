{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, <br/><br/>I am facing the same type of issue with a recursive voxel aggregation. Within a loop of Anemone I use honeybee to test recursive geometries. with the 40 000 points, and therefore voxels to be tested, my memory runs out quick and rhino crashes.<br/><br/>I have attached the gh file.\n\n\n\nSo far I have been trying to pause the loop save the gh file, close rhino and reopen and start the loop again. However as soon as the ram is busy, pausing the loop is not possible.<br/><br/>Is there a way to clear the cache at each iteration or a way around this?<br/><br/>Olivier\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Olivier Dambron", "created_at": "November 11, 2016 at 3:52am", "created_by": "OlivierDambron", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1633670", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1637278"}
