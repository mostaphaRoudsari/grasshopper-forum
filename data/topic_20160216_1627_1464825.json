{"body": "\nHi all, I am a new user of Ladybug and Honeybee, still watching all the tutorials and I encountered a problem.\u00a0I was trying to get this script with a simple box geometry working based on Mostapha's tutorial on youtube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqbCkjMYxdk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqbCkjMYxdk)).<br/>The example file worked fine after I updated it, but I tried to re-do the script by myself and run the gridbased simulation for illuminance and it gives me a fatal error message\u00a0(as seen on the image, also for DF simulation):\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/w1RO3fq7oDY0k-a3SrSsoxwZXoUM7L-EDKwkn0YaNK2Pb4v5z867lv-Z7kBV2w9R4jssOikr7Vpd9iiKIq0AXhUM30SYLwgp/truncatedoctree.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/w1RO3fq7oDY0k-a3SrSsoxwZXoUM7L-EDKwkn0YaNK2Pb4v5z867lv-Z7kBV2w9R4jssOikr7Vpd9iiKIq0AXhUM30SYLwgp/truncatedoctree.png)\n\nFailed to read the results!<br/>rtrace: fatal - (WWR_.5_TVis_.6_RAD.oct): truncated octree\n\n\n\nRuntime error (PythonException): Failed to read the results!<br/><br/>\n\nTraceback:<br/> line 336, in script\n\n\u00a0\n\nI checked everything again and it still gives me the same error. I uploaded 2 of my script files (one where both illuminance + DF simulation did not work and another one where DF simulation could work). I am using the latest LB+HB version and Copenhagen as my weather file.<br/>Can someone tell me what is wrong and help me to solve this issue?\n\nThanks before![<br/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/w1RO3fq7oDY0k-a3SrSsoxwZXoUM7L-EDKwkn0YaNK2Pb4v5z867lv-Z7kBV2w9R4jssOikr7Vpd9iiKIq0AXhUM30SYLwgp/truncatedoctree.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1464822", "name": "gridbased_fatalerror.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1464823", "name": "GridBased_DFworks.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1464824", "name": "truncated octree.png"}], "created_by_name": "Stephanie Jenny Angeraini", "created_at": "February 16, 2016 at 04:27PM", "created_by": "StephanieJennyAngeraini", "topic": "Daylight Gridbased Simulation Error (rtrace: fatal - truncated octree)", "id": "topic_1464825"}
