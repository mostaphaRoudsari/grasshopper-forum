{"body": "Grasshope and Abraham,\n\nI apologize for the late response here. I just finished teaching a workshop on LB with Mostapha and I have a lot to catch up on here. I know that this error is related to the fact that I recently switched the Run Simulation component to use the design days in the ddy file instead of the previous sizing, which was done based on extreme periods in the EPW. Using the ddy file is better practice than sizing based on extreme EPW periods but I did not test out the new workflow for all ddy files. It seems that some formats of ddy files may cause this error. I am travelling now but I will gix this issue as soon as I get back in ~14 hours. In the meantime, I would strongly recommend using the OpenStudio component instead of the run simulation component. The OpenStudio component currently has all of the features of the run simulation component and, over the next few months, we will begin phasing out the run simulation component to focus all development on OpenStudio. The reason is that OpenStudio allows us to model the HVAC, which is now fully-functional in the OpenStudio component.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 23, 2016 at 12:48AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570239", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570324"}
