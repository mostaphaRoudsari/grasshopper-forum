{"body": "\nXinyi Wu,\n\n\n\nThis is an issue with the way that I coded these components to recognize the various different types of energy/flux values (Wh, kWh, Wh/m2, or kWh/m2).\n\n\n\nBecause the units that you were plugging in were all lower-case, the component was not recognizing that you were trying to convert values of flux (kWh/m2) instead of just energy (kWh).\n\n\n\nI just wrote in a more robust means of identifying your units so it should now work in your case (see components attached and on the github).\n\n\n\nThanks for pointing this out,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1380856", "name": "FixedConverterComponents.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 17, 2015 at 11:28AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1380233", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1380854"}
