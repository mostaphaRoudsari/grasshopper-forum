{"body": "\nHi Vasken, Thanks -\n\n\n\nMy understanding from your notes is that the simulation always works but converting .hdr images to .gif or generating falsecolor image fails. I assume that it is only happening for image-based analysis?\n\n\n\nMy best guess is I messed up something when I applied parallel run for image-based analysis. I wonder if one of the pieces of the image is problematic and makes the whole process fail. Here is another case that Alexander reported recently ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/photo/shadow-study-with-radiance](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/photo/shadow-study-with-radiance)).\n\n\n\nCan you send me .hdr file which fails in the process of generating falsecolor image? I can look into it then. Should be an easy fix.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 25, 2014 at 02:11AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1136049", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1136907"}
