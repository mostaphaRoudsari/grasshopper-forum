{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for the help. Being a novice I realized that a complex definition would mess things up (i.e. I would) so I just did the simplest one I could. Perhaps that was the issue.\n\n\n\nAlso, the geometry has curved surfaces. I know energy plus doesn't handle those well but I thought the through honeybee they are approximated. At least I thought that happening for glazing. Might be the issue?\n\n\n\nAs for the parallel issue yes I've seen the discussions. I believe there was research concerning the uncertainty and error in calculations from different idf files. It has something to do with how energy plus warms up I guess.\n\n\n\nWhat if we used overlapping days (e.g. 4 days) on the split idfs? I believe that would lessen the error. Also, of course for my final energy simulation I would just run it for 1 day to get accurate results but for conceptual stage, and very large models, it would be nice to have the speed buff (if possible).\n\n\n\nI'll take a look on the mailing list when I get time. Thanks!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 13, 2015 at 4:00am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223849", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1224015"}
