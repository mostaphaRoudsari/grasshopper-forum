{"body": "\nhello everybody!, I am quite sensitive to the topic as I would like to use more VSC in honeybee or ladybug as I am still using ecotect to calculate VSC because I \"trust\" results more.\n\nMaybe this \u00a0could be of some help.\n\nVSC is graphically calculated using the waldram diagram that divide the sky in showed in the image below.\n\nI am quite sure that the 1-2% difference comes from calculating the portions of the sky in a different way so maybe this diagram might help you to \u00a0identify the right proportions to calculate vsc!\n\nThanks !\n\nAmedeo\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4uCoQpo4b7pyWW-fIXikFXwEXos6gmJND5yuOmIhJ4LZuGQO9mb8NHwyFvU55nrvvK-BH*JxOaJPsZgTZy5cMWEw71wYMVJ/Picture1.png\" width=\"402\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4uCoQpo4b7pyWW-fIXikFXwEXos6gmJND5yuOmIhJ4LZuGQO9mb8NHwyFvU55nrvvK-BH*JxOaJPsZgTZy5cMWEw71wYMVJ/Picture1.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "amedeo scofone", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 10:31am", "created_by": "amedeoscofone", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1434773", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448290"}
