{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nSome additional points:\n\nThere is a direct relation between two View factors from two surfaces.\n\nF1-2.A1=F2-1.A2\n\nI think when one is using shadingmask or similar tool, it means that F1-2 is calculated from point to surfaces or sky then for F2-1 or SVF it needs to use the above equation.\n\nSVF=F2-1=(A1/A2).F2-1\u00a0\n\n- Other way to calculate SVF geometrically like NV method is to calculate\n\nsum(2*Sin(Altitude))/n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 which \"n\" is number of rays.\n\n- Always be consider that the hotter surface radiant to the colder (Fh-c) so Sky temperature is one of the most important variable if you are calculating atmospheric long wave radiation or infrared. Furthermore, be careful about infrared bounces!!\u00a0\n\nNavid\n\n\n\nfor more information for View factor:\n\n[http://www.thermalradiation.net/tablecon.html#C5](http://www.thermalradiation.net/tablecon.html#C5)\n\nshort youtube video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIfRBB49MC4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIfRBB49MC4)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "navid", "created_at": "February 17, 2016 at 10:27pm", "created_by": "navidhatefnia", "parent_id": "topic_1459770", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1465678"}
