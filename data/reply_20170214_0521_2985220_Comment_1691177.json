{"body": "\nI believe that the customized opaque material will replicate a grass on every aspect but the evapotranspiration. As I understood you were more concern about radiant temperatures and not about comfort I considered it as a good option.\n\n\n\nIn the case that you are more interested on the comfort, hence on the evapotranspiration effect, you may find easier just to put in the \"_soilTypeOrMat\" of the ground zone the option 2 (Moits soil). This may simplify your workflow. However, if you are more interested on a comparison of different types of grass this wont work (as you had the default green roof material I didn't think that was your case, but no idea)\n\n\n\nI have to confess that I tried to introduce the material on \"HB Surfaces\" and then plug it to the ground zone with the option 2 that I mentioned, but I didn't work for me in the first attempt. Maybe doing something similar to that you have an option\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julia T", "created_at": "February 14, 2017 at 05:21AM", "created_by": "JuliaT", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1691337", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1691177"}
