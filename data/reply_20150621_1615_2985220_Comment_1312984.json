{"body": "\nThis is a warning that usually happens if you have a non-convex shape and center point falls outside of geometry. In general if the normal direction is already set correctly then you shouldn't be worried about it. In the image all the shapes look like simple boxes so you shouldn't normally see the warning. I will check your file and report back.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 21, 2015 at 04:15PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1310579", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1312984"}
