{"body": "\nHi Artem,\n\n\n\nNot sure this is what you want but I'm pretty sure you can create and .idf in Honeybee and then import it to energy plus, edit or add every advanced option you want, and run it. Also, if you are comfortable with the E+ objects, you can add additional strings in the Honeybee energy simulation component directly.\n\n\n\nAnother thing you can try is the OpenStudio workflow, within Honeybee, that allows to quickly setup detailed simulations (although it is still in development).\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 18, 2015 at 7:53pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1289305", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1289722"}
