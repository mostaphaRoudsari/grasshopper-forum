{"body": "\nI agree that we need to address this issue however I suggest a different approach. User may have created several transforms to the original geometry which will be very hard to track. Also what would you do for several copies of the same object with the same HBID?\n\nI think we need to create a number of components for moveHoneybeeObjects, rotateHoneybeeObjects, and scaleHonebeeObjects.
