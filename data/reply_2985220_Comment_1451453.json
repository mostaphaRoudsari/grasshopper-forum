{"body": "\nHi Ludvig,\n\nThank you for explaining the issue very well. The error has nothing to do with the libraries. It can't find the id of the Honeybee surfaces from the sticky. Can you check your file and see if all the surfaces that you're connecting to the component are Honeybee surfaces and there is no None or Just Grasshopper geometry connected to it? We should have a better protection for cases like this.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 31, 2016 at 5:44pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1450871", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1451453"}
