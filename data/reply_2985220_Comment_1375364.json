{"body": "\nHi Robert,\n\nThere is plenty of material to start from, if i understood your question/request.\n\nI suggest all those wonderful video tutorials that Mostapha prepared for Daylight analysis using HB: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkjfDmSc5OryXkWSt57ltJFU4qXD...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkjfDmSc5OryXkWSt57ltJFU4qXD5ss1v)\n\nThere are also excellent videos that Chris prepared for E+ simulations, but they can also be used for Daylighting purposes. See: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8Y...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_)\n\nBasically the answer to your question is YES. You can use rhino models/GH generated geometry and use them for the simulation purposes. But i don't want you to get this answer as absolute. There are many considerations that according to them you want to use HB definitions, that in many cases make your life more comfortable. There are other cases where you do want to define your own model and input it on HB. So each case has its own constraints.\n\nHope it helps a bit.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 8, 2015 at 7:40am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1375193", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1375364"}
