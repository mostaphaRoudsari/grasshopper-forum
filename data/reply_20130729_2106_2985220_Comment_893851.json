{"body": "\nHi Ehsan,\n\nI'm not sure if I fully understand what are you exactly looking for in your study. Do you want to run radiation analysis for each hour of the year for a dynamic shading? If that is the case then you need to animate a slider for each hour of the year and export the result to an external file. You should be able to read the result back for visualization.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 29, 2013 at 09:06PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_893060", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_893851"}
