{"body": "\nI forgot to internalize it\n\nyou have assigned a Brep\u00a0inside the grasshopper. I get this error when I use rhino based surfaces\u00a0or volumes. even in your file if you bake the Brep\u00a0and assign it again you get this error too. However, this is a good point to build my form in grasshopper instead of rhino, at least I can do my analysis in this way.\n\n\n\nThanks alot\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Farzane Oghazian", "created_at": "February 10, 2017 at 1:04am", "created_by": "farzaneo", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1688740", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1688750"}
