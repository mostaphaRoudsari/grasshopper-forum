{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI am running an energy simulation with honeybee to show indoor microclimate map. The simulation works fine but the honeybee adaptive comfort analysis receipt component keeps show this error message below\u00a0\n\n\n\n1. For one of the meshes in the _viewFactorMesh, the number of faces in the mesh and test points in the _testPtViewFactor do not match.<br/>This can sometimes happen when you have geometry created with one Rhino model tolerance and you generate a mesh off of it with a different tolerance.<br/>Try changing your Rhino model tolerance and seeing if it works.\n\n\n\nThanks for the help\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bLx5PI5eKB3fdt-jcvyFYVxkfSNlK6Qc*DPoZ3XrGF02uGPrMuhr5izIQir05w*nx4ZtWtOaBh7CKFYyCVIyhirhBrc*e7KK/Cattura.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bLx5PI5eKB3fdt-jcvyFYVxkfSNlK6Qc*DPoZ3XrGF02uGPrMuhr5izIQir05w*nx4ZtWtOaBh7CKFYyCVIyhirhBrc*e7KK/Cattura.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1517937", "name": "FINAL_MICROCLIMATE.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Niccolo", "created_at": "April 27, 2016 at 1:56pm", "created_by": "Niccolo844", "topic": "Honeybee Adaptive Comfort Analysis Receipt Bug", "id": "topic_1517938"}
