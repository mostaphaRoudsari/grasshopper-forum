{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nThank you so much for your help, I thought I have the most updated components, because I remember downloading them from github, it turned out I'm wrong. I had the same issue before and Chris Macky pointed out that it's caused by using a mix of old and new components.\n\n\n\nI fixed few other things and uploaded it again, I'm still unable to get the cooling loads to work, any ideas?\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1245260", "name": "Final.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1245261", "name": "New_Glazing_sys_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "March 18, 2015 at 10:11pm", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1245051", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1245259"}
