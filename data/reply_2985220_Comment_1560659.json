{"body": "\nThis is a very old discussion but since a number of people have asked we eventually have a prototype that's ready for testing. It's pretty unstable in terms of running iterative studies but works fine for setting up the model and meshing. If you're an experienced OpenFOAM user who is willing to test the components please get in touch. If you haven't used OpenFOAM before then wait a couple of more weeks until we have it stable and ready to use by public.
