{"body": "\nHello, I am Dimitrios. I'm a student in architecture trying to model this as a fine mesh expanded metal panel that gives the outer skin a very different appearance depending on the light situation. Very similar to this building. It looks like what you have modeled I was wondering if you would be able to share any insight in modeling what you have made? If you could share the model as well that would be great too. Thank you for your help.\n\n<img alt=\"poolima | Glass Kramer L\u00f6bbert - MRT Geb\u00e4ude, Berlin Buch: \" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/62/77/4d/62774dd1ed5929571951729e753ad9b3.jpg\"/>\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Zoulis", "created_at": "March 01, 2017 at 02:54PM", "created_by": "DimitriosZoulis", "parent_id": "topic_1364623", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1703293"}
