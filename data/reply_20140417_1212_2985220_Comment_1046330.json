{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThanks for this examples. Presenting results in an understandable fashion is truly important.\n\nI'll ask your help in the attached. I used your file and just changed the mesh and the results. Option 2 is giving me trouble. I think i know where but don't know why: In the DeconstructMesh component, just after LB_RecolorMesh, the input BaseMesh is 49 (7x7 grids), but the output MeshFaces is the square of it (2041). And this is making trouble. In your example both data are the same.\n\n\n\nAdditionally i'm adding another visualization option, taken from your first workshop. Feel free to improve it.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1046332", "name": "LB_HB_3DResultsVisualization_A.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 17, 2014 at 12:12PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1045033", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1046330"}
