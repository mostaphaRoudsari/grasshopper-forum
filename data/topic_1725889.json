{"body": "\nI am trying to model a self-shaded freeform facade using Ladybug. The resulted mesh that I obtain from the 'shade' output from 'shadowRange' component looks incorrect or opposite. The meshes which should be sun-exposed are 'sun-shaded' in my model. Attached is the file. Need help to fix it. I would appreciate if somewone explain me the logic/algorithm to locate the 'self-shaded' meshes. Thanks.
