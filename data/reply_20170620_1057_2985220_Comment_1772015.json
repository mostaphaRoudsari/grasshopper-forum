{"body": "Hi Kit,\n\nI know that those temperatures seem crazy based on what we experience in our daily lives but they are actually perfectly reasonable given what you have put into the model. It would be unusual to build an unconditioned, south facing, highly-insulated shallow room without any way to open the windows (unless you are trying to build a solar oven :). As long as you use the \"SetEPAirflow\" component that I see is being bypassed in your GH file, your simulation will allow for operable windows and you should get temperatures that seem much more familiar.\n\nI hope that helps,\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 20, 2017 at 10:57AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1771479", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1772015"}
