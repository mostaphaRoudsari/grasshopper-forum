{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nI feel like I am discovering the weirdest bugs. \u00a0You are right that the error only happens when you do an annual run in parallel. \u00a0The non-parallel function runs fine and, if I run the analysis for just a month in parallel, it works fine. \u00a0Moreover, I noticed that the parallel function is failing on a different hour each time that I run the component.\n\n\n\nI'm going to keep working through this but I can't figure out what is going on. \u00a0Maybe Mostapha can shed some light on this.\n\n\n\nTo address the issue of the vertical surface disappearing, the latest version of GH has a major bug in the display of meshes. \u00a0Any time that there is a brep previewing in the Rhino scene, meshes will be shown with only one side of their face colored. \u00a0From the other side, they appear invisible. \u00a0If you rotate your model 180, you will see that the vertical mesh is still there. \u00a0Also, if you turn the preview off on the colored charts, you will see both sides of the mesh colored again.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 9, 2015 at 1:51pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1221122", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1221337"}
