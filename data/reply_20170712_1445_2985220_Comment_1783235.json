{"body": "\nErik,\n\n\n\nYour proposed method seems a bit complicated and I think there are some simpler/better ways of modeling it. \u00a0If the labyrinth really is a \"room\" as you say, you could model it as a separate high mass zone but I would use a custom air mixing object to push air from this zone into your other zones (defined by whatever schedule you are using). \u00a0See this discussion for an example of how to add custom mixing objects with addiditionalStrings:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interzone-a...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interzone-airflow-rate-for-a-large-volume)\n\n\n\nIf your Rock Store is more tube like or \"Labyrinth-like,\" I would use the \"Honeybee_AddEarthtube\" component to model your thermal labrynth. \u00a0The most recent version of Ladybug + Honeybee on the github has this Earthtube component working for both the \"Export to OpenStudio\" and the \"Run energy Simulation\" components. \u00a0This Earth Tube method is what I would recommend for the vast majority of thermal labrynths.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 12, 2017 at 02:45PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1782797", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1783235"}
