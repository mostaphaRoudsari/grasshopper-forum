{"body": "\nThe night boundary layer height default of 80m in the code is the right one, not 800m.\u00a0I'm not exactly sure why the reference height and boundary layer height are interacting that way to produce your error, but resetting the height to &lt;100m should fix things.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe height of the night boundary reflects the diurnal pattern of the urban boundary layer (image below). During the day the solar shortwave radiation heats up the urban surface, mixes with the air above creating a tall boundary layer. During the night the surface cools down, the boundary layer becomes more stable, and it's height is reduced. So typical heights for daytime is ~ 1000m, and for nightime ~ &gt;100m.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bVLdSV9mW3dka4wyuo1pLoGkjrlhZ8cV6NBwdiEWzoItLVjRu8AFRDTRdSpGuxUiVzf11KDKBMrAFCG5jdwm86KqH*Uvx--C/2.JPG?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bVLdSV9mW3dka4wyuo1pLoGkjrlhZ8cV6NBwdiEWzoItLVjRu8AFRDTRdSpGuxUiVzf11KDKBMrAFCG5jdwm86KqH*Uvx--C/2.JPG)\n\n\n\nSo increasing it by a factor of 8 to 10 is likely what is causing issues with the UWG calculation for you. I started a github issue here:\u00a0[https://github.com/chriswmackey/Dragonfly/issues/11](https://github.com/chriswmackey/Dragonfly/issues/11) so that we can fix this typo. Also we should figure out why exactly the calculation is failing so that can potentially put an upper bound to the inputs or a better error message. Thanks for catching it!\n\n\n\nFinding some reference data linking weather layers to urban typologies is a good question, I'd like to find some too. Perhaps Chris/Mostapha might be able to provide some? You can check out the following thesis [1],[2] that the UWG algorithm is based on, which references three case studies for Singapore (Punggol), Capitoul and Bubble:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bVLdSV9mW3cdM0nu5GRqtnertGk79rkqCnDPx0vAZTi5zMwcScnG8PwiuRf7hFQwjBnPo1k2Y8zbrAeDKoZX29RIWDDv*vHQ/1.JPG?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bVLdSV9mW3cdM0nu5GRqtnertGk79rkqCnDPx0vAZTi5zMwcScnG8PwiuRf7hFQwjBnPo1k2Y8zbrAeDKoZX29RIWDDv*vHQ/1.JPG)\n\n<br/>[1]\u00a0[https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/107347](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/107347)\n\n[2]\u00a0[https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/59107](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/59107)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "September 13, 2017 at 02:20AM", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "parent_id": "topic_1812960", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1812968"}
