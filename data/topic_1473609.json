{"body": "\nDear Ladybug+Honeybee team,\n\nThanks for latest update!\n\n\n\nI realized that in last two updates the coloring scheme for the\u00a0Sunlight Hours analysis has changed to gray-scale.\u00a0\n\nMe and my colleagues in the office preferred the old coloring scheme (blue to red) for Sunlight Hours analysis. The new gray-scale one is not as intuitive to read, even though I understand that you could associate the darker shades to more shadow.\u00a0Is there a way to change to the old one, or set to user-defined coloring schemes?\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nKay\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kayrokh Moattar", "created_at": "February 29, 2016 at 3:40am", "created_by": "KayrokhMoattar", "topic": "Coloring scheme for Sunlight Hours analysis in new updats", "id": "topic_1473609"}
