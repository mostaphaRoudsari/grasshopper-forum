{"body": "\nHi Mehrnaz,\n\nI took a look at your model. I have following observations that I would suggest you look into.\n\n1. Your air wall surfaces are partly inside the zone and partly outside the zone. I would recommend you assign them EP construction as per exposure.\n\n2. Your surfaces for Roof and Floor overlap.\n\n3. Surface Type \"Roof\" is assigned to many floors\n\nI have not looked further than checking how you prepare your geometry. So the root of error may not be the way you have assigned surfaces. However, to follow a good modeling practice I would suggest you address these issues.\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "December 1, 2016 at 5:21am", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "topic_1649592", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1649857"}
