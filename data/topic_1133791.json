{"body": "\nHi,\u00a0\n\nI need some help with a script I am developing. I am using Ladybug to run a glare analysis to assess the percentage of the time that my building is creating glare in the surrounding buildings. I am using 'Ladybug_bounce from surface' and 'Ladybug sunpath' to simulate the sunrays. I want to create colored meshes over the facades of the surrounding building showing the percentage of the time that my building generates glare on them.\u00a0\n\nSo far, there are two things that I do not sure how to solve:\u00a0\n\n- How do I check when the rays hit the cells of the meshes? I tried 'Mesh inclusion' But even though the points are located within the cells of the mesh I only get 'False' in the output.\u00a0\n\n- If I use 'Ladybug_analysis period' I get all the rays simulated at the same time. However,\u00a0I want\u00a0half-hourly\u00a0simulations to be run one by one so in the end I can calculate for each cell of the meshes the percentage of the simulations when they were reached by a ray. How can I do this?\n\nI attach the file of the script.\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nAle\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1133789", "name": "Sample model.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1133790", "name": "Glare script 19sept.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "September 19, 2014 at 3:16am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Glare analysis", "id": "topic_1133791"}
