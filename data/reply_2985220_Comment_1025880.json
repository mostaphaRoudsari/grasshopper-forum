{"body": "\nWell...\n\nSince I manually (i.e. by means of a admin user) created c:\\ladybug earlier today (my second message), my user has all rights within that directory. Before downloading the\u00a0OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf from the link above, I saw that the directory contained a bunch of files already.\n\nSadly (:-) there was a complicating factor that I hadn't thought of: when I was doing those first steps, I was at work. The directory already contained the\u00a0OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf file but when opening that in notepad, I found out that this was a fake - it was in fact an html file that get generated by the system at work that blocks access to all kinds of websites (considered social networking). Replacing that file with the one I now downloaded from dropbox, fixes everything...\n\n\n\nOK, a quick test shows that there are other instances of root access, e.g. the 003_shadowanalysis file has the\u00a0c:\\shadowStudy path. But manually fixing these seems to work.\n\n\n\nCool!\n\nThanks a lot, Mostapha, for your hard work on these components! I'm sure going to have a good time (and a lot of learning) with all this.\n\ncheers,\n\nwim\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Wim R.M.
