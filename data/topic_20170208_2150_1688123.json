{"body": "\nHi Team!\u00a0\n\n\n\nQuick question, is there a way to change the units in Ladybug_Radiation Analysis to be Wh/m2 rather than kWh/m2? Just for presentation purposes since we are just showing one hour in January, and of course the solar radiation values for that one hour are in the 0-1000 W/m2 range.\n\n\n\nIt's a bit picky, but the client is interested for presentation to remove decimals. I had a look at trying to change it myself in the coding, but couldn't quite locate where the coding is for the results in order to just x them by 1000.\n\n\n\n- Thinking at this point I should really just learn python!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "February 08, 2017 at 09:50PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Changing units in Ladybug_Radiation Analysis", "id": "topic_1688123"}
