{"body": "\nI have worked around this before by scripting a schedule component into the User Library (UL) IDF: the component was of the schedule:file type. In the same GH script, \u00a0I:\n\n1) injected the e+ schedule:file component into the UL IDF\n\n2) used honeybee to call the schedule from the honeybee library (which includes whatever is in that UL IDF).\n\n3) called the\u00a0runOS HB component\n\n\n\nThe IDF that was generated (and run) by OpenStudio studio referred to my external CSV file (which was generated elsewhere). By George it worked.\n\nI haven't yet been successful with the standard HB CSV schedule functionality, even with the current version of the OS component (with the aforementioned OS/E+/IDF do si do...clever trick). Although I'm very possibly wrong, I think it didn't work because of the component type I was driving with the schedule (blinds).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Novelli", "created_at": "August 03, 2016 at 12:30PM", "created_by": "NickNovelli", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1576153", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1576057"}
