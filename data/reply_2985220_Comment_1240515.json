{"body": "\nHi again Chien,\n\nYes for the explanation of the underlying issue, it makes it clear.\n\nI\u00b4ve running some tests with the updated component and the simulations are running ok now :)\n\nYet a new hurdle I encountered is that the 'Read EP Result' cannot find the csv file with the results. I checked the file path and they don\u00b4t appear to be there as if the simulation hadn\u00b4t run.\n\nDo you have any thoughts on that?\n\nThanks,\n\nAlejandro\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/qmsUgHzH5lN6h6e4M9l-9mAEa3u9NLLSMYqrJjUZbiolQcT85ptz5XGT7YCxCWUWkAnvMz8w0T7vulnaauyQNEUYW6n6eaWf/LBHB01SkyRiseSetup2message.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/qmsUgHzH5lN6h6e4M9l-9mAEa3u9NLLSMYqrJjUZbiolQcT85ptz5XGT7YCxCWUWkAnvMz8w0T7vulnaauyQNEUYW6n6eaWf/LBHB01SkyRiseSetup2message.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1240516", "name": "LBHB-01-SystemsSetup2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Gamas", "created_at": "March 11, 2015 at 1:08am", "created_by": "AlejandroGamas", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1236682", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240515"}
