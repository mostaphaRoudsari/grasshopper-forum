{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nI forgot to mention here that you bug you reported was fixed a few days ago:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/229](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/229)\n\nAmadeo,\n\nThank you for posting your knowledge. \u00a0I am still a bit unclear on how the\u00a0waldram diagram divides up the sky of if it is different from a Tregenza division of the sky. \u00a0However, I can tell you that running the new Ladybug view analysis component with a high skyResolution is likely to give you a more trustworthy result than an ecotect study with a low sky resolution. \u00a0For a sanity check about how the calculation is being run in Ladybug, you can always connect up a vector display to the new 'viewVec' output of the component:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/y*uTehDOGQsFIkqcHfnpUOphJxFLbz4OpH25O77KEoVtqYXy*mE4JHt3DwtDtpLSPl2Rp2iz4*T6QjAfg-K75rU3*rgzMojV/ViewVectorDisplay.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/y*uTehDOGQsFIkqcHfnpUOphJxFLbz4OpH25O77KEoVtqYXy*mE4JHt3DwtDtpLSPl2Rp2iz4*T6QjAfg-K75rU3*rgzMojV/ViewVectorDisplay.JPG)\n\nBy changing the slider, you can understand how the accuracy of the simulation improves with higher resolutions.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1448481", "name": "viewVectorDisplay.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 03:57PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448290", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448480"}
