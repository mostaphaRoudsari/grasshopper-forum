{"body": "\nDaniel,\n\nSorry for the late reply.\u00a0 As Mostapha said, make sure that you are aware of all of the assumptions of the evaporative cooling model that you are using and that it is a close approximation of what you are proposing as a design.\u00a0 Before posting the question to unmethours, it might be worthwhile to read through the EnergyPlus Input/Output reference on evaporative cooling objects so that you are able to ask the right types of questions:\n\n[http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/pa...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/page-052.html#group-evaporative-coolers)\n\nOnce you have nailed down the evaporative cooling model that you want to use, you should be able to implement it with the additionalStrings input of the run simulation component.\u00a0 Here is an example for how to do this for an evaporative cooling downdraft tower like those in the ancient Iranian city of Yazd, where wet sheets were sometimes hung at the top of the towers to get cool air to sink into the houses:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Evaporative_Cooling_Tower)\n\nHere is the EnergyPlus object that I was using to model the downdraft tower:\n\n[http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/pa...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/page-018.html#zonecooltowershower)\n\nIt's truly brilliant stuff that the ancient Iranians developed thousands of years ago.\u00a0 That tower object blows most of the other passive strategies that I know out of the water vapor!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 11, 2015 at 3:10pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1418140", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1419929"}
