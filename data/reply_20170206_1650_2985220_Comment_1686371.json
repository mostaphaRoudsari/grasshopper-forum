{"body": "\nHello Nishant,\n\nYou assigned detailed HVAC system to OpenStudio.\n\nThen, From HB Read EP Result component outputs tool-tip:\n\n**Cooling**: The cooling energy needed in kWh. For Ideal Air loads, this output is the sum of sensible and latent heat that must be removed from each zone.For **detailed HVAC systems** (other than ideal air), this output will be electric energy needed to power each chiller/cooling coil.\n\n**Heating**: The heating energy needed in kWh. For Ideal Air loads, this is the heat that must be added to each zone. For **detailed HVAC systems** (other than ideal air), this will be fuel energy or electric energy needed for each boiler/heating element.\n\n-m\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "OH_Dimore", "created_at": "February 06, 2017 at 04:50PM", "created_by": "MohammadR", "parent_id": "topic_1686220", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1686371"}
