{"body": "\nHi Marco,\n\nThanks for the kind words- However credit goes to all the developers and in particular Chris Mackey for this new release.\n\n\n\nIf you are using EnergyPlus component it is using IdealAirLoads for calculation and you can apply COP values afterward. Chris recently added a new component that let you set up some of the parameters for IdealAirLoads system which might be of use for your project.\n\n\n\nIf you are modeling with OpenStudio and creating a system then check Coil components to set up COP values.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/nLML9an*avpd*T0aoNgi-70g1dIVnStjX5faKtv9ZkAPZwRht4G*TNGpm8t6lf1w0buI7EZUz2GYaPSUTa1YJ7NnQEISorY0/SetCOP.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nLML9an*avpd*T0aoNgi-70g1dIVnStjX5faKtv9ZkAPZwRht4G*TNGpm8t6lf1w0buI7EZUz2GYaPSUTa1YJ7NnQEISorY0/SetCOP.png)\n\nAlso see Dan's comments here:\u00a0[https://unmethours.com/question/2187/openstudioenergyplus-design-co...](https://unmethours.com/question/2187/openstudioenergyplus-design-cooling-and-heating-loads-0/)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 8, 2015 at 10:31pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1220841", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1221038"}
