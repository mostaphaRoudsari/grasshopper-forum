{"body": "\nHi Chien,\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you so much for fixing GrizzlyBear!\n\n\u00a0\n\nI have just heard back from DesignBuilder team, as you might expect, that the DB gbxml import mechanism are not reading the constructions/schedules data from the xml file at the moment.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, as my reply above, I was wondering if the gbXML file generated from Honeybee Zones and GrizzlyBear includes(defines) the information regarding these \"holes\" or \"virtual partitions\"? In other words, is it possible to automatically generated \"holes\" or \"virtual partitions\" (which allow airflow between thermal zones) in DB when importing the gbXML file (generated by Honeybee Zones and GrizzlyBear)?\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlternatively, can we just use Energyplus related components in Honeybee to get each different temperature of the subdivided thermal zones which compose the large thermal zone and allow airflow between them? How to achieve this? (Share surfaces between the subdivided thermal zones should be carefully treated to approximate the situation of airflow through \"holes\")\n\nGrateful for all your help!\n\n\u00a0\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "July 11, 2014 at 3:15am", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1100635", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1100408"}
