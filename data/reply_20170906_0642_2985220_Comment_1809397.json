{"body": "\nChris, sorry for the delay.\n\nIt was clear the definition of running mean temperature... \u00a0\n\n\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) \u00a0if I want to define the adaptive comfort chart for just a day of the above considered period (from\u00a018th to 31th July 2017), for example the\u00a025th July 2017, I have all hourly data of the previous week so I can define the ruuning mean temperature. In this case it is not required the full annual data stream of outdoor temperature. It's correct?\n\n2) if I use the\u00a0\"monthly average\" option,\u00a0in the case of a shorter period than one month, the average monthly value can be replaced by the average calculated on the basis of the available data. It's correct?\n\n<br/><br/>\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco", "created_at": "September 06, 2017 at 06:42AM", "created_by": "Francesco661", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1797463", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1809397"}
