{"body": "\nHi Wigg,\n\n\n\nThe True option for bakeIt_ bakes a colored hatch. If you set the option to 2 instead, you'd mostly likely get the result you are looking for. See the screencap below.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/n0YUr5BV56RiC7w4P07Vwru6Gj7zmqC44G1NEvj9lOiqfaMcH*QJxHMHS0WID9LfgoSuYOVbZwkRGWbEMXD3Nuhpk7rFcw9Y/exampleBake.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/n0YUr5BV56RiC7w4P07Vwru6Gj7zmqC44G1NEvj9lOiqfaMcH*QJxHMHS0WID9LfgoSuYOVbZwkRGWbEMXD3Nuhpk7rFcw9Y/exampleBake.png)\n\n\n\nThe grid size is almost inversely proportional to the number of faces created for analysis. In your model, for a gridsize of 6, I get\u00a0 100 faces. For a gridsize of 1 it is around 3700 faces, 0.5 - 15000 faces etc. So, a gridsize of 0.1 is likely to be around 370000 faces (which probably accounts for why your runtime and computational cost is so high). Considering that the cumulative sky model that generates these results resolves to 145 or 577 luminous patches only, at some point you'd start getting diminishing results from increasing the grid-sizes.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "July 12, 2017 at 12:00PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1782701", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1783126"}
