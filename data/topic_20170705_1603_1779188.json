{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI'm struggling with the Honeybee_False Color component, see the attached definition. I've tried everything I know - updated ladybug and honeybee, checked to make sure falsecolor2 and evalglare are located under my c:/radiance/bin folder - and the component appears to be working and is not giving me any errors but is not producing an image in the file path location... Any ideas?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1779187", "name": "HDR_FalseColor.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Heather Jauregui", "created_at": "July 05, 2017 at 04:03PM", "created_by": "HeatherJauregui", "topic": "False Color not generating an image", "id": "topic_1779188"}
