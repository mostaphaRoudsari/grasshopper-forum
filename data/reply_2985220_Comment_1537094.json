{"body": "\nHi Chris!<br/><br/>Thank you very much for your immediate answer and sorry if I could reply just today.<br/>Unfortunately I couldn't see the picture you attached but I did anyway what you said and the definition is now working perfectly!<br/>As regards the glazing surfaces, I wanted to try to define something similar to the\u00a0Envi-met\u00a0simulations, as I already mentioned, that's why I didn't put any glazing component in my definition. Moreover, I'm working in a XIX century urban context, so I assumed that accounting the glazing surface (that are just a little portion of the facades) wouldn't have changed too much the results of the simulation.<br/>Regarding the CFD simulation, I didn't know that there was a way to evaluate it in Grasshopper (and this is one of the reasons why I'm using\u00a0Envi-met\u00a0to have results to compare with the ones of Ladybug and Honeybee). I will read everything in the link you posted and maybe I will write here again!<br/><br/>Francesco\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Scarpati", "created_at": "May 26, 2016 at 2:32pm", "created_by": "FrancescoScarpati", "parent_id": "topic_1535086", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537094"}
