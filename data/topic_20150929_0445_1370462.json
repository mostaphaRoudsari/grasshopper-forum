{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nattached you will find two *.gh-files with the same building volume for heating demand simulation. One (*mz.gh) is divided in 11 zones, one (*sz.gh) where the zones correspond to the three levels.\n\nHeating demand results between these two models vary. Is it possible that it has to do with the \"air between adjacent zones will be automatically mixed\"-defaults?\n\nAnd, furthermore, how is it possible that the central zone doesn't get any (!) SHG? And why is the heating demand so high? (*.mz.gh)\n\nLooking forward for your suggestions and reflections.\n\nIf you need additional files (e.g. schedules) let me know. I think for having a look on the results to compare probably they won't be necessary. Defaults might be enough.\n\nThank you,\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1370461", "name": "150929_36_VF_SG_mz.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "September 29, 2015 at 04:45AM", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "topic": "AIR WALL ISSUES - QUESTION", "id": "topic_1370462"}
