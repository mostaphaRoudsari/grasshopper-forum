{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,<br/>Thank you for answer. I currently do not have any coding experience, but I am willing to learn! I'm a bit interested in coupling a Life Cycle Assessment to Ladybug/Honey Bee to try to minimize the overall carbon footprint of a building. I read a previous post that their is some work to be done in linking Tortuga to Ladybug that may be able to do this. Not sure where this is in development or how I could help.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>Jonny\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "JonnyK", "created_at": "May 05, 2016 at 05:56PM", "created_by": "JonnyK", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1524010", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1523920"}
