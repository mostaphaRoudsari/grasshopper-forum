{"body": "\nThank you YoungJae,\n\nD3.js has excel utilities.js that converts the data to json format but on the other hand, D3. Js is able to read a csv file too,... after separating the strings from the simulation data through the examples shown in the videos, can I still export the value with zone names to csv? I have been using excel/read/write but since the simulation output is a csv file, is it possible to send a clear \u2018 only numerical value\u2019 without strings (but I need zone names)?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nVinu\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "April 28, 2015 at 12:19am", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "parent_id": "topic_1274826", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1274924"}
