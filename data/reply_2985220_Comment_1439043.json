{"body": "\nI love to give this a try once I get a chance. Since I have done a simulation with more number of zones with Honeybee I don't think number of zones are a real limitation. I assume it is too much for GHPython component to handle since decomposeZone component input is accepting items and not a list. Have you tried to select a number of zone and connect them to the component? Like the first 40 zones?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 15, 2016 at 12:04am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1438998", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1439043"}
