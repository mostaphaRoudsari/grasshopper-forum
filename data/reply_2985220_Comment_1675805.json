{"body": "\nHi Nishant,\n\nThere's Honeybee_SplitBuilding Mass component that divides your zone in core and perimeter\u00a0zones. However, in your case, your floor is a non-convex surface so my guess is that component will not give you the desired result. The best things would be to create closed volumes manually based on orientation, thermal configuration, etc and then take them in Honeybee using Honeybee_ Masses2Zones component.\n\n-Devang\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "January 22, 2017 at 1:23am", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "topic_1676120", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1675805"}
