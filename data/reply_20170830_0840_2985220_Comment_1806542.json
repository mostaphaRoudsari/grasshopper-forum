{"body": "\nHi Peter,\n\n\n\nWhich analysis recipe are you using? There are differences on how Honeybee[+] loads the results based on the recipe.\n\n\n\nFor most of the recipes Honeybee[+] loads 2 * number of hours * number of blind state for each test point. The 2 is there because it loads the results for total and direct contribution separately. If you don't have dynamic blinds use the Annual recipe which is a flavor of daylight coefficient recipe that doesn't load the results to memory and just calculates the annual metrics.\n\n\n\nLet me know what is your goal and we can take it from there.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 30, 2017 at 08:40AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1806080", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1806542"}
