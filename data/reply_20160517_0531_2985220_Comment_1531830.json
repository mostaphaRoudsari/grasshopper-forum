{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI have done some test, but I obtained different results compared to the original simulation.\n\nThe problem seem to be related with the schedules and loads.\n\nLooking the values, it seems that it doesn't recognize the original settings (it uses e.g. medium office bldg occ instead the occupancy included in the idf).\n\nDo you have any tips in order to solve this problem?\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nAndrea\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1531831", "name": "testimport_forum_az.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1531832", "name": "modulo-sh-control2.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Andrea Zani", "created_at": "May 17, 2016 at 05:31AM", "created_by": "AndreaZani905", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1526304", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1531830"}
