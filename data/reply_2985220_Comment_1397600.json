{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nStarted to check the transformations components and i have to say (again) that i am impresed. Really cool.\n\nSaying that, so far, i've found two potential issues:\n\n1. Naming of zones. I get the following (connecting the red arrow in the attached to the solveAdjc):\n\n1. There are duplicate names in input zones. Zone names cannot be duplicate.<br/>Rename the zones and try again!\n\nI overcome this renaming one of the zones, but i believe that in a large case this can be a major issue.\n\n2. Normal direction pointing inwards on mirrored zones. In the rotated zone i get normals pointing inwards and outwards (weird).\n\nSee attached for these issues.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1397601", "name": "HB_Transformations.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 10, 2015 at 10:52am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1397679", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1397600"}
