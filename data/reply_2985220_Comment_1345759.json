{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\n\n\nFor the ones with duplicate installations your process should work.\n\n\n\nFor empty components it is almost always the result of not having GHPython installed correctly. It can be an issue with unblocking the component or not having the right version of GHPython component. Let them open a GHPython component and check the version and make sure it is 0.6.0.3\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KkxqEnBJGWAcQVxBGcPknSkLpSoXj4nQkGg6hEd000s7ZVP4uvhoXwRRYFAr7Pym-EKUxAbck-JUlISDMCAowQc1ot*xDQY8/GHPython_version.PNG\" width=\"664\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KkxqEnBJGWAcQVxBGcPknSkLpSoXj4nQkGg6hEd000s7ZVP4uvhoXwRRYFAr7Pym-EKUxAbck-JUlISDMCAowQc1ot*xDQY8/GHPython_version.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 19, 2015 at 9:01am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1345816", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1345759"}
