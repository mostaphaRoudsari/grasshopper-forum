{"body": "\nHi there Keisei,\n\nI've read the whole thread by now, nothing in it can solve this problem. Thing is, I am in the exact same situation as you. the resulting graph of my radiation analysis is only a huge blue tone on my subject of analysis.. everything shows up as 0 kWh/m2. I could work with the same files (.gh , .epw , and even .3dm) in other computers and its works perfectly fine, lots of detailed results come up.\n\nI can use Ladybug for other analysis (drybulb temperature analysis mostly) in my computer and its working well.. so I believe it isn't a LB problem.\u00a0<br/>I am using a mac with windows 7 through parallels.\n\nWere you able to solve this problem?\n\nOtherwise, does somebody know a solution to this problem? It's nightmare...!\n\nthanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Juan Pablo Costa", "created_at": "January 21, 2016 at 7:09am", "created_by": "JuanPabloCosta", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1427514", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1443904"}
