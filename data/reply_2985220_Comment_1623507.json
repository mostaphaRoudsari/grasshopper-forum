{"body": "\nJi and Antonello,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for finding this bug. \u00a0I can't believe that I made a mistake as simple as putting a \"&lt;\" when I should have put a \"&gt;\". \u00a0So the component was actually doing the opposite of what I said it was in the description.\n\n\n\nIn any case, I have fixed this on the github now and in the attached file.\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/f95825151bdfb10f...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/f95825151bdfb10f148fc6b7a8c1be85535e22f9)\n\n\n\nThank you again!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1623509", "name": "viewanalysisproblem_v002_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 23, 2016 at 10:41am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1623720", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1623507"}
