{"body": "\nHello, I have a question\n\n\n\nI have done my last daylight calculations in Diva (Rhino + Grasshopper) and there the workflow of building geometry was as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Building the geometry in Rhino\n\n2. Adding Radiance Materials to that geometry\n\n3. Exporting the Radiance File\n\n4. Go into Grasshopper and add the parametric geometry needed\n\n5. Set up the wanted daylight calculation via Diva for Grasshopper\n\n6. \"Switching on\" the add from Rhino option -&gt; this means having an exported File in the Temp folder (as from 3.)\n\n7. Running the calculation\n\n\n\nSo is there a workflow like that for Honeybee or do you need to add the geometry from Rhino as Breps in Honeybee and so on ?\n\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\n\ncheers Tom\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Lechner", "created_at": "October 08, 2014 at 08:05AM", "created_by": "ThomasLechner", "topic": "What is the best workflow regarding geometry?", "id": "topic_1145360"}
