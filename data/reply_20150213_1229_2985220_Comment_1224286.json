{"body": "\nChris, Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you again for your replies. I indeed overwrote the idf file and imported it to HB. I got slight higher consumptions especially during winter time since I changed the boundary ground/water conditions to be on average 7-10 degrees during winter time. I will not go further since the project I am working on is a floating neighbourhood that will be developed in Amsterdam and not a scientific research, as such the accuracy is adequate for now. I would like to investigate further though since in our region floating houses are being built quite often and submerged volumes are a good solution to the height restrictions there are due to local regulations and structural behaviour of such units. I am using both HB and LB for the overall analysis of the project and I would like to upload chunks of the work once is completed. The new releases are really helpful! \u00a0\n\nThanks again for your input!\u00a0\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 13, 2015 at 12:29PM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223960", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1224286"}
