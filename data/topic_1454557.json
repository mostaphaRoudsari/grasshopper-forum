{"body": "\nHi Honeybee-Experts,\n\nduring validation of a simple one-zone model, I recognized , that there is an unknown airflow in the summer. There should be only constant infiltration of 0.2 1/h and the air flow of a mechanical ventilation with 2.0 1/h during working time. The output \"air flow volume\" of the e+ component shows an additional airflow during the summer months - screenshots.\n\nNatural ventilation is not activated!\u00a0\n\nHas anybody an idea where I can stop this airflow in the model? Is it a bug in the components? You can find the gh-file is in the attachment.\n\n\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nBest\n\nSebastian\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1454554", "name": "air-flow-volume.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1454555", "name": "air-flow-volume-simparams.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1454556", "name": "ventilation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sebastian Sautter", "created_at": "February 4, 2016 at 9:04am", "created_by": "SebastianSautter", "topic": "unknown air flow volume", "id": "topic_1454557"}
