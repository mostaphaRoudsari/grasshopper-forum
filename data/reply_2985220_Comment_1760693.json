{"body": "\nI understood your point and agree too. But in this argument \"sun is lower and more perpendicular to the wall\" June has more radiation on the wall, then September/march and then December. In addition, this really make sense. (But didn\u00b4t happen on this way with my results)\n\nI did table and graphic (with numbers results for colors variations \u2013 red to blue) to expose better what is my point.\n\nLooking radiation roses, the sequence - September, June, December and March (my results to 10:00h) is similar what happened to direct radiation.\n\nThe sequence March, December, June and September, is similar what happened with diffuse radiance. (My results to 15:30h)\n\nThen the period 10:00 to 15:30h is similar to the graphics diffuse radiance too.\n\nSo I\u2019m thinking what\u2019s happening with my results, has more relation with radiation diffuse or direct (radiation roses), then with sun position. Because on this way March and September would be similar radiation. Do you agree? Is it correctly?\n\nIf this argument proceed, I did not found any theory that says that on the morning has more direct radiance or in the evening has more diffuse radiance. Do you know where these climate information are taken? To know if are reliable!\n\nThank you very much\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1760694", "name": "Results.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Camila Leone", "created_at": "May 31, 2017 at 9:18am", "created_by": "CamilaLeone", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1759336", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1760693"}
