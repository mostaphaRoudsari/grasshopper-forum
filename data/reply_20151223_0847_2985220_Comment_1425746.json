{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\u00a0\n\nthanks a lot for your reply!\n\nI\u00b4m trying to use that component you said but if i have shading with a certain transmittance, where should i put it? Because in the previous component i had the \"EPTransSchedule\" input, but now i haven\u00b4t. Any suggestion? maybe with the EPContruction input?\n\nAnyway i\u00b4m running both simulation, the daylighting one and the energy one.\u00a0\n\nIs still better use that component?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nClaudia\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "December 23, 2015 at 08:47AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1425574", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1425746"}
