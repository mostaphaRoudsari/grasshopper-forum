{"body": "\nHi!<br/><br/>When i input the surface attached in the example into the context shading component\u00a0it splits the surface into two. This creates problems for me further down the pipeline.<br/><br/>Why does it do it? (starting surface is checked to be planar)<br/><br/>If i merge the surfaces after the context shading component has done its work, will they continue to behave as they should in e+ and hb generator?<br/><br/><br/>\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1405353", "name": "context geometry question.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 7:58am", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "topic": "Honeybe E+ context shading component splitting surfaces", "id": "topic_1405354"}
