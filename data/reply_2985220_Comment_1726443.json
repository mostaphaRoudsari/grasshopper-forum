{"body": "\nOn my system it took between 1 minute to 30 seconds.\n\nTo answer your question about whether this is the right tool for the job, I'd say it is not. If you are running your solution the same way that you've shown in the gh file, then you are spending far too much time in doing things in Grasshopper and Rhino for every iteration. The fastest way to run all the iterations would be to set them all up and run them outside Grasshopper in one single sequence and then compare their results inside Grasshopper. This, however, will require a fair amount of scripting/programming.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "April 3, 2017 at 9:24am", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1725208", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726443"}
