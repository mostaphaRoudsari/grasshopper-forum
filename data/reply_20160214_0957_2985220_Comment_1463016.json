{"body": "Tim,\nWe should also clarify that Antonello's component calculates the solar position to a higher accuracy than the function which drives all other solar position calculations in Ladybug (including the LB sunpath). However, Antonello's component takes about 2 minutes to calculate 8760 values (a position for each hour of the year) and so it is not really practical to replace this primary function with Antonello's higher accuracy one.\nThe difference in accuracy is on the level of seconds and so this discrepancy in position really does not make much of a difference for the vast majority of applications. The exception is the calculation of sunrise and sunset, where the difference of a few seconds can be particularly important. So I think that it is appropriate that we have Antonello's component that is generally meant to calculate higher accuracy sun positions for special situations and for sunrise / sunset while the rest of Ladybug uses the quicker current function\nMostapha, let me know if you agree with this and I would be interested in hearing anyone else's thoughts.\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 09:57AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462795", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463016"}
