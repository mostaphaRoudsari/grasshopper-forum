{"body": "Mostapha,\nI'm glad that we are switching to this method even if it means taking out the ability to assign values based on orientation on a couple of components. Switching to list access should address a lot of issues that we experience with large honeybee definitions.\nI was just reflecting on the suggestion of using tree access to assign parameters based on orientation and I realized that there are a lot of other things that people will probably want to use the data tree for. I think it's better to have a separate component to assign constructions or boundary conditions based on orientation and I can draw these components up soon.\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 05, 2016 at 06:37AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1633617", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1633591"}
