{"body": "\nHey Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you so much for your educated answer. I will go over the links and suggestions you offered.\n\n\n\nI have to admit that indeed the 4th option is closer to what I was thinking. My idea was on the one hand to model the impact, on the microclimate of an area, of the creation of an urban environment. And on the other hand, to use this model to understand it, identify measures to reduce it, and quantify those impacts.\n\n\n\nI understand of course that a model is not necessary for all this. Most people know that more softscape, more vegetation, water bodies, reflective surfaces (to some extent), and more can help reducing UHI. What I want is to really understand the effect it has on the small, livable, scale (i.e. outside and around buildings, in pedestrian walkways, roads, squares, etc) of a community.\n\n\n\nI would love to know more about your \"moving out\" phase of your research, as it is one of my main goals in upcoming projects. Let me know if I can help (or participate) in any way.\n\n\n\nThanks again for your answer! Good luck!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 1, 2015 at 6:57am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1214695", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1215320"}
