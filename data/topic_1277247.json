{"body": "\nHello team,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if I could request a simple component for Honeybee.\n\n\n\nSometimes, during the set up of the model, I will combine zones in order to set zone loads and parameters (e.g. same types of spaces in order to apply ASHRAE 189.1 lighting power densities). However, the output of the set loads component (in this case) gives zones as referenced breps which makes it hard to decompose them.\n\n\n\nI was wondering if a component could be created that would allow an easy decomposition of the zones. For example, it would be very useful to select air conditioned zones out of a batch of honeybee zones (coming out of the solve adjacencies component for example).\n\n\n\nHope this seems useful to someone. Or it might be I need more efficient workflows.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 3:59am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Component request", "id": "topic_1277247"}
