{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI need your help, again! :) i' am having an issue with re-colouring meshes.\n\nWhat i am trying to do is to:\n\n-\u00a0take and read\u00a0the DF results from a previous analysis (HB_**Lookup daylighting folder, HB_import points file, HB_read RAD results**\u00a0components)\n\n- assign a colour to each value depending on the european standards (i.e. if DF &lt; 2.2, \"Red\", \"Green\"...). (**Evaluate** component)\n\n- Re-colour the meshes according to the standards (**Mesh colours** component)\n\nHere is my workflow:\n\n<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2DcIUccSeJzpn11My3CdAEiMQP4AZqAo2AomqB1XJFmwLC8xXU-1NFVohOTQ3bBxtWXqd47gSTEJZDc2WTWwQBE/workflow.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>And here below are both the results: the one on the left is what\u00a0I am trying to plot, meanwhile on the right there are the results from the re-colour mesh DF analysis. As you can see\u00a0the ones\u00a0on the left\u00a0are \"correctly\" following the isocurves i have drawn (one for each european standad i wanted to see),\u00a0BUT the colours are not correct at all (look to the ones on the right).\n\nDo you have any advice? Do you know why it is doing this funny thing?\n\nPS: In my workflow i have tryed also to direct input the analysis mesh output into the **mesh coulours** component but it wasn't working.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2AANBQt1XEkgUpSAcbVJLhamr-VXeoYW1dbsMf5AtP0KfR7pOFiCzx3q*1MEU0GKcVeagIQ*0Mq8HVscVwPaICd/falseresults.PNG\" width=\"528\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2AANBQt1XEkgUpSAcbVJLhamr-VXeoYW1dbsMf5AtP0KfR7pOFiCzx3q*1MEU0GKcVeagIQ*0Mq8HVscVwPaICd/falseresults.PNG)\n\nAnyone can help me?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nClaudia\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "February 15, 2017 at 03:04AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Colour meshes according to European Standards - issue", "id": "topic_1691941"}
