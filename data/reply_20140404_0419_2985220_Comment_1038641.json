I missed the Ladybug workshop unfortunately but will be keeping an eye on this page for when it is uploaded.\u00a0\n\nThanks Michal for showing the timezones - it's worth noting though for anyone in the UK that we're now in summer time, so it starts at\u00a0**2pm** for us, not 1pm.\n\nJames\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James Ramsden", "created_at": "April 04, 2014 at 04:19AM", "created_by": "JamesRamsden", "parent_id": "topic_1036755", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1038641"}
