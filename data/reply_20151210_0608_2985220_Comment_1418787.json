{"body": "\nDear Abraham,<br/><br/>thanks for your feedback.<br/>Unfortunately that doesn't solve my issue since even with more \"realistic\" values \u00a0(values like 0,02 m)\u00a0I get a bad shadeBrep output. I know that it's just for visualization, but I see its bad behaviour as an alarm alert.<br/>I put those huge values in the sample just to make the visualization of the problem easier to see.<br/>If I go to the IDF file my inputs looks right except for the angle that it in some way processed by HoneyBee according to the inclination of your window.<br/><br/>By the way we're talking about a very slightly inclinated roof. Still I have no ideas about the horizontal one.<br/><br/>Claudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Marini", "created_at": "December 10, 2015 at 06:08AM", "created_by": "ClaudioMarini", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1418684", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1418787"}
