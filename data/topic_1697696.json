{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am running a solar radiation analysis on a simple script with horizontal inclined louvers.\n\nI would like to find what is the best angle (genome) that generates the maximum total annual radiation (fitness) - using galapagos.\n\nEven after limiting the angle slider range between 40 &amp; 50 degrees - in order to reduce the processing time - when I start the solver, I can see the panel angle changing, but with no results.\n\n\n\nAny help?\n\nAttached the grasshopper script and a screenshot.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMany thanks!\n\n\n\nElias\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1697694", "name": "Capture.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1697695", "name": "Ladybug _ Solar Panels Test + Galapagos.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Elias Kateb", "created_at": "February 22, 2017 at 11:40am", "created_by": "EliasKateb", "topic": "Radiation Analysis + Galapagos", "id": "topic_1697696"}
