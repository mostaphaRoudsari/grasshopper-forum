{"body": "\nThere is a way, but it can be a bit tricky. If you have the plug-in called Human (get it at\u00a0[food4rhino](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/human?etx)), there is a component (Directory Contents) where you can see all files/folders within a folder. You can use that to look in your \"mother-folder\", where all your daylight analysis files are. Plug the complete list of contents from the \"mother-folder\" into the HB \"Lookup\u00a0Daylight Folder\" component, and you should be able to get the results.\n\nI,\u00a0however,\u00a0have had some issues with connecting multible paths into the daylight lookup component. Therefore it could be an idea to generate the file paths directly, with concatenate and using \"read file\" to get the data.\n\nHope it helps a little\n\n/Christian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Kongsgaard", "created_at": "September 26, 2016 at 9:29am", "created_by": "ChristianKongsgaard", "parent_id": "topic_1605873", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1605791"}
