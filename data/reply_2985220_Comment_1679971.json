{"body": "\nDevang,\n\nI am definitely in favor of the new outputs that you have added to the wind rose and the ability to assign colors outside of the component. \u00a0You can also use the native GH color mesh component to color the text rather than the python component in your example.\n\nThe only additional thing I am (and I think Bijit is) advocating for is that the default text for the speed frequency be a different color than black just for the sake of clarity to new users. \u00a0Even if it was just a different shade of dark grey, this would be helpful. \u00a0I don't think that we need to add another set of inputs on the component to change these default colors as people will always have the ability to override it outside of the component.\n\nLet me know if this makes sense.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 28, 2017 at 3:04pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1680120", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1679971"}
