{"body": "\nThanks Abraham,\n\nBy checking the definition, I actually realized that I was overlooking the fact that the zones were set as \"conditioned\", which was enabling the ideal air loads to take care of indoor temperature.\n\nI changed it and things are clearer, yet now I became intrigued by a discrepancy between what is reported by the \"conditionOfPerson\" and the \"percentOfTimeComfortable\" outputs. At first glance would seem that they are reporting the same thing in different manner, but they both provide different outcomes (See pic).\u00a0\n\nWhy is that the case?\n\nShouldn\u00b4t the \"conditionOfPerson\" output had to incorporate the values within the threshold of 80 or 90% (in case that is not happening)?\n\nAny comments?...\n\n\n\nPD: The AdaptiveComfortChart doesn\u00b4t provide any output data. Not that I wan\u00b4t to rush any one out to fix it, but I just want to report it.\n\n\n\nThanks!,\n\nAlejandro\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/lihD20i2jrzmwE9DGnuqaMY7Ai9*5fZr2BKCBhfHAKsy3wU4iytt2If*aiIqGe1*GoUNvZ9xtJ3B8BBc4gqaOVVRRnoPZO6Z/AdaptiveComfortCalculator2.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/lihD20i2jrzmwE9DGnuqaMY7Ai9*5fZr2BKCBhfHAKsy3wU4iytt2If*aiIqGe1*GoUNvZ9xtJ3B8BBc4gqaOVVRRnoPZO6Z/AdaptiveComfortCalculator2.png)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1313212", "name": "AdaptiveComfortCalculator2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Gamas", "created_at": "June 21, 2015 at 07:07PM", "created_by": "AlejandroGamas", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1312765", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1313210"}
