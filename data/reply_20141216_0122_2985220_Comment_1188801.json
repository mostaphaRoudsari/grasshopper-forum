{"body": "\nHi Mostapha: thanks for your interest.\n\nAt first I did get an error asking for the gendaymtx file which it could not find but I had already solved that downloading as you say the file from an older discussion.\n\n\n\nThe thing is now it is a .mtx file (depending from the .epw I think) which it cannot find now. I'm trying to make an evaluation for Santiago in Chile: I already downladed the Santiago.epw file but now it is asking (as you can see in the image I attached) for let's say Santiago.mtx and that one I don't know how to get.\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for your attention!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jose \u00c1ngel", "created_at": "December 16, 2014 at 01:22AM", "created_by": "JoseAngel", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1188602", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1188801"}
