{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nThis is my first post, so first of all, thank you very much to all who contributed to this great piece of software!\n\n\n\nIn order to use the object \"Site:GroundDomain:Slab\" in my EnergyPlus simulation, I need to set the boundary condition of my surfaces in contact with the slab to \"OtherSideConditionsModel\", but the \"CreateHBSrfs\" only allows \"ground\", \"adiabatic\" or \"Outdoors\" in the EPBC input.\n\n\n\nI have double clicked on the \"CreateHBSrfs\" and modified it as shown in the attached picture. It seems to work fine.\n\nI plan to use\u00a0additionalStrings_\u00a0input on the HB_RunEnergySimulation component to add the rest of the necessary objects (GroundTemperature, etc.).\n\n\n\nI have no experience with Python or any other programming language, so my question is: am I missing something?\n\n\n\nThank you very much!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1528155", "name": "HBPython.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1528156", "name": "HBPython2.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Jorge Conejo", "created_at": "May 11, 2016 at 12:08PM", "created_by": "JorgeConejo", "topic": "GroundDomain.
