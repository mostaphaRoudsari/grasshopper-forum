{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris, Abraham, Anton\n\n\n\nfollowing your suggestions, I have already changed HB daily schedule and HB annual schedule.\n\nThey seem very useful now.<br/>I also wrote a big list of holidays by country that is compatible with names of EPW files. Thus users can generate holiday DOYs automatically. In addition, I wrote an overwrite function that let users change holidays DOYs list manually or write directly without importing EPW files.\n\nI did not found holidays of these following countries:<br/>BLZ (CENTRAL AMERICA)<br/>BRN (SOUTH PACIFIC)<br/>GUM (SOUTH PACIFIC)<br/>MHL (SOUTH PACIFIC)<br/>PLW (SOUTH PACIFIC)<br/>UMI (SOUTH PACIFIC)<br/>[](https://energyplus.net/weather//)[https://energyplus.net/weather](https://energyplus.net/weather)\n\n\n\nMoreover, it is possible to connect daily schedule to Galapagos component, so it can also answer some strange questions.<br/>For example, what is the ideal daily occupancy schedule\u00a0for this type of building in this specific country?\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/9UfXGTHZGFLs5g58o8jZzkd-DjL5imTUX8fLw7E-BGGu897J1dX1HVxVpZEg0d9s-0XdBtJmae4nG0oUe-4n9FG2HZ*ycGuq/strangetest.png?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/9UfXGTHZGFLs5g58o8jZzkd-DjL5imTUX8fLw7E-BGGu897J1dX1HVxVpZEg0d9s-0XdBtJmae4nG0oUe-4n9FG2HZ*ycGuq/strangetest.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nI have attached an example to have a look at HB daily schedule &amp; HB annual schedule.\n\nPlease, let me know your opinion.\n\n\n\nBest<br/>Antonello\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1462844", "name": "example_HB_dailySchedule_annualSchedule.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 6:55am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462494", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462843"}
