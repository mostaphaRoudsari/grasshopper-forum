{"body": "\nKill me but the above example now works. Before E+ simulation crashed complaining about missing material definitions.\n\nSo forget about this.\n\nBut i've found another couple of things. It is with the readEPResult component. The normByFloorArea_ input. When it is False the results shown with the HB_ColorZones component are already in m2. Setting it to true gives also results by m2. The difference is that in the first case the legend says \"kWh/mters2\" and in the second 'kWh/m2\".\n\nAlso when you hook the Legend output of the HB_ColorZones to a preview component it shows only the colored scale but not the text.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 4, 2014 at 6:16am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1180725", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1180848"}
