{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nGlad that you found the balance point input and I agree with your suggestion about the passive solar polygon. I just pushed a change to the psych chart that pulls the passive solar polygon to the edge of the comfort polygon whenever \"Capture Internal Heat Gain\" is not selected:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/559cdb46ae38eff5...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/559cdb46ae38eff5390d32bb26332efa1a41e736)\n\nI am aware that 12.8 C is a relatively low balance point and I can say that, in my personal experience, the lowest balance point that I ever found was 10 C for a well-insulated cafeteria, while the highest balance point that I have ever found was 18 C for a pretty poorly insulated residence. \u00a0I got the default balance point of 12.8 C from climate consultant, which uses the same default value. \u00a0I am open to changing it but I can say that balance points of 12.8 C are somewhat common in the colder part of the world where I live, where the building codes keep the insulation high. \u00a0I'd agree that the default polygon is definitely more of a \"maximum possible potential\" from internal heat gain capture but I would say that all of the strategy polygons on the chart are following a similar \"maximum possible\" principle. If you feel that we should be showing realistic implementations of each strategy rather than ideal ones, we can discuss it here further.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 4, 2017 at 9:28pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1808531", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1808863"}
