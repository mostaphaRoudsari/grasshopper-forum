{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm exporting baked geometry to Illustrator. It works fine, but when i do that in a perspective view the legend and title are not showing in Illustrator. In plan view it works fine.\n\nBaking the legend from the output components seems to work fine.\n\n\n\nThis can be an LB+HB issue or is more Rhino related?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 24, 2016 at 04:42AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "Bake options - Perspective legend issues", "id": "topic_1491414"}
