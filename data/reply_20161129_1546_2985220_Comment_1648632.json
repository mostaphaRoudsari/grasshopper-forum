{"body": "\nHi Leland,\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for you thoughts. What you mention makes a lot of sense and I feel that it would help a lot in schematic/design development stages of a real life project where higher accuracy results for different design alternatives are needed. I haven't thought of manipulating on that level, it sounds very interesting.\n\n\n\nFor my case, since this is on a concept design level, the number of combinations in an actual practical model (which should be in the tenths of millions) makes even this reduction impractical.\n\n\n\nHowever, ML can also be used for exactly this thing, what is called dimensionality reduction. By producing millions of different design alternatives opens new potential for statistical studies of models and results. One of the processes embedded in ML is feature (i.e. parameter) selection where the parameters that end up not being important can be ommitted. In a way this is similar, but also different I imagine, to what you describe only one step earlier and with less resources.\n\n\n\nInteresting stuff! Let's see where they lead!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "November 29, 2016 at 03:46PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1648511", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1648632"}
