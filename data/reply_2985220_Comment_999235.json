{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks a lot for your detailed explanation.\n\nMy comment is not related to the criteria (which can be implemented with existing LB components). It is more related to the created geometry.\n\nProbably i wasn't clear in my explanation, so now i'm attaching a screenshot. In the Envelope, and assuming that the BaseSurface is your design plot, you see that the volume is extending beyond the plot limits towards the south. For this case the limit of the volume should rise vertically.\n\nAs for the Fan, it is about the same, just that a portion of the volume is missing towards the north, without affecting the required performance (analysis period).\n\nThis results happen depending on my analysis period definition. In this case, months: 9-12, hours_ 10-14. Which seem to me reasonable for autumn/winter seasons.\n\nSaying that i know that my comment goes beyond the vector checking. That's why i said is kind of wish list.\n\nHope this is clear now and thanks again!!\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A999236", "name": "Capture.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 29, 2014 at 11:26pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_999225", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_999235"}
