{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nthanks for your reply and clearing my question even more. Indeed they are \u00a0three questions that I am trying to approach in a step wise fashion and thanks for giving me feedback.\n\n\n\nRelating to your comments:\n\n\n\n1.Thanks for the link. I followed up and seems exactly what I was looking for. I will try to add it in my definition and run the analysis again and post the files here\n\n2. What we are currently doing is running experiments in an IVE \u00a0with users and we register what is their light preference (daylight+artificial Light) for implementing a set of office related activities (ie reading, typing etc). We want then to use the collected data in order to generate user based light schedules, so that we can feed it into the analysis.\n\nThanks for the reference I checked the example file and I was wondering if there could be way to integrate the annual results with that of data collected from users.\n\n\n\n3. What I started developing in java (attached image) is an agent based generative panel that I want to control its growth and geometry by the radiation analysis and achieve various degrees of light diffusion initially by geometry and then look into materiality. for now I am working with an opague RAD material\n\n\n\nThanks for your input. Will keep you posted with further progress\u00a0\n\nBest,\n\nEvan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1187139", "name": "Screenshot 2014-12-08 02.04.12.png"}], "created_by_name": "Evangelos Pantazis", "created_at": "December 12, 2014 at 6:56pm", "created_by": "EvangelosPantazis", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184825", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1187137"}
