{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThanks so much for doing this detailed testing. It's extremely helpful.\n\nYes I've constrained the period from the summer solistice to the autumn equinox.\n\nAnd yes, you're correct that the DIVA envelope has set it's cutoff date for December 21, while mine is set to September 22.\n\nI think you're right about flexibility. I'm thinking about allowing the users to select between March 21, June 21, Sept 21 and Dec 21 (the solistices/equinoxes) as the key beginning and cutoff points. What do you think about this? I don't want to allow users to choose any date because (in my tests with students at my school) - most don't know enough to choose these optimal points.\n\n<br/>As for the bugs, I think you were using the compnents from here correct: [https://github.com/saeranv/cityGraph](https://github.com/saeranv/cityGraph) ? That's where I started developing the components but for the record the most up to date components will be here - my forked repo of ladybug: [https://github.com/saeranv/ladybug](https://github.com/saeranv/ladybug) . That bug is fixed in those components.\n\nI'll make sure to send a pull request to Mostapha/Chris when I make significant changes, but the changes will first be made in my forked repo.\n\nI'll make another post with the next iteration of the components - and show you the instances where the fan changes drastically from DIVA's model.\n\n\n\nThanks again Abraham,\n\n\n\n- Saeran\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "February 05, 2014 at 02:17PM", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1003227", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1003596"}
