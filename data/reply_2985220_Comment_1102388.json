{"body": "\nHey Claudio,\n\nThe split bldg masses component is meant to split up entire building masses into individual zone breps. \u00a0It isn't made to split up a single zone. \u00a0If you are running a single zone through such a splitting component, you do not want to set a perimeter depth or else you get something like the attached images as your starting zones. \u00a0\n\n\n\nBy plugging the output of this splitting into the glazing generator without first going through the solve adjacencies component, the component will assume that all walls are exterior and generate glazing on them accordingly.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1102389", "name": "Split Building Masses Misuse.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 15, 2014 at 1:15pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1102370", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1102388"}
