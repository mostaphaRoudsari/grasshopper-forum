{"body": "\nAbraham and Grasshope,\n\nI apologize for being so lat to the conversation. \u00a0The stable release last week took a lot of time and, now that we are well past it, I can get down to addressing all of the discussions.\n\nThe heart of the problem was a math domain error that was occurring in the function that calculates indoor air stratification, which is ironic as this was a simulation that did not have any indoor test points. \u00a0This has now been fixed in the attached file and on the github.\n\nThe second issue was that the month was off by 1 when you connected up an HOY and this has also been fixed now.\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/d45ac37bc8b9db3...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/d45ac37bc8b9db3f76aa5d9fcc00687394b9ef5d)\n\n\n\nMy last comment is a suggestion to break up the ground top surface into several surfaces as this allows the temperature maps to account for spatial differences in ground temperature across the scene. \u00a0This is what I do in this file here:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Outdoor_Microclimate_Map&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\nThanks for getting down to the cause of issues like this one. It really makes these bugs much easier to fix. Between the both of you, I feel you can take credit for over 90% of the bug fixes in the community.\n\nGreat job, as always,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1454146", "name": "typology_v053_simple_geom_AY_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 03, 2016 at 03:41PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1449649", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1454144"}
