{"body": "Tim and Abraham,\n\nGlad that you find the feature useful. I didn't realize how necessary it was until I started making all of my presentations at my office with this component a few months ago.\n\nTim,\nThere's a chance that you may have found the first bug. I was able to make the transparency work for most typical solid-color backgrounds but I might have missed some important ones. Also, the current implementation won't work if you have a gradient background. If you can upload your Rhino file with the view (and display mode) that you are trying to capture, I should hopefully be able to re-create the error on my end and fix it.\n\nAlso, I should mention that all of your feature suggestions on this forum have been great and please keep posting them. If we are silent, it is only because we know some features might take a while to implement and many of us have our hands full with bug fixes and revisions of the code for the LB+HB API. We will hopefully get around to your suggestions eventually. This said, if you are ever motivated to implement some of these features that you have mentioned (like HUDs, etc.), I would be happy to point you towards the Python resources from which I learned to code a couple years ago. If you get through that, I'm also happy to give a crash course in GHPython via Skype.\n\nStay awesome,\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 12, 2016 at 10:52AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1506819", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1506887"}
