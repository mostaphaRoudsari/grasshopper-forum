{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nProbably Chris will answer much better than i do this discussion, but i'll try in short:\n\nQ1. I think this is what the component does or maybe i don't get the qustion.\n\nQ2. You can use the conditionalStatment input for this one (connect the windDirection to the annualHourlyData input and set the proper condition, i.e. b&gt;225 and b&lt; 315, for the west section).\n\nQ3. It is. See also that you can set the terrain condition. See also the reference in the hint of the component.\n\nQ4. Probably usefull for CFD simulations, but for the purposes of this component is not bringing any additional result.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 5, 2015 at 9:49pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1237552", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1237563"}
