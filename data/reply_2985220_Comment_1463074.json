{"body": "\nFor now, what are the definitions that are dumped and loaded? Just geometry? Didn't understand what yo wrote about the materials/constructions.\n\nBy now you'll say that the stage where you better do the dump is after the solveAdjacencies? Even there some definitions can be lost (materials, others)?\n\n\n\nHi Abraham. Everything gets dumped and then loaded by the components. The issue that I mentioned happens because in case of materials, constructions and schedules HBObjects carry the name and the address and not the full data. For instance if you have schedule set to c:\\yourschedule.csv it will be saved correctly but just as a string to this address. This means if you load the objects on a different machine and try to run the simulation it will look for\u00a0c:\\yourschedule.csv and if that's not available it will fail running the simulation. It's the same with custom materials and constructions. HBObjects just carry the name and not the full definition.\n\nI can add the option to save all the material, construction and schedules full definition with the file but it will results in potentially a much larger file. Currently there is no easy way to know if a material/construction or schedule is custom or is coming from the library so I have to save all the constructions and schedules with the objects. It also includes RADMaterials.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 4:58pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463014", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463074"}
