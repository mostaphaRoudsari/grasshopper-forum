{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI am currently trying to receive the maximum luminance values from falsecolour images in a number format. I know how to get the extrema printed on the falsecolor image, however I will have to analyze a high number of images, so manually typing them is not a solution for me.\n\nIs there a command or a component where I can get the maximum luminance value for an image?\n\nBest regards,\n\nFlorian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Florian Wochele", "created_at": "March 29, 2017 at 06:04AM", "created_by": "FlorianWochele", "topic": "Maximum luminance as number output from falsecolor image", "id": "topic_1723264"}
