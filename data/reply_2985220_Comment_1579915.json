{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\n\nthanks for the advice! I'll make sure not to mess with the tolerances...\n\nAs for the object snaps, I always use them but sometimes it can be tricky if there are tiny gaps in the underlying floor plan, so one has to be very careful not to snap to the line that lies a nanometer awway from the last one. Thus, when snapping to a neighboring zone it's better to hide the floor plan in order to reduce the risk of not snapping to the geometry that's already drawn. Can be annoying though...\n\nCheers!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Albert Pressler", "created_at": "August 10, 2016 at 12:43pm", "created_by": "AlbertPressler", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579819", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579915"}
