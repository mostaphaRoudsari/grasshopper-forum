{"body": "\nHi John,\n\nI finally found a chance to check your script. As you said it works fine. An alternative approach with less intersections and select items\u00a0would be:\n\n1. create the target plane based of sun vector and desired distance,\n\n2. project the window curve on the plane,\n\n3. offset the projected curve on the plane (will be much faster than offset curve on surface)\n\n4. project the curves back onto the geometry\n\n5. Loft the curves together\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 15, 2013 at 02:59PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_912624", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_915329"}
