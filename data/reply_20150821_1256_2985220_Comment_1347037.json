{"body": "\nChris, Claudio, Abraham,\n\nThank you all for your swift responses!\u00a0\n\n@ Chris, thanks for your very extensive explanation, I'm about to tryout what you described above and let you know how it turned out. What I figured yesterday is that the increase in radiation because of the reflective facade for the 'worst' month is only about 2-3 kWh/m2 as your looking at a value of 80 without and 82-83 kWh/m2 with reflection.\u00a0\n\nSo my assumption is that the glare factor will play a much bigger role instead of intensity of the sun, looking at comfortable levels. So I'm looking in this as well. It's very cool to play around with these plugins and see the outcome. I'll keep you guys posted.\n\n@ Claudio, that was exactly my problem as well. I presented a direct sunlight hour analysis, to show the increase in direct sunlight hours because of the mirrored facade and at what times of the day the reflections occurred. But it is hard to asses if this is 'bad' or 'good'. The restaurant in question receives more or less 130 direct sunlight hours 'naturally' in the worst month and because of the reflection the result was 161 direct sunlight hours, but the client was like okay..... and is this a problem? So we decided to look at sun intensity but I didn't want to fall into the trap of in the end presenting kWh/m2 and having the same problem not knowing if this is 'comfortable' or 'annoying' etc. Good luck with your study, I'll post my findings\n\n\n\nThanks again guys\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Arie-Willem de Jongh", "created_at": "August 21, 2015 at 12:56PM", "created_by": "aw", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619297", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1347037"}
