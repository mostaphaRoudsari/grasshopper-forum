{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI have a problem while trying to iterate through 10 different glazing ratios, writing the results to an excel file each time.\n\n\n\nThe problem arises following the Daylight analysis, where the results are to be read, before being sent to the energy plus component.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEssentially the \"readAnnualResultI\" component does not update/run by itself following a succesful daylight analysis, and so my loop doesnt work.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny help greatly appreciated, thanks.\n\n\n\nWill\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1575135", "name": "FacadeIterator_v5.gh"}], "created_by_name": "William Allen", "created_at": "August 2, 2016 at 11:01am", "created_by": "WilliamAllen", "topic": "ITERATIVE ENERGY SIM + DAYLIGHTING: Solution exception:index out of range: 0 from \"Read Annual ResultsI\" component", "id": "topic_1575136"}
