{"body": "Hey Chris,\n\nThank you so much for the link ill check it out in the morning. I already started building geometries room per room (one room per brep).\n\nCan't wait for the indoor comfort tools I'm going to actually beta test them on real project and real data. Goal is to analyse comfort per space and during the hours of the day to propose optimised schedules for the HVAC system.\n\nAt least I think I can :)\n\n-Theodore", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 05, 2015 at 08:50AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1216865", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1217925"}
