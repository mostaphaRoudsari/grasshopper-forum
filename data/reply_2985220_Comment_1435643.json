{"body": "\nHello Theodoros,\n\nBoth the Sandia and Equivalent One Diode models in EnergyPlus, predict the efficiency of PV panels by calculating the back of the panel temperature, however, Sandia\u00a0model consists of a series of empirical relationships with coefficients that are derived from actual testing. Arguably, it is one of the most accurate prediction models for solar panel generation.\u00a0\n\nI know for sure\u00a0Greg Barker in 2003, working for the NREL implemented the Sandia model in FORTRAN77 as a custom type (Type101) for the TRNSYS computer program. so i guess TRNSYS has this algorithm.\n\ncheers,\n\nMohamed\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mohamed Elsayed", "created_at": "January 10, 2016 at 5:51am", "created_by": "MohamedElsayed", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435481", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435643"}
