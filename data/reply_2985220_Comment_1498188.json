{"body": "\nThanks for both your answers, I will try all that. Sounds logical.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have other questions, since I am trying to optimize the design of shading devices, in the steps I am following to link GH to the software I am using which is ModeFrontier, in order to collect the data I have to give the same level of priority to _HBZones than HbContext_ and for now the component is set for the context to be optional is there a way to make the component to take context as mandatory? Although Chris\u00b4s answer simplifies everything a lot isn\u00b4t it more precise from an energy model?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Luis E.
