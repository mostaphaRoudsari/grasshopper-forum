{"body": "\nDear Chris, thank you very much for your prompt reply!\n\n\n\nHowever, the problem is not solved after I unblock the two files in the directory C:\\Users\\oat\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\\, and restart the computer.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pYo728rS*VE75JWBlPd4s2LSksyrpMQiycw86yd-3u62hnyH1LE**o1c2kIA4tlQNWmEfpM0xSFDxrRPssXgAZiBC-Lp0clm/1.PNG\" width=\"408\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pYo728rS*VE75JWBlPd4s2LSksyrpMQiycw86yd-3u62hnyH1LE**o1c2kIA4tlQNWmEfpM0xSFDxrRPssXgAZiBC-Lp0clm/1.PNG)\n\nI also tried the GH unblock file created by [Marios Tsiliakos (http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profiles/blogs/unblo...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/MariosT) But I assume it only checks the LB&amp;HB user components which don't include the two files mentioned above.\n\n\n\nPlus, I also found that the right-click menu option for unblock is not working using Marios' file... I didn't even get the windows to remind me the change of the registration key ... Anyway, I shall probably email Marios in this regard.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pYo728rS*VHTc84pDIfom93DE8k47EVr4n-sn52EsDREP5U11CpXOibazlj652md3IG*s-ojagqoP5LlQj6OxcYEtXQxAjN1/02.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pYo728rS*VHTc84pDIfom93DE8k47EVr4n-sn52EsDREP5U11CpXOibazlj652md3IG*s-ojagqoP5LlQj6OxcYEtXQxAjN1/02.PNG)\n\nI also installed multiple version of EnergyPlus in case it is related to a specific version of EP: v8.1.0, v8.2.7, v8.3.0, v8.4.0\n\n\n\nSo, I'm kind of stuck here... with all the solutions checked so far ....\n\n\n\nPlease kindly advise if I shall check other things that may have caused this issue ...\n\n\n\nThank you very much!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "October 04, 2015 at 12:25AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1372804", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1372856"}
