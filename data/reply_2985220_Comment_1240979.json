{"body": "\nGreat work Chris! I'll try out the updated glazing by ratio component when I get a chance.\n\nAs mentioned, I've decided to use 'addHBGlz' instead and it works fine now. I think the problems in my previous reply had to do with the data management, grafting/flattening the geometries affected how 'SolveAdjecencies' acted. I got it working by solving adjacencies in two steps, firstly for each floor and secondly for the whole building. Not as neat but it works fine.\n\nI have another question though: Each time I start up Rhino+Grasshopper my custom constructions has disappeared from the EP construction library and I have to re-add them. Sometimes they also disappear when I've had the model open for a long time. Is there a way to store them permanently in the lib? I don't fully understand if they are stored locally or not?\n\nAlso, are there some documentation on Daylight Factor? The simulation works perfectly, it's a really great feature that it support multiple cores and has a quality setting! Priceless when trying out multiple designs. But I cant wrap my head around how to set north and location (or .epw)?\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sverker Dahlblom", "created_at": "March 12, 2015 at 3:06am", "created_by": "SverkerDahlblom", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1241116", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240979"}
