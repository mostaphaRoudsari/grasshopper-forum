{"body": "\nHi Paul,\n\nI fixed the bug. We only update the files on food4Rhino for every release so you need to download it from github (or use update component).\n\nBack to your question for each surface, the results are grafted for each input surface. So if you already break the test surfaces for each room you only need to average the results and you will have a single number for each. You can match them with original input surfaces or use \"analysisMesh\" output which is unjoined meshes.\n\n\n\nI hope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 4, 2015 at 4:34pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_792125", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256522"}
