{"body": "\nLeland,\n\nInteresting observation and yes, the radiation should line up with the hour lines (or lamellas) of the sunpath. \u00a0Radiance is only calculating the sky on an hourly time step since the EPW file is on an hourly time step and so this is why that happens. \u00a0On a tregenza sky dome with a lot less patches, you would never be able to see this phenomenon but the high resolution of the Reinhart sky allows this to be visible. \u00a0You are peering into the limits of the simulation assumptions. \u00a0Interesting stuff.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 5, 2014 at 1:50pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1162496", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1162772"}
