{"body": "\nHi Evan,\n\n\n\n2. I was wondering if there could be way to integrate the annual results with that of data collected from users\n\nIt is possible for sure. You just need to generate a .csv file.\n\n\n\n3. Sounds like an interesting idea. I like to know more about this and how you are trying to do this. Are you using annual simulation to measure the effect or some runs for a number of different times?\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: I will go to LA next year in Feb. for a conference. Maybe I should stop by at USC and UCLA. Looks like there are so many interesting stuff happening around similar topics.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 15, 2014 at 11:12pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1187137", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1188659"}
