{"body": "\nThank you Abraham for looking into this one.\n\n\n\nI expected that this would work on someone else's machine. My guess is, this is not a LB+HB issue. If I supply a different geometry (A few Zones), it works at my end as well.\n\n\n\nMy rhino tolerance is the same. I did not fully understand your comment on default folder path. Can you please elaborate on that? I have a latest version of LB+HB that works without providing any file paths.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "February 16, 2017 at 01:01AM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1692815", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1692588"}
