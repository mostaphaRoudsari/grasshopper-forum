I think that was the only issue with your simulation as the materialFile was missing in the simulation. I have attached the gh file and also the IES file that\u00a0 I used.\n\nI think the dimensions of your space and also the light fixture are probably large for a small lamp like the one that I used. So, I had to crank up the candela multiplier to a high value and adjust the exposure to spread enough light in the scene. If you use the same IES file in a smaller room, you should get proper results.\n\nRegarding your OpenStudio question, I have raised an\u00a0[issue](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/548) on github with Mostapha and Chris about this. Lets see what they have to say about it..\n\nSarith\n\n\n\n(Great model for the light fixture by the way! I have no idea how to create a shape like that in grasshopper)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1584448", "name": "v0_180h0.ies"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1584449", "name": "monatrail4S.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "August 19, 2016 at 08:22PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1584088", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1584447"}
