{"body": "\nJulian,\n\n21km/h isn't an unreasonable wind speed at the window but I should admit that the default means of calculating window-based wind-driven cross ventilation assumes that there are even-sized windows on each side of the zone. \u00a0As such, you might want to make just 2 custom wind and stack objects that both have an effective area of the smaller window but have opposite angles2North (for this, you can use 2 SetEPAirflow components in tandem). You also might want to decrease this area further to account for other obstructions like insect screens (if you have them). \u00a0If you are mostly counting on the wind, it might also be a good idea to set the stackDischargeCoeff to 0. \u00a0So, in total, your wind speed is probably a bit less than what you currently have but I don't think that you are too far off.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 11, 2016 at 03:59PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1597104", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1597358"}
