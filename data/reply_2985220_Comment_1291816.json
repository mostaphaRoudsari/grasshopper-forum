{"body": "\nHi Andrew!\n\nI'm new to Ladybug and so far I've been able to achieve a lot by reading through the forum. Please excuse me if I am wrong when asking.<br/>I've been trying to get your \"Mesh to Illustrator\" to work, but I guess there is something I am doing wrong. The hatches I get after baking are \"open surface\" and all of them are black, I am not getting the radiation color.\n\nHere are some screenshots of my project.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/jEI2iEfKUOgAhtpAcwvCSArUzc*du1U2O3g8fMDMrEPR*sAljRe5vKFIbFSGN5AhfBuyZvIUKR9vgBSHXvMXlhfuKydy*7mw/grasshopper.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/jEI2iEfKUOgAhtpAcwvCSArUzc*du1U2O3g8fMDMrEPR*sAljRe5vKFIbFSGN5AhfBuyZvIUKR9vgBSHXvMXlhfuKydy*7mw/grasshopper.png)\n\nThe first one shows how I have attached the components, just like your example.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/jEI2iEfKUOhRqBvzvhTssycukSJSMvfFrGNRMhDv6zmNG9Uw*x80Qdb9rINS*GnyYK30NdB75KwvPRwL7IJES15y5DuQAKP-/Mcol.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/jEI2iEfKUOhRqBvzvhTssycukSJSMvfFrGNRMhDv6zmNG9Uw*x80Qdb9rINS*GnyYK30NdB75KwvPRwL7IJES15y5DuQAKP-/Mcol.png)\n\nThe second one shows the preview component in gh (left) and rhino (right)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/jEI2iEfKUOg04iL0JxFn26DlQhmJc3TS3tOV0Pl9LOgkiJa0QHD2a*UaWquy8RBFP0PgOmg3q1Qr0G4q7zNSNBAcXt9cS8h*/rhino.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/jEI2iEfKUOg04iL0JxFn26DlQhmJc3TS3tOV0Pl9LOgkiJa0QHD2a*UaWquy8RBFP0PgOmg3q1Qr0G4q7zNSNBAcXt9cS8h*/rhino.png)\n\nThe third one shows the radiation mesh (right) and the result of the pseudo-make2D hatches (left)\n\n\n\nAny idea of what I am doing wrong?\n\nThank you!!\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jose S", "created_at": "May 21, 2015 at 1:17pm", "created_by": "JoseS", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1278524", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1291816"}
