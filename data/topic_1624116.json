{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI'm having a bit of an issue with one of my thermal models. I am trying to model a building with double height spaces and internal balconies (thus ariwall adjacencies galore) using the solve adjacencies component in HB.\n\n\n\nI am having the following issue: I am solving adjacencies a few times, first solving for the entire model without air walls, then only connecting those with air walls as adjacencies etc... however, every time I I have to remove current adjacencies in order to create new air walls or adiabiatic walls which removes any other adjacencies I had before (internal floors etc...).\n\n\n\nMy question therefore is, what is the best approach to create holes/airwalls on certain surfaces only? I am considering working on a hybrid script that creates air walls in the same way the Honeybee_addHBGlz component works but maybe there's no need to go through that effort.\n\nThanks in advance!<br/><br/>Antoine\n\n\n\nPS: GH file attached with 3 different types of geometry I am trying to get into HB (thermal zones, empty zones from double height spaces, adiabiatic adjacencies).\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1624115", "name": "Adjacency Issues.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antoine Dao", "created_at": "October 24, 2016 at 2:01am", "created_by": "AntoineDao", "topic": "Modelling Double Height spaces + Holes/Airwalls", "id": "topic_1624116"}
