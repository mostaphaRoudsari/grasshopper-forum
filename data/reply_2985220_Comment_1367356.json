{"body": "\nFahimeh,\n\nI think you're confusing two different topics together. My understanding is that you're getting two different optimum options based on the result of the optimization algorithm. It can have several reasons such as finding a local optima instead of the global optima, or having a weak objective function. This doesn't necessary have to do with Honeybee's daylight analysis. To have a better understanding about what is happening you can re-run the best cases against each other and compare the results. Your problem may have several local optima.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 23, 2015 at 10:06am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1367259", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1367356"}
