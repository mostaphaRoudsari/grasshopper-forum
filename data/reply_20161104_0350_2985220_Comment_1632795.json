{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI've tried as you say, but this overwrites all of the ground temperatures throughout the model. That's not a favourable solution IMO.\n\nI'd like to simulate one single zone. 1 of the surfaces is connected to the ground; 2 of the surfaces should be set to a constant temperature of 21 deg (as these are apartments which I assume to have a constant temperature as these are not in focus).\n\nSo I'm looking for a fourth option to the EPBC_ input in 'createHBSrfs' that says 'constant temp.' or something similarly instead of just adiabatic, outdoors or ground; it's neither of those.\n\n- Lasse\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lasse Hamborg", "created_at": "November 04, 2016 at 03:50AM", "created_by": "LasseHamborg", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1629547", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1632795"}
