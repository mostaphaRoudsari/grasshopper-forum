{"body": "\nDing,\n\nYour findings are not a big surprise.\n\nWhat i recommend you is to define in parallel the different parameters of the lighting for both E+ and Daylight simulations. When you get to the point that ALL parameters are equal you probably will get similar results. At this point, without checking your file thoroughly i can bet that there are basic differences and hence the differences in the results. Among the different parametres i would check are: Control, Lighting levels, Schedules, etc.\n\nI myself will be glad this comparison between both simulation types. Please upload the file when you get there. I suppose that for this task Mostapha/Chris can help a bit. I think an example file like this can be very useful.\n\nGood luck,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 4, 2015 at 12:08pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1280156", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280234"}
