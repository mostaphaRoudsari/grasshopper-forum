{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks for your answer.\n\nExternal blinds are now more \"sensible\" to the need of providing somehow daylighting and not only privacy. Smart blinds allow to set different degrees of slit openness. So somehow it can be useful to have this feature.\n\nIf possible i would think about making this as a horizontal break with a density defined by the user (somehow). I also don't think that this degree of detail is very useful.\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 6, 2016 at 11:12am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1542824", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1542707"}
