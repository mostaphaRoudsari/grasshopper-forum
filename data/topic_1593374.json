{"body": "\nHi guys\n\nI have problems with annual daylight analysis :\n\n\n\n\n\n1.my shading geometry is complex and it's created with mesh and I need to make some RAD file for computing because with HBsurface i got an error :\n\noconv : Warning - non-planar vertex for polygon \"....\"\n\nrtrace_dc : warning - non-planar vertex for polygon \"....\"\n\ni think it ignores some\u00a0 faces .\n\ni checked the model and didn't find any non-planar one!!!\n\nwhen it converts to RAD with \"MeshtoRAD\" component there is another problem :(\n\nit ignores \"additionalRadFiles\" in \"Honeybee_Annual Daylight Simulation\" but it works with \"imageBasedSimulation\" recipe !!!\n\n\n\n\n\n2.the second problem is with \"Honeybee_Daysim Shading State\" i just gets \"shdHBObjects\" not RAD files!!!\n\nit works slow with shdHBObjects because of complex geometry and multiple states for shading\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n3.the third problem is about number of shading_state :\n\nin \"Honeybee_Advanced Dynamic Shading Recipe\" i think there is no limit but in Daysim'site it has\u00a0 been mentioned that \"The user may of course model other shading systems in any state imaginable up to a total of ten states per shading group.\"\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mostafa", "created_at": "September 4, 2016 at 11:26am", "created_by": "mostafa", "topic": "Daysim and Mesh to RAD problem", "id": "topic_1593374"}
