{"body": "\nHello All,\n\n\n\nI was following Mostapha's sunshades tutorial on youtube. The shades designers seems to work if the sun shades are horizontal but when I toggle to vertical sun shades the sunshades move away from the surface and project far from the project. I have attached an images of both the results I get from rhino and a png of the grasshopper script.\u00a0\n\nI am not sure why it is doing this but if someone has any insight I would greatly appreciate it!\n\n\n\nThank you!!\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1587728", "name": "Capture.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1587729", "name": "Grasshopper_Sunshades.png"}], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "August 24, 2016 at 09:07AM", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "topic": "Ladybug Sunshades", "id": "topic_1587730"}
