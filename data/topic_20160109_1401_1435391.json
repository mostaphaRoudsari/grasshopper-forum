{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI discovered something that doesn't make sense to me. I was messing around with the Number of CPU's for an annual daylight simulation, and I found that 8 CPU's took longer to calculate than 4 CPU's. This doesn't make sense to me. I tried closing out of rhino and grasshopper and opening it up. When I opened grasshopper, I selected my weather file, and it took about 1-2 minutes to calculate. This is what I found weird. When I calculated it again, with the same number of CPU's, it took much longer to calculate (~20-30 minutes). This is worrisome for me because I am using Ladybug/Honeybee for my grad project to optimize daylight delivery in a space. Therefore, I will be doing thousands of simulations.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is there a way to keep the calculations to 1-2 minutes? Why did I experience this phenomena?\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have uploaded the grasshopper file and rhino file.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nGeof\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1435389", "name": "Parameteric Model.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1435390", "name": "SOO Model.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Geof Wright", "created_at": "January 09, 2016 at 02:01PM", "created_by": "GeofWright", "topic": "Variance in Calculation times", "id": "topic_1435391"}
