{"body": "\nJoao,\n\nIt seems that the default auto-calculation of the distance from the blinds center plane to the glass was resulting in the blinds being closer to the glass than E+ likes. \u00a0It was only affecting cases where you have angled shades and the component is doing trigonometry to figure out how close the blinds could be to the glass without touching. \u00a0I just re-wrote the code so that, now you cannot have the blinds closer to the glass than half of the blind slat depth, which seems to be the limit of what E+ will tolerate.\n\nAlso, E+ does not like it when you input blinds that are perfectly at 90 degrees so I changed the component to automatically write out shades at 89 degrees when you connect up 90.\n\nUsing the Shade geometry as context worked perfectly for me and I am not sure what was wrong in your situation.\n\nSee your working file attached.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1574651", "name": "EnergyAnalysisMultipleZones2_CWM2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 1, 2016 at 3:35pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1573958", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1574649"}
