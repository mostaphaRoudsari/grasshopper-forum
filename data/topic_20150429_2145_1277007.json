{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI recently started to go into more detailed energy simulations with HB due to a project. I had a question (in a long line of questions to come I'm sure :( ) about the natural ventilation component.\n\n\n\nI apologize if this is quite trivial. In the natural ventilation type, there is an option for mechanical (fan-driven) ventilation (which is what interests me atm). The tooltip requests a design flow rate for the area. Is this done through the \"Set EP Zone Loads\" component and the ventilationperArea option? And what would happen (i.e what would be the default option) if I simply input a ventilationperArea without using the NV component?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 29, 2015 at 09:45PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Natural Ventilation Component", "id": "topic_1277007"}
