{"body": "\nIt can be different but that as Abraham said it won't change the value of DF.\n\nDF is the ratio of the indoor illuminance to the outdoor horizontal illuminance under overcast sky. If the value of the sky changes the amount of light at the point will also change but the ratio (DF) will stay the same. (10000 to 200 or 20000 to 400 have the same ratio)\n\nIf you want to calculate lux values under overcast sky, you can use CIE sky component and generate an overcast sky and set-up a grid-based analysis.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 7, 2015 at 6:38am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416438", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416283"}
