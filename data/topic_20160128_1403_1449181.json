{"body": "\nHi All!\n\n\n\nThis program was working completely fine yesterday, but it is having issues running the read annual result component for DA, UDI, etc for daylighting.\n\n\n\nI have a feeling this may only be from my computer, but having restarted it and refreshing everything, it is having glitchy issues.\n\n\n\nIs there a chance there is something wrong with the coding, or anything I might be missing?\n\n\n\nKind Regards\n\nElly\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1449180", "name": "Workflow_Forum.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 28, 2016 at 02:03PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Problems running Honeybee_Read Annual Result I - ds_el_lighting.exe stopped working", "id": "topic_1449181"}
