{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI have tried to run an energy simulation using the \"honeybee_export to open studio\" component, it works when i use energy files downloaded from the e+ website but i have troubles when using energy files downloaded elsewhere, the component returns the message (1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: ** Severe ** No Location given. Must have location information for simulation.)\n\nDoes anyone have been trough this problem before? how can it be solved?\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1539775", "name": "PTHP Open studio export 31.05.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1539776", "name": "BRA_Santa.Maria.839360_SWERA.ddy"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1539777", "name": "BRA_Santa.Maria.839360_SWERA.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Virg\u00ednia Vannini", "created_at": "May 31, 2016 at 2:17pm", "created_by": "VirginiaVannini", "topic": "\"honeybee_export to open studio\" Energy file location problem", "id": "topic_1539778"}
