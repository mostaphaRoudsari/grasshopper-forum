{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\n\n\nFirst I'd like to thank Mostapha, Chris, Mingbo and everyone who made LB+HB in general, and the last release in particular, available to us all.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have a specific question related to HDR images, output from Radiance (or not necessarily in my case, but processed using Radiance/pcomb).\n\n\n\nHas anyone tried to apply bespoke or unusual gradient palettes to their false-colour images ?\n\nIt would be so great to be able to process images like grids, using a preset library much like this:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/resources/g...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/resources/gradients.jpg)\n\n\n\nI used to use the 5 available palettes described in A. Jacob's Radiance Cookbook (+ bespoke ones) on the command line with the old falsecolor.pl , but I don't think these are available now with falsecolor2.exe... am I right?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ez1i6iyJXXM2L17h4BYiwawNh8Z1q37dkJjoZdCdBM1MUih6hVmKz9IDDZVr0ywqaczvRudrpAfKfC189gzIxaYuL21NycZ9/fc_pal.JPG\" width=\"448\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ez1i6iyJXXM2L17h4BYiwawNh8Z1q37dkJjoZdCdBM1MUih6hVmKz9IDDZVr0ywqaczvRudrpAfKfC189gzIxaYuL21NycZ9/fc_pal.JPG)\n\nI am aware of the alternative old palette -spec but in the current HB false-colour component, but is that it ?\n\n\n\nAnother question for Mingbo - I get the following error message when trying to open the attached HDR file with your amazing new viewer:\u00a01. Solution exception:Parameter is not valid.\n\nAm I doing anything wrong ? I can see many useful applications to your pixel-value reader, especially if externally rendered HDR images can be loaded (which is the case here). Do they need a specific header to be \"valid\" ?\n\n\n\nMany thanks in advance for your help.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nJocelyn\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1791992", "name": "test.hdr"}], "created_by_name": "Jocelyn Urvoy", "created_at": "August 1, 2017 at 10:07am", "created_by": "JocelynUrvoy", "topic": "Processing HDR images / falsecolor2 palettes & the new image viewer", "id": "topic_1791993"}
