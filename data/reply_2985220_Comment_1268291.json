{"body": "\nHitoki,\n\nThe function that is generating the comfort polygon on the psychrometric chart component is the\u00a0ASHRAE 55 PMV model, which is the same as the one used in Climate Consultant. \u00a0If the two polygons are not aligning exactly, it is probably because the 4 PMV parameters other than air temp and humidity are different between the Ladybug Psych chart and Climate Consultant (including radiant temp, wind speed, metabolic rate, and clothing level). \u00a0Check these values on the first window of Climate consultant and make sure that you are inputting the same ones into the Psych Chart component.\n\nIf you want an ASHRAE 55 reference that will align more easily with the Ladybug Psych chart by default, I translated the code for the Ladybug PMV model from the open source CBE Comfort tool ([http://smap.cbe.berkeley.edu/comforttool](http://smap.cbe.berkeley.edu/comforttool)).\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 21, 2015 at 12:01am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1267473", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1268291"}
