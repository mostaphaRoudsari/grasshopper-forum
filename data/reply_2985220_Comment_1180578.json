{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Sangyong,\n\nYou need to download more than just OpenStudioTemplate. I'm sorry that downloading process is broken right now. In the new version I added better warnings. Try to follow this instruction and then let the Honeybee fly again. Then try again and it should be all fine. Let me know if it didn't solve the issue.\n\nIf you are experiencing any issues with downloading gendaymtx, OpenStudio libraries and other Ladybug and Honeybee files, you can download all the files from this link as a .zip file and manually extract it to Ladybug folder: ([https://app.box.com/s/bh9sbpgajdtmmystv3n4](https://app.box.com/s/bh9sbpgajdtmmystv3n4)).\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/E6-J*b1OZQNBtTaSA3kYA2ewgPl6XjGBtPPN1DFr6sGQegB8g*jtT5NhZSZd9PomumShRAF3ji1W90FBgF8MuhWG1e-lOz6m/ladybug_defaultFolder.png\" width=\"603\"/>](http://api.ning.com/files/E6-J*b1OZQNBtTaSA3kYA2ewgPl6XjGBtPPN1DFr6sGQegB8g*jtT5NhZSZd9PomumShRAF3ji1W90FBgF8MuhWG1e-lOz6m/ladybug_defaultFolder.png)\n\nYou can find ladybug default folder by checking the output of Ladybug_Ladybug component. It should be c:\\ladybug or C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug depending on your user permissions.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 3, 2014 at 7:05pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1180438", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1180578"}
