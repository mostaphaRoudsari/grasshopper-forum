{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI have set illuminance levels for my blinds state (100-2000 lux) of my two SH groups. When the analysis is done and sensor points have been defined I check the annual shading profile. Results say that the shading systems are open for all the year.\n\nI tried to do the annual study with the conceptual shading component and it works quite better giving me back an acceptable result.\n\nAnyway I see that the electrical lighting power consumption is oddly low.\n\nWhat mistake I'm not seeing?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nClaudio\n\nIf it can be useful *.ill files etc are here:\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13141514/annual_study.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13141514/annual_study.zip)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1077641", "name": "hall_annual_study_00.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "May 24, 2014 at 4:57pm", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "topic": "Daysim shading setting in annual study", "id": "topic_1077642"}
