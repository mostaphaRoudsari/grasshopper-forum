{"body": "\nBao,\n\nYou should compare a comfort study with solar adjusted temperature and no context shading to a study with solar adjusted temperature WITH context shading. \u00a0Right now you are comparing the context shading case to one with no solar adjusted MRT (which means that this case is always completely shaded). \u00a0With a Chicago weather file, I am getting that the solar adjusted case with shade is more comfortable than having full shade but your climate is really hot and so it would make sense that a fully shaded case is the more comfortable.\n\nRemember that the shade benefit component is only showing you the places where shade is more desirable. It does not show you an 'optimal case' unless you put a full sphere around the person and take all cells with shade desirability.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 3, 2016 at 2:12pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1453551", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1454131"}
