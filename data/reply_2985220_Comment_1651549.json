{"body": "\nSaba,\n\nI figured out what is happening. \u00a0There is a slight difference between your epw file and Abraham's file. \u00a0Specifically, it seems that your epw might have been opened in excel (or another tabular software) and re-saved as a csv, thereby adding a few extra commas onto the end of one line:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pM70oMcIKzMpKXY*HHVh21Oysg0SOPq*79hc4B5pnJrhAefpr9bZUi04ceQMcrKsEIeLXJpzXu4xRd0r6CvCqw3fMMAyAktM/CommasInEPW.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pM70oMcIKzMpKXY*HHVh21Oysg0SOPq*79hc4B5pnJrhAefpr9bZUi04ceQMcrKsEIeLXJpzXu4xRd0r6CvCqw3fMMAyAktM/CommasInEPW.JPG)\n\nI have [fixed the OpenStudio component](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/c54e4b5137fe584b99de6704ec24284afc8b595f)\u00a0such that it can now handle this type of EPW and you can find attached a GH file that manages to write the IDF and OpenStudio model. \u00a0However, because of some other things wrong with your EPW file, EnergyPlus throws an error about it when it tires to run the simulation. \u00a0I'm sorry that I can't completely solve your problem but at least you get the right error now and you know that something needs to be corrected in your epw now.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1651550", "name": "BaomailHouseA101.12.16_CWM.GH"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 4, 2016 at 7:03am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1651434", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1651549"}
