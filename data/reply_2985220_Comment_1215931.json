{"body": "\nCesar,\n\nMy guess is that you have chosen a day in your weather file that does not have good wind. \u00a0Maybe you should look at the differences over a longer period.\n\nAlso, your window area is still relatively small in comparison to the size of your whole building and this might be another reason why the flow is not so good. \u00a0You may want to try fan-forced natural ventilation (change the ventilation type to 3). \u00a0This will help you understand what flow rates you will need to get the temperatures that you want. \u00a0With fan driven ventilation, I image that you will get much better air flow.\n\nLastly, you should keep in mind that you are using a radiative temperature map to compare between cases when natural ventilation will probably change the air temperature much more than it changes the radiant temperature. \u00a0Even though it's one zone, I would use the color zone based on EP result for visual comparison (coloring the zone with the air temperature).\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 2, 2015 at 4:14pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1216018", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1215931"}
