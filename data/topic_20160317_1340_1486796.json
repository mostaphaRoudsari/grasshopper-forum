{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if there is a way to set up an electrochromic glass shading group for an annual daylight simulation. Right now I have two separate rad materials that define the two states I'd like my glass to be in. My issue is I don't know how to set them as two separate shading states to put them into the shading recipe.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nJohn\n\n\n\nEdit:\u00a0\n\n\n\nI figured it out.
