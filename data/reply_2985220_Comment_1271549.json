{"body": "\nHey Chris,\u00a0\n\nWhat is the difference between using the \"EP ContextSrf\" component, and using the \"Honeybee_CreateHBSrfs\" and setting the 'srfType' parameter to 6 (Shading)? \u00a0I tried the \"Honeybee_CreateHBSrfs\" method with 'srfType' as 6\u00a0and consistently got errors that the surface Normal Direction was not expected for a Shading element, its thought to be a wall or a roof, depending if its a vertical shading element or a horizontal shading element.\n\nThanks for your help. Patrick\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Patrick Keeney", "created_at": "April 23, 2015 at 2:40pm", "created_by": "PatrickKeeney", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1543777", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1271549"}
