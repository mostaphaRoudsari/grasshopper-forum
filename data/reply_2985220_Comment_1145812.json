{"body": "\nHi Tom,\n\nYou can start from Rhino or Grasshopper and it doesn't really matter as far as you are\u00a0\n\nYou have couple of options on how to prepare the geometry and it really depends on what you want to do.\n\nThe general concept is that you need to convert a Rhino/Grasshopper object to a Honeybee object. You can assign your custom materials and apply it to the geometries or just let Honeybee apply default materials based on the type.\n\nYou can also put several recipes that you can also put together (Daylight factor, gridBased, imageBased, AnnualAnalysis, etc...)\n\nIf you have an example it will be easier to help. Also I suggest you to watch this video from minute 22 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4MA82_CPPA&amp;list=UUX0holrRypJil...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4MA82_CPPA&amp;list=UUX0holrRypJilkFo-Dv4JsQ)). As far as I remember I cover these concepts.\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 8, 2014 at 9:42pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1145360", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1145812"}
