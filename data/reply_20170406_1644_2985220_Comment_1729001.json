{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI'm digging through the GH/Ladybug discussions and came across Mathias's question, which is exactly the question I wanted to ask. Is there a way in Ladybug (rather than Honeybee) to output the peak solar irradiation values on each analysis point on a surface rather than the annual cumulative solar irradiation? The cumulative value is great for understanding PV output, for example, but for early phase facade design, having this visual of peak solar reduction from shading devices, for example, is a very useful capability. If you have any further thoughts on this, I'd be keen to hear them. This was one calculation that was quite straightforward in Ecotect, so I'm hoping it's not too difficult to implement in Ladybug if it hasn't been done so already. (Sorry, I don't have a GH file to share!)\n\nThanks!\n\nIrene\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pau Martin", "created_at": "April 06, 2017 at 04:44PM", "created_by": "29znrrp0u4jsd", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1356872", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1729001"}
