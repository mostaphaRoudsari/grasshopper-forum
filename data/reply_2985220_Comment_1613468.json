{"body": "\nHi Djordje,\u00a0<br/><br/>no worries at all, sorry for my explanations that were not very clear.\n\nI want to generate both the whole island (that I will bake) and parts of the island based on their location. Both things are possible with your component.\n\nI was only wondering if it would be possible not to download the .tif data for the different parts of the island I want to generate each time. But instead, use the .tif of the whole island (since already downloaded) and use your component like a \"split\" component.<br/><br/><br/>\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aymeric Delmas", "created_at": "October 7, 2016 at 12:04pm", "created_by": "AymericDelmas", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1613722", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1613468"}
