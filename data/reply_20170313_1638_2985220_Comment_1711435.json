{"body": "\nSo, here is a quick fix. The idea is to take an existing epw file and replace the desired datasets and location info. Below are some images as proof of concept. The first sun path contains data from the original epw file. The next one contains your dataset. The dataset to be replaced needs to be contained in a csv file as attached. You can replace more data from the original file by addiing additional columns in that CSV and assiging the correct column number in the grasshopper file. The ordering of columns in an EPW file is shown in the last image. For example, Direct-Normal rad is column -21 and Diff-Horz rad is -20. All of this will be clearer once you check the attached gh file.:\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/9e-LbPNbsUtuq5zG5Udn2J*hdYetFOYbAol4Bx*GzlSr1zsyXSUMwXK0WWZdYnvJfpccQtBESMlUE9Ni-9fiDi825Z19tZrv/original.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/9e-LbPNbsUtuq5zG5Udn2J*hdYetFOYbAol4Bx*GzlSr1zsyXSUMwXK0WWZdYnvJfpccQtBESMlUE9Ni-9fiDi825Z19tZrv/original.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/9e-LbPNbsUvfulUL*OYKtAVCklds0qE4ynLbDvs1KQGJhT4t3qJUCBHX7uaH7xxaL2zMIa4AgBDfHN*ODLmNTz03C*1Hnezw/replaced.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/9e-LbPNbsUvfulUL*OYKtAVCklds0qE4ynLbDvs1KQGJhT4t3qJUCBHX7uaH7xxaL2zMIa4AgBDfHN*ODLmNTz03C*1Hnezw/replaced.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/9e-LbPNbsUuVs7NoHT3x-eYBISMb5qw9Wq2o8yV3u6qefhjnWMEKtLKw3fISGxXtOqaT-hq2gi7rbmfDkNvA114s*pjHIRe9/313201750452PM.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/9e-LbPNbsUuVs7NoHT3x-eYBISMb5qw9Wq2o8yV3u6qefhjnWMEKtLKw3fISGxXtOqaT-hq2gi7rbmfDkNvA114s*pjHIRe9/313201750452PM.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, that theory about diffuse radiation being 10-40% of direct does not really hold. In a place like Seattle, one can expect to go without seeing the sun for extended periods of time and only see visible radiation from the sky.\n\n\n\n(PS: I am sure there are probably more elegant ways to do this..I just wrote it this way to check if it was at all possible to do this with grasshopper).\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1711436", "name": "weatherDataReplace.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1711437", "name": "weatherFile.csv"}], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "March 13, 2017 at 04:38PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1711093", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1711435"}
