{"body": "\nSarith,<br/><br/>The project is in Indonesia so yes near the equator.<br/><br/>The geometry is constrained for the tip of roof's overhang to be cut by a 45 degree inclinated plane starting from the groundfloor's contour. <br/>This is an arbitrary angle that I have inputed to protect the building elements from weathering effects (prolonged hour of solar exposure and wind-driven rain).<br/><br/>As this condition constrains the geometry very much, I am trying to define the threshold at which the size of the overhang is to be considered and still have good daylight on the first floor.<br/>Which I narrow down to glare issues. After doing fieldwork in such a building in Indonesia, I have noticed that glare was caused by the slightest view of the sky due to the high humidity, regardless of the orientation; or due to direct sun radiation on the east and west early morning or late afternoon.<br/><br/>this is the reason why I was thinking of assessing with the Vertical Sky Component. <br/>I am now running DA with a 3000 lux threshold, with 0 bounce, thanks to you. The area above should indicate the fitness of my optimisation.<br/><br/>Would you have read a discussion on weathering effects with LB/HB? Is there a way to input the wind driven rain intrusion somehow?<br/><br/>Kind Regards,<br/>Olivier<br/><br/><br/>\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Olivier Dambron", "created_at": "September 2, 2016 at 10:27am", "created_by": "OlivierDambron", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1592453", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1592617"}
