{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor a sample .csv you can \u00a0click on the \"save selection to file\" button as seen on the screenshot of Mostapha above and in the DE page. For the rest you need to follow the structure you follow with Pollination. If you manage DE to work properly \u00a0with images and .json files that you have connected please let me know since the links do not work for me.\n\n\n\nBest\n\n-Tasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 08:31AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448097", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448261"}
