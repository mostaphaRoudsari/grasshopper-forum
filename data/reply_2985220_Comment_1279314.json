{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nYes I have been using dir but mostly for horizontal surfaces (to properly set up floor and ceiling) but never on horizontal. Yes you are right, in the error output it was mentioned that \"EP is trying to automatically fix\" so I guess it should be ok. I'll try a 2 zone model perhaps and see if there is any difference in the energy simulation results.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 8:30pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279081", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279314"}
