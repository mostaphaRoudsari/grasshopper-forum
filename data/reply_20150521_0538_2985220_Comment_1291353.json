{"body": "\nAlso downloaded the latest OpenStudio version and then copy/pasted the CSharp openstudio folder to Ladybug folder. Still getting the same error. The way I understand it there is an old version that won't have this problem. I would love it if you could tell me which and if I can follow the same process (i.e. installing Openstudio and copy/pasting) to downgrade to.\n\n\n\nCheers!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 21, 2015 at 05:38AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1291342", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1291353"}
