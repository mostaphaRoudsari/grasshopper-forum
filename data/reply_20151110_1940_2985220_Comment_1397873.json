{"body": "\nGreat work Djordje!\n\n\n\nI had a problem regarding the optimum tilt and azimuth angle. I tried to run the same simulation as the figure in the description (Portland, OR) but something is wrong with the results. Even when I changed the weather file to any location in the northern hemisphere, the optimum tilt and orientation are 45 and 180 respectively. Is it possible to attach your .gh file in the example folder?\n\nAnother issue would be the same as discussed in the previous replies. Adding more than one PV surface will cause a problem of overlapping between the different shading diagrams.\n\nOther than that, the components are very handy and helpful!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "MARWAN ABUJBARA", "created_at": "November 10, 2015 at 07:40PM", "created_by": "MARWANABUGABBARA", "parent_id": "topic_1309523", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1397873"}
