{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI am trying to get a cumulative sky matrix for the whole year with only clear skies, is it possible to do with ladybug/honeybee?\n\nThe purpose of this is to be able to find the solar position that produces the peak solar heat gains in a specific room. For that purpose I cannot use a typical weather data file.\n\nThe alternative would be to buy a meteonorm license to get a weather file with only clear skies, but first I wanted to check if it was possible to solve this within LB/HB.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nAle\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "May 2, 2016 at 8:30am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Create cumulative sky matrix with only clear skies", "id": "topic_1520658"}
