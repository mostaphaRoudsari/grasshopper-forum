{"body": "Hi Chris!\nThank you for replying me (and djordje!)\nAnd thank you for developing the PET recipe component. Now I can finally evaluate better the PET and create the outdoor microclimate map that I need for my thesis without using the Thermal Comfort Indices Component.\n\nRegarding the Urban Weather Generator issue, I think that for the moment, in order to generate the weather files I need for the urban simulations and analysis, I will try to use other tools that the guys of the department where I am working for my thesis are more used to. Maybe in the next days, since I'm starting to set up my work only in the Rhino/Grasshopper environment, I will also try to use Dragonfly. Anyway I will let you know and I will update you about my progresses!\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Scarpati", "created_at": "May 17, 2016 at 04:02PM", "created_by": "FrancescoScarpati", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1531661", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1532162"}
