{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for the reply. It's good to know this will be usefull and implemented (:)) There's no rush ofc, I can start testing this out with the additional parameters. It's good to know where to look for this.\n\n\n\nDo you think this might also change something on the downstream, i.e. visualization/result assessment components or is it not that big of an impact? I am thinking something like visualizing scenarios of different daylight zones and energy consumption. I am guessing all this can be done with the re-color mesh just wondering if this merits some special treatment.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "October 01, 2016 at 08:25PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1609319", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1609249"}
