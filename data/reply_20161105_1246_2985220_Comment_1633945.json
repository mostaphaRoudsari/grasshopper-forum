{"body": "\nHello Abraham!\n\n\n\nSorry for the late response. As i mentioned before, I have tested to increase the\u00a0width and height in the\u00a0\u00a0imagebased component. It seems to be disfunctional, at least for me. I tried it once again, \"reloading\" the component (Latest version of Honeybee) and adding the resolution of 1000 to both width and height. Any other ideas? Anyone?\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1633947", "name": "HoneybeeImageresolution.png"}], "created_by_name": "Afshin Ghafoori", "created_at": "November 05, 2016 at 12:46PM", "created_by": "AfshinGhafoori", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1607729", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1633945"}
