{"body": "\nHi, Guys!\n\nI tried to run an outdoor airflow simulation with Butterfly. My GH file was created based on the case file, and the case file could run correctly on my computer. When I run my GH file, several iterations were calculated and the Rhino crashed.\u00a0\n\nIf the size of my model is too big to be calculated? Any advice will be appreciated.\n\nRoy\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1813132", "name": "teachingbuilding.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Yi LUO", "created_at": "September 13, 2017 at 08:55AM", "created_by": "YiLUO", "topic": "Rhino will crash when running the outdoor airflow simulation with BF", "id": "topic_1813133"}
