{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI checked a bit more thoroughly. This happens with both conditioned and unconditioned models.\n\nI'm attaching the unconditioned example (needs the 3dm also. Sorry for not internalising).\n\nDisable the solver before opening. It can take a while to run.\n\nAlso attached the IDF files created by each component. The differences are minimal ... if any, so i can't explain the differences.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1610774", "name": "munot o - A1_Clean.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1610775", "name": "E+.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1610776", "name": "munot o - A1 - 15.09.16 - ASHRAE-EU_AY_Updt.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 04, 2016 at 01:51PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1610476", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1610772"}
