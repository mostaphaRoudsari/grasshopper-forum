{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if a correlation between daylight and cooling energy can be established using the dynamic shading recipe since the daysim components use illuminance values (in lux) as triggers and E+ takes radiation (W/m2) as trigger. I mean even if I take out a lighting schedule from UDI analysis, it will be difficult to get the corresponding change in my cooling energy use. Any thoughts on this? Please let me know if I have not made myself clear.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nRam\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ram Joshi", "created_at": "September 2, 2016 at 3:11am", "created_by": "RamJoshi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1392123", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1592185"}
