{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI know that this is something that the new version of the Ladybug Analysis Tools API is going to handle but I was wondering if there is anything that can be done till then.\n\n\n\nThe idea is to have a way to use OS measures for the creation of quick reports (and perhaps certification templates) out of our models directly in GH. I have to admit I am not entirely sure if this isn't already available in HB. I am guessing it is possible to currently export the .osm, run the measure and get the report, but it would be cool to do it within GH especially with the visualization capabilities in GH/LB/HB.\n\n\n\nAnyways, just dropping the idea of a post-processing tab/component that can use these and new OS measures to play with simulation outputs. See what people think.\n\n\n\nP.S.: The current list can be found here I believe [https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site/?f](https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site/?f)[0]=bundle%3Anrel_measure&amp;f[1]=im_field_measure_tags%3A959\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "October 16, 2016 at 01:59AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "OpenStudio Measures: Reports", "id": "topic_1619419"}
