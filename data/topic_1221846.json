{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI just started working with the new version of Honeybee and I noticed that the heating and cooling results from EnergyPlus are not the same as those obtained with the previous version of Honeybee. I am not modeling an HVAC system, only the default Ideal Loads Air System.\n\n\n\nI'm wondering if anyone might be able to tell me\u00a0what the major changes have been between the old and new versions of the EnergyPlus components in\u00a0Honeybee that have caused the heating and cooling\u00a0results to change.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nLindsay\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lindsay", "created_at": "February 10, 2015 at 1:05pm", "created_by": "Lindsay", "topic": "Honeybee EnergyPlus Heating and Cooling Results", "id": "topic_1221846"}
