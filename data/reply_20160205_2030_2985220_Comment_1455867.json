{"body": "\nThanks Antonello for creating this component. It's great! I have a small suggestion for the component inputs. I suggest to change the input from AnalysisPeriod to DOYs. User can input values between 1-356. In this case user can match the number of inputs for days to number of output values. As you probably know Ladybug has a component to calculate DOY for any date.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 05, 2016 at 08:30PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1452037", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455867"}
