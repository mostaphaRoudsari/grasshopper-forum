{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and team,\n\n\n\nFirst of, thanks for a lovely suite as always.\n\n\n\nI have problems however with the temporary folder for skyFilePaths on the genCumSky, as it creates it in my user folder on the computer. My user name in this firm is \"users/firstname.surname\". But it looks like the gridBasedSimulation is clipping the path at \"users/firstname\", so it cant find the temporary skyFile.\n\n\n\nAny chance to add a custom path, so I can store the temporary skies in C:\\temp \u00a0etc ?\n\n\n\nRunning version 0.0.59\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1580464", "name": "1.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1580465", "name": "2.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Mathias s n", "created_at": "August 12, 2016 at 12:47AM", "created_by": "Mathiassn", "topic": "custom skyFilePath", "id": "topic_1580466"}
