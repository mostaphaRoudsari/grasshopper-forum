{"body": "\nThank you both!\n\nTheodoros, that is the expected behavior. It is happening because you probably have another file with an older version of Ladybug or Honeybee open which overwrites the newer version. Anytime that you see this warning, you can disable/enable ladybug_ladybug and honeybee_honeybee components. This will overwrite the older version. Now if you try again the components will run fine.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 04, 2015 at 04:47AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1216893", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1217016"}
