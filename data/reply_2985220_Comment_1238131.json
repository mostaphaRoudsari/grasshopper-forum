{"body": "\nDimitrios,\n\nThe\u00a0shadeNetEffect is in\u00a0kWh/m2 of shade and it gives you results on a cell-by-cell basis of each test shade.\n\nThe\u00a0energySavedByShade is in kWh and is on a per-shade basis.\n\nI have changed the description of these outputs to incorporate the units.\n\nNote that you should take these values with a grain of salt as the energy savings are only computed by looking at the solar gains for the hours when you are cooling and they do not incorporate the effects of complex things such as thermal lag or accurately account for diffuse radiation. \u00a0To understand exactly what your energy savings are from a given shade, you should take the Brep of the shade that you get from the Shade Creator, make it HBContext and re-run the energy simulation with the shade. \u00a0Thus, the energy savings numbers that you get from the shade creator are more of a guideline, giving you a relative sense of the savings as shading size changes, rather than a final result.\n\nLegends with\u00a0Degree-Day/meters2 only happen when you use the \"Comfort Shade Benefit Evaluator\" rather than the \"Energy Shade Benefit Evaluator.\"\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 6, 2015 at 9:50am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1235817", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1238131"}
