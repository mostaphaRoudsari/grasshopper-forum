{"body": "\nI since learned that using the OpenStudio system, \"Packaged VAV w/ Reheat\", is seems to be possible to successfully hardsize the airrate and cooling supply air temperature to control the resulting draftrate.\n\nHowever it would be very usefull,\u00a0for engineering purposes, to have more knowledge available on the OS systems\u00a0including what is hardcoded in the HB components in relation to BigLadder's EnergyPlus documentation, and on adding systems using additionalStrings.\n\nI have very limited\u00a0experience with E+ and\u00a0really hope you can make sense of this post?\n\nAlso I ask the developers if you know of any validation work, BESTTEST etc., regarding the whole workflow of writing the input file from HB, to running E+ and reading the results in GH?\n\nThanks again\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jon Strunge", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 09:26AM", "created_by": "JonStrunge", "parent_id": "topic_1727350", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749167"}
