{"body": "\nBut actually I still have a doubt:\n\nhow GH or the component WRun all the iterations\" knows when is the time to change the value of one of the sliders? This can happen only when the running simulation is over, so to start another, so does it know when the simulation is over? Or it happens automatically that the value inside the slider is not changed yet untill what it produce (next simulation) can run?\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "April 24, 2015 at 05:01AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1271945", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1272024"}
