{"body": "\nThe reason why you got\u00a0[that error](http://api.ning.com/files/XLG*RRSSnGNZypo7S4U4JL2-r4zPpCG9D5VkqJNlh-v-WyqEY1Pg8QYQhe07ygeqVR9XFWt7e53Jv-z5b3Ncnq2gI9f*qNXQ/3.png?width=721) when you plugged the Eground to the **Monthly bar chart** component is due to bug inside the **Monthly bar chart** component.<br/>The first branch of the Eground data tree consists of ground-reflected values for tilt = 0.<br/>The PV_SWH_surface can not \"see\" beyond its plane, therefor a surface parallel to the ground does not receive any ground-reflected radiation. So all values are 0.<br/>It would be useful to inform the user that the annual hourly values supplied to the _inputData are all zeros, instead of raising an error.<br/>I will report this to component's author.<br/><br/><br/>Are you trying to plot the total monthly values of beam, diffuse and ground-reflected, and total solar radiation?<br/>For example in January the beam component was 100 kWh/m2 total (the summation of each hourly value in January).<br/>In February the beam component was 120 kWh/m2 total, and so on...<br/>Because right now with Monthly bar chart component you are plotting values for each hour during a year separated into months.\n\nand If I use just azimuth =180 degrees and different values for tilt angle, the results for annual solar radiation (2074 kwh/m2) will be the same as values that calculated for each azimuth and tilt angle?\n\n<br/>I didn't understand you this. Can you clarify please.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 23, 2016 at 02:56AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570277", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570206"}
