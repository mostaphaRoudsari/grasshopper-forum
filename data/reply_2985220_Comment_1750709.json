{"body": "\nI haven't been able to find my model in the Rhino views, it only returns when I end the simulation.\u00a0<br/><br/>Furthermore I tried to keep on the simulation and got something out of it! But I would like the Legend to be visible as well, which I can not. Any solutions to how I can?\u00a0<br/>I have attached a screenshot, of how it looks like, when I have set the component to preview.\u00a0<br/><br/>Thank you!\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1751110", "name": "Udklip 2.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Christoffer Thor Paulsen", "created_at": "May 13, 2017 at 2:30pm", "created_by": "ChristofferThorPaulsen", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1750898", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1750709"}
