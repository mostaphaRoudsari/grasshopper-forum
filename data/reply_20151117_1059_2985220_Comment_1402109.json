{"body": "\nHi Ludvig,\n\n\n\n1) The calculations in this component use the E+ PV generator object. Seen here\u00a0[http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-4/input-output-reference/gr...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-4/input-output-reference/group-electric-load-center-generator.html#generatorphotovoltaic). While the Ladybug components are based on the NREL PV watts calculator.\n\n\n\nYou can see how the calculations are conducted here:\u00a0[http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-4/engineering-reference/pho...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-4/engineering-reference/photovoltaic-arrays.html#mathematical-description)\n\n\n\n2) I just realized that I overlooked this when I created the component. Are you going to use this model? Do you need me to integrate it into the component for you?\n\n\n\n3) It seems that my example file wasn't uploaded to Hydra I will upload it shortly.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "November 17, 2015 at 10:59AM", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1402075", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1402109"}
