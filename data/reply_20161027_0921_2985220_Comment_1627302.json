{"body": "\nHi djordje,\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply and your kind words!\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Pietro,\n\n<br/>I have took a look at your file, and I think it is possible to export colored meshes like yours to Google Earth. Give me a couple of days and I come back to you with a clear solution.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2ZCXgQMgG8xO3uZwW7kiDDeCHbN8BffWqGHhF2ln*TmHxRl3Wd-Ue*-xza5jNuFd4gg306cSSaWrI3geoNzs-UNyZpW5HM4I/GE_A.png?width=450\" width=\"450\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2ZCXgQMgG8xO3uZwW7kiDDeCHbN8BffWqGHhF2ln*TmHxRl3Wd-Ue*-xza5jNuFd4gg306cSSaWrI3geoNzs-UNyZpW5HM4I/GE_A.png)\n\n\n\nExample with two buildings (Ladybug_KMZ +\u00a0Vicente Soler's script)\n\n\n\nThanks for your test, the error you see is because I'm using a method that projects buildings on the terrain by using their centroids, thus if a building or a geometry is outside the terrain area the component doesn't find projected point onto terrain, I should add a warning for that.<br/>However, I think that the main question is that you should translate data from \"vertex colors\" into \"textures\", and this is something you can do neither with LB_Kmz nor GHowl. here you can find a clever solution made by Vicente Soler:<br/>[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/how-to-render-mesh-colors](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/how-to-render-mesh-colors)\n\nIn the meantime I suggest you try to arrange meshes and export one or two building at a time because Google Earth crashes if you export all your geometries at once.\n\n\n\nBest<br/>Antonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "October 27, 2016 at 09:21AM", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "topic_1626009", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1627302"}
