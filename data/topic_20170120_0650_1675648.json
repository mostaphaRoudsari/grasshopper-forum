{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am quite new to HB and have an issue to model ventilation that is demand controlled.\n\nIn the HBSetSchedule component is written for the ventilation schedule :\n\n**\"Note that this schedule overrides the typical ventilation that occurs based on the occupancy shcedule and the \"ventilationPerPerson.\"**\n\nSo I guessed if we didn't put a schedule there and specify a minimum airlow/m2 and minimum airflow/occupant, EP would calculate the volume flow rate at each timestep based on the schedule, but it doesn't seem to work.<br/> <br/> Indeed, on the results, I only have a constant airflow that correspond to the maximum of vol/m2 and vol/occ. So I wonder how to use these components to have demand controlled ventilation.\n\nWhat I really want is have a minimum airflow when the room is not occupied and a bigger one based on the number of occupants when the room is occupied.<br/> <br/> I currently have :\n\noutdoorAirRequirement input = 1 (maximum) in SetEPZoneThreshold\n\nventilation per area = 0.00035\n\nventilation per occ = 0.01 in set EPZoneLoads\n\nNo ventilation schedules input in SetEPZoneSchedules\n\n\n\nHope you can help,\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\nAurelien\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aurelien Keller", "created_at": "January 20, 2017 at 06:50AM", "created_by": "AurelienKeller", "topic": "Demand-controlled ventilation issue", "id": "topic_1675648"}
