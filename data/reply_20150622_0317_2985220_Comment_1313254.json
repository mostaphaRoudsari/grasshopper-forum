{"body": "\nIf anyone is concerned about strictly following ASHRAE, you can easily calculate average monthly temperature for a climate with the Ladybug_AverageData component and simply not use the adaptive model for those months. \u00a0Alternatively, you can use only the adaptive model in early design for your own sanity of not switching between comfort models and, if you have to later show code compliance, I have found that you can almost always get the hours that use the wintertime adaptive correlations to work with the PMV model by playing around with the clothing and metabolic rates.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHey Chris, I agree with you and I can see your logic and I like your approach. My only suggestion would be to have a check for the input data and give a warning to the user if you are using the alternate method.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 22, 2015 at 03:17AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1313320", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1313254"}
