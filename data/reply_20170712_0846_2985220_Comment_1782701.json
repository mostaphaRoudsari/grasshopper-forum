{"body": "\nHi Sarith,\n\n\n\nThanks for your response. Unfortunately the massing I'm working on is confidential so I'm unable to share that, but please find attached a Rhino file and GH canvas demonstrating the same issue. I'm baking the coloured mesh onto the Rhino model but it's not appearing when rendering. I'm sure it's probably something basic but I'm not as literate as I'd like to be.\n\n\n\nIf you wouldn't mind answering another question too: do you have the same issue with the analysis hanging and never completing when you reduce the grid size down to less than 0.25m? A 0.5m grid completes in less than a minute on my machine, but a 0.1m grid was left overnight and just hogged 90% of my RAM and never completed. I wonder if it's something fundamentally wrong with my canvas or whether I just don't have enough computer.. what's strange is after a few minutes the processor use drops down to &lt;5% but the memory use stays up at 90%+ no matter how long it's left.\n\n\n\nThanks very much for your help, I really appreciate it and I apologise as I realise my questions are probably trivial compared to what you are used to answering.\n\n\n\nWigg\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1782702", "name": "Basic Dense Massing.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1782703", "name": "20170303-Radiation Analysis + Shading-v1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "T Wigg", "created_at": "July 12, 2017 at 08:46AM", "created_by": "TWigg", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1783042", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1782701"}
