{"body": "\nhello Abraham,\n\nso I tested it and I think it works for simulations the component that run all the iterations, so thank you very much. I have just one question: do the component work also with a boolean toggle? Or only with the click button? Because with the click button first you have to wait that the first simulation is completed then you can start the run all the iterations component. If this works also with the boolean toggle then with just one boolean toggle is possible to start everything (the daylight analysis component and the run all the iterations component) so it is not necessary to wait that the first simulation is completed.\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "May 4, 2015 at 1:30am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1273874", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279833"}
