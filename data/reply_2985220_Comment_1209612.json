{"body": "\nHi Luciano,\n\nThank you for posting.\n\nUnfortunately Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) is the one comfort metric that Ladybug does not currently calculate. \u00a0For outdoor comfort, I usually suggest that people use universal thermal climate index (UTCI) and the \"Outdoor Comfort Calculator\" component will calculate this for you.\n\nStill, I know that both UTCI and PET form the current gold standard for outdoor comfort, depending on whether you have information on clothing and metabolic rate (when you would use PET) or prefer to have these variables adapted with the change in outdoor conditions (when you would use UTCI).\n\nTo be honest, the reason why I have been slower to integrate PET is because it seems very similar in principle to Outdoor Standard Effective Temperature (OUT_SET) and you can already calculate OUT_SET with the PMV comfort calculator. \u00a0I will also admit that I had more trouble finding documentation on how to calculate PET and its merits over OUT_SET. \u00a0Needless to say, if anyone on the forum knows of a good reference that explains how to calculate PET, I would be happy to take a look at it and pull together a means of calculating PET in Ladybug.\n\nI also know that the Ladybug developer Djordje Spasic has a lot of interest in the issue and there's a good chance that he is ahead of me on this. In case this is relevant to your study, his \"Thermal Comfort Indices\" component will calculate a number of different metrics - from wind chill to humidity index.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 22, 2015 at 3:02pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1208688", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209612"}
