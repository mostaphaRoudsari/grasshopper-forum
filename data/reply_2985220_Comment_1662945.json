{"body": "\nDevang,\n\n\n\nWhat's troubling me is that when I select 9 floors and run, it doesn't work but when I select 3 of them pair by pair and run, it works.\n\nRight now I am managing that way only. Saving the results bit by bit.\n\nThe total number of data points for the tower are around 150,000. I guess its too much for gh/lb to handle at once.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHi Abraham,\n\nThere were memory issues a couple of times but in those cases rhino pops up a dialogue box saying out of memory and it will close after that. The machine is pretty tough (intel Xenon, 500SSD, 32GB RAM, 4GB nvidia quadro).\n\nRight now the cpu usage during the heavy overall analysis goes up to 95% sometimes but memory usage stays between 8-9 GB. CPU usage does crank up to max I guess. How to solve it? Any ideas?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saket Sarupria", "created_at": "December 26, 2016 at 4:24am", "created_by": "SaketSarupria", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1662942", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1662945"}
