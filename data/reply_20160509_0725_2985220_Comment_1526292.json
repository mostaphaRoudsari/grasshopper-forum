{"body": "\nHi Mohamed,\n\n\n\nI wish we could make that happen but there is not that much that we can do about this.\n\n\n\nThis is something that David needs to change in how Grasshopper locates components. Ladybug components are userobjects and are created from a single Python component. Currently when you press CTRL+ALT + LMB\u00a0Grasshopper identifies them as GHPython components but it can potentially check for Component.SubCategory.\n\n\n\nThe best solution for now is to open the editor and check ghenv.Component.SubCategory\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/jACL*2XH9YkxzD9Fg*xqOLdarPeSnhnMXOZ3n02l299OclojGCmke1pEYZ*OO1oZQkA5ke1abD2uckypiFV4mpCzNkTiu-ps/Subcategory.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/jACL*2XH9YkxzD9Fg*xqOLdarPeSnhnMXOZ3n02l299OclojGCmke1pEYZ*OO1oZQkA5ke1abD2uckypiFV4mpCzNkTiu-ps/Subcategory.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 09, 2016 at 07:25AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1526093", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1526292"}
