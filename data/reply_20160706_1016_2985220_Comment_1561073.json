{"body": "\nHi Erik,<br/><br/>Both of your issues deal with component's output previews.<br/><br/>To display the isocurve in the Tilt And Orientation Factor component, just turn on the preview of the whole component.<br/><br/>Displaying quadrantShadingPercents can be done in two ways:<br/>a) less visually appealing - in Grasshopper. It requires hiding of \"sunWindowMesh\" output and plugging the \"Text tag\" component to the particular outputs.<br/><br/>b) more visually appealing ([the example](http://api.ning.com/files/Z3BWMoplk5SKli5hVB7-9WdIvC1qAnTs4LdiOxOoi5lYNsNMY6Pziuk0mXUcOCMa*Ledz0Sb4XY6n3BjseCTWQTz60LAe0UZ/photovoltaics_shading.jpg) that you can see in the initial reply of this topic) - just bake the component's results (set the \"bakeIt_\" input to True).<br/><br/>I attached a\u00a0[.gh file in here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vzvr9mpo5lpj11r/Ladybug_Photovoltaics_TOF_results_preview.gh?dl=0) which replicates the upper suggestions.\n\n<br/>Also it's a bit tricky to answer your questions without your .gh and .3dm files. I understand that you are using the [Ladybug Photovoltaics Sample files](https://app.box.com/s/zmnybht71kv21fxynn6k9hawj51fq5ok), but sometimes users change something which affects the final result.<br/>For any future questions I would be grateful if you could attach your .gh and .3dm files (in case you are using .3dm files). Thank you.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 06, 2016 at 10:16AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1561125", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1561073"}
