{"body": "There are many different ways this can be approached. It also depends upon which qualities of light measurement you wish to use as a control. As a starting point, I recommend establishing an ideal daylight factor or illuminamce value that you desire during hours of operation. Then set up a honeybee recipe that can measure the light value during the desired period. You could use something rather standard from LEED or Illuminating Engineering Society.\n\nFrom there create parametric geometry of a wall and opening of glass in Grasshopper, assuming your geometry is rather simple. Allow the opening to be variable with slider inputs. Then use a genetic algoritihm component, such as galapogas or octopus, to find and identify the ideal geometry.\n\nOnce working, you can then likely introduce an additional aspect of energy measurement and route that into the genetic algoritihm as an equally weighted value.\n\nThis would enable you to generate daylight value maximized (most often periods it hits a bench mark) with least amount of thermal energy needed.\n\nGeneral comment, but I believe provides some good seeds for proceeding based on experience.", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dustin Altschul", "created_at": "March 10, 2016 at 09:13AM", "created_by": "DustinAltschul", "parent_id": "topic_1481422", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1481340"}
