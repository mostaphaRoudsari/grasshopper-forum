{"body": "Maria,\n\n\nIs this error occurring with the geometry that comes with the example file or you own geometry? If it is your own geometry, please upload your GH file so that we can replicate the error.\n\nIf it is the geometry that comes with the example, what service release of Rhino are you using? If it's an early one, this might be a bug in Rhino.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 09, 2016 at 05:06PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1479477", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1480777"}
