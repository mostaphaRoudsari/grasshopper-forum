{"body": "\nI don't know if this is currently possible with HB or not, but if you don't mind roughing it out on the commandline, it is totally doable with Radiance. Use [Gendaylit](https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/gendaylit.pdf) with the -02 option to create a climate based sky, and then use that sky to do a radiation analysis with ambient calculations turned off (i.e. a -ab 0 run).\n\nDaysim approximates the position of the sun, which can be in as many as unique 3000 locations on an annual basis, [to only 65 odd locations in the sky](http://daysim.ning.com/subprogram/rtracedc). GencumulativeSky, which is used for the cumulative studies in the Hydra examples, [takes the annual radiation data and creates a Tregenza Sky pattern ...](http://www.solemma.net/references/PLEA2004_RobinsonAndStone.pdf). While a Tregenza pattern might be fine for an annual simulation, using it for hourly simulations isn't going to be very accurate.\n\nThere are actually some thermal comfort examples on the Hydra website that you might find useful.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 09, 2017 at 07:57AM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1745345", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1748263"}
