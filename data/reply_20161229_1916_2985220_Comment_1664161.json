{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, I'll be back in a day or two. In the meantime I'll leave this updated definition of my attempt. Looks like the simulation took off but the results were not what I expected (I expected the surface temperatures to vary depending on the melting point of the PCM but they didn't, i.e. exactly the same values were popping up even with different melting points). I definitely went wrong somewhere.
