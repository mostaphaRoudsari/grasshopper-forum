{"body": "\nHi!\n\nWhile working on the dynamic shading simulation, after a few tests I found the annual simulation with dynamic shading cannot generate .ill files.\n\nI ran 2 tests, one with shade of Trans material, which works fine, another with shade of BSDF material (other settings remain the same), it will not generate ill file, but there is no error shown in any honeybee component either. I took a screenshot as below:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/jd6gI2obRb5sSsysSw0S0twx3BW5RgOb1TiJ9dij0FGcJz-LYZCO4h74jYilVWdFjwF3KE9clO8Wnt2UlIOeYqSlimeVmSoN/Capture.JPG\" width=\"660\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/jd6gI2obRb5sSsysSw0S0twx3BW5RgOb1TiJ9dij0FGcJz-LYZCO4h74jYilVWdFjwF3KE9clO8Wnt2UlIOeYqSlimeVmSoN/Capture.JPG)\n\nUnknown type BSDF. I tested this BSDF material I used in this simulation in a simple box for annual/point-in-time simulation, which works fine. But I also attached the xml file to this post.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny suggestions/previous experience with BSDF dynamic shading would be much appreciated! Thanks!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nXF\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1716947", "name": "2011-SA28.XML"}], "created_by_name": "XF", "created_at": "March 20, 2017 at 4:23pm", "created_by": "XF", "topic": "Honeybee Dynamic Shading with BSDF Material", "id": "topic_1716948"}
