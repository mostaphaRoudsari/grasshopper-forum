{"body": "\nChris thank you so much for following up with me.\n\nI'm going to quickly throw this out there and say that you and the whole HB/LB community are pretty amazing for putting all this together. I study industrial design but am interning at an MEP engineering firm this semester. On the first day they asked me, \"you know rhino right?\" and I say yes and they're response was okay learn HB and LB for us because none of us know rhino. I've almost got them on board with our grant program to cover the cost of the web series you guys release through performance network.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'm going to work through your response with the engineer assigned to the project and if anything else arises I'll reach out again. Thanks again for your help.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack", "created_at": "October 31, 2016 at 10:42am", "created_by": "ZackSickman", "parent_id": "topic_1627899", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1629493"}
