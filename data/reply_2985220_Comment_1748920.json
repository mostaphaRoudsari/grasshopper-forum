{"body": "\nChris,\n\nIndeed at some point I directly referenced the microclimatemap to the E+ results file to save time. I took a number of actions (deleted folder with generated files, updated HB,LB, reloaded grasshopper, deleted and added new microclimatemap component) and the problem persists. Meanwhile, surface temps are mapped in the correct order. <br/>As a side note, an earlier version of the posted gh def. could run the component although the model was technically full of errors (eg: Building masses were not intersected). It also returned the same result when grid resolution was set at precisely 1m which is also weird.<br/><br/>I will also attempt the approach suggested by Abraham. Assuming that the internal spaces are always conditioned and we are only interested in the external wall heat balance, one could theoretically create one superzone and subdivide the surfaces of interest near the pedestrian level. This way the surface temp. results can also inform a CFD analysis using butterfly.<br/><br/>Aris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aris V", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 2:51am", "created_by": "ArisVartholomaios", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1748383", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1748920"}
