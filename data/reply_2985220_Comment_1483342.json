{"body": "\nHey Ataur,\n\n\n\nmy question would be - do you really need an annual simulation?\n\nWhat is really the goal of the testing?\n\n\n\nI don't know your project exactly but what I would do is following:\n\n\n\nDepending on the location of the project and the target of the testing I would choose a beginning sky+day.\n\n\n\nEasiest ist to begin with just overcast sky or even diffuse sky - the day does not matter that much - would probably choose some day in June or so.\n\nThe outcome of this - you get a rough estimation of daylight levels + distribution of your system under that sky. I guess one could pick a few winners at the end of the study\u00a0 and then proceed to test these winners under more extreme conditions.\n\nI would probably thest somewhere in March, June and December - blue sky with sun.\n\n\n\nSo that would be my workflow for a general project here in Europe. Here overcast sky is present most of the year.\n\n\n\nHope it helped\n\n\n\nThomas\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Lechner", "created_at": "March 12, 2016 at 11:55pm", "created_by": "ThomasLechner", "parent_id": "topic_1483233", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1483342"}
