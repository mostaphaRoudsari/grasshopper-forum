{"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\n\n\nI think you can do it by using the colortext primitive in Radiance. You can locate the text from the pts file that Honeybee generates, assign a directional vector based on the view specification and assign color as per the illuminance value. (This is most likely what they did above anyway...)\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe other approach is to generate an equally sized jpg/bmp/tiff with numbers alone, then do a reverse conversion to HDR and finally combine the two images with pcomb.\n\n\n\nI just don't think it is worth the effort as even in the image above, the numbers in the end are completely obscured. I prefer the mesh thingy that we already have :)\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "August 8, 2016 at 4:07pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578722", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578822"}
