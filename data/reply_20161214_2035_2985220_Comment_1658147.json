{"body": "\nHi Benny,\n\n\n\nThe way I see it, there are two issues you need to resolve. There are open and invalid breps in your workflow. Please see attached 01. It is strongly advised that the HbZones shall be a closed volume. That's not happening still. see attached 02. The adjacent surfaces should be similar, otherwise, the adjacency\u00a0calculation will give an error. This needs to be addressed to. All in all, you still need to take a good look at how your geometry is being supplied to Run Energy Simulation\u00a0component.\n\n\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1658148", "name": "01.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1658149", "name": "02.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1658150", "name": "03.png"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "December 14, 2016 at 08:35PM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1657949", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1658147"}
