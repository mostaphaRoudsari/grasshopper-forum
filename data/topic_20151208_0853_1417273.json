{"body": "\nHi Dear all,\n\nI have a question about creating occupancy file using occupancy generator component.\u00a0The case I am working on is a school dinning hall, thus the occupied hours are three separate hours per day, at 10 12 and 15, also summer and winter holidays should be considered. To set up this occupancy file, the component was plugged in shown in the screenshot. However, the generated csv file doesn't give me what I expected, occupancy written as 0 in days from January to June.\n\nCould someone tell me a way to solve it?\n\nI could generate two csv files by plugging in only one analysis period each time and manually sew them in excel, but I am sure there is better than that.\n\nThank you!\n\nXue\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UpexccZZ4rQmVutcmCINK33jt-f9m4DSyO-sUVo7OxufA*u56C9K4*-E4bZbqW9MXYq82rEni8x9k78FmDAa3sK6dgBqTP61/Skrmbild_120815_044815_PM.jpg\" width=\"661\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UpexccZZ4rQmVutcmCINK33jt-f9m4DSyO-sUVo7OxufA*u56C9K4*-E4bZbqW9MXYq82rEni8x9k78FmDAa3sK6dgBqTP61/Skrmbild_120815_044815_PM.jpg)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Xueting", "created_at": "December 08, 2015 at 08:53AM", "created_by": "Xueting", "topic": "question about Daysim occupancy generator component", "id": "topic_1417273"}
