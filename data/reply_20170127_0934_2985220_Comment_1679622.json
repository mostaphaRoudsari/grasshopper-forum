{"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\n\n\nI may be saying a huge stupidity, but if there is no other option... may it be worthy to take like 4 epws of the closest places that you can find and create your own file using the interpolation algorithms that meteonorm uses for the same problem? It will never be exact but... don't know, better than nothing\n\n\n\nHaving a quick look I didn't find the exact algorithms, but these 2 articles may help you\n\n\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan_Remund/publication/2414913...](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan_Remund/publication/241491372_Quality_of_Meteonorm_Version_60/links/0f31753282b4a2400c000000.pdf)\n\n[http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BSO2016/p1059.pdf](http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BSO2016/p1059.pdf)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julia T", "created_at": "January 27, 2017 at 09:34AM", "created_by": "JuliaT", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1679269", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1679622"}
