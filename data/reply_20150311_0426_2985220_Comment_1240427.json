{"body": "\nThanks Chris,\n\nThis is not the problem, but good that you clarified the definition.\n\nI'm still having the same problem as above. So what i did is to bang windows and shades to pick just one of them each time. It works this way. So i assume there is a problem in the script when there is more than one element to analyze.\n\n... Checking a bit further, the problem is with the amount of windows. It only accepts one, which thinking about it, has a logic of its own. No warning with the amount of shades.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 11, 2015 at 04:26AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240079", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240427"}
