{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI'm trying to relate the UK guidelines on sunlight hours to the Ladybug sunlight hours analysis.\n\nIn particular I would compare the result of **\"Ladybug_Sunlight Hours Analysis\"** with an APSH (Annual Probable Sunlight Hours) benchmark that is set in the **\"BRE_Site Playout Planning for Daylight &amp; Sunlight (2011)\":**\n\n**<br/>**APSH is defined as **\"the long-term average of the total number of hours during a year in which direct sunlight reaches the unobstructed ground (when clouds are taken in consideration)\"** and for London is 1484 (while the total daylight hours are\u00a04383)\n\n\n\nNow, my question is: Does the output **- sunlightHoursResult -** of **\"Ladybug_Sunlight Hours Analysis\"** take in consideration clouds or the analysis considers the sky always sunny?\n\nIf not, can I get a result that takes in consideration clouds or there's a method to \"convert\" the result in order to compare it with the APSH value set by the guidelines?<br/><br/>\n\n@[Dimitrios Papadopoulos](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/doompop)\u00a0: Did you manage to sort this issue?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nJ[D]\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "J[D]", "created_at": "April 19, 2017 at 10:25AM", "created_by": "Giulio670", "parent_id": "topic_1044324", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1735865"}
