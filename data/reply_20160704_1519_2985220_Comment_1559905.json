{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nthanks for looking into this, really appreciated. I wonder what you mean, though- the cooling setpoint is above the heating setpoint in the file. That should not trigger coincident operation, no? Unless my brain is totally borked (maybe).\n\ncoolingSetPt [Optional]<br/>A number or list of numbers that represent the thermostat cooling setpoint in degrees Celcius. The cooling setpoint is effectively the indoor temperature above which the cooling system is turned on.\n\n\n\nheatingSetPt [Optional]<br/>A number or list of numbers that represent the thermostat heating setpoint in degrees Celcius. The heating setpoint is effectively the indoor temperature below which the heating system is turned on. This can be either a single number to be applied to all connected zones or a list of numbers for each different zone.\n\nI'll upload the simple boxes definition tomorrow- or you will have convinced me by then that my logic is wrong! :)\n\nBest,\n\nMax\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Max D", "created_at": "July 04, 2016 at 03:19PM", "created_by": "ButWhyprecisely", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559802", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559905"}
