{"body": "\nI see that from radiation analysis component I get a list of values with no tree structure, when I would like to have lists of values separated by which face it is on. But I understand this may not be possible because the geometry input is meshed and joined.\n\n\n\nTrue. If you put breps as input then the data will be branched but once the input is a joined mesh it will be flatten. You can use unflatten component to branch them out based on your meshing pattern.\n\n\n\nBack to RAM issues there are couple of things that could be considered, and\u00a0implemented. One of the solutions is exactly what you mentioned. The other one is to de-activate undo for the component. I assume that Grasshopper/Rhino keeps the data for undo in the RAM (I haven't tested this and I can be wrong but this is my understanding.)- Finally I might be able to delete some of the data after assigning them to outputs. RadiationAnalysis component is literally one of the first codes I have ever written in Python and it is a mess so if I want to edit it probably I would re-write it from scratch.\n\np.s. do you know or use the pv watts website ? I havent looked into all the honeybee components yet but I remember using pv watts a lot when I was calculating on site solar energy potential. that plus 40 year period rain data for sizing the roof + water cirsterns.\n\n\n\nI like what pvwatts provides but for development purpose I'm looking forward to integrate NREL's System Advisor Model (SAM) to Ladybug at some point. It does provide similar data and in my opinion it is even more advanced. It also has an API which makes it much more desirable.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 19, 2014 at 04:23PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1171338", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1171980"}
