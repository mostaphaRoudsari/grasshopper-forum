{"body": "\nHi Mostapha.\n\nI am sorry to trouble you again. I am using 'annual daylight simulation' component to analysis annual glare of multiple zones. As you told me that glare is view based. And I also connected multiple points to the 'set the view' component to set the views. But when i analysis the glare of two zones, the list of the result i got is three. The more than three zones, the result is also three lists. Is it because i don't set multiple names to the 'the Rhino views name' of the 'DS Parameter' component. I don't know why this problem occur. And don't know what to do whit this. Can you give me some suggestions.\n\nBest regards!\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hang Chen", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 2:52am", "created_by": "HangChen", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1446043", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448215"}
