{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\n\n\nIt was just too difficult to test anything with your file but I was able to\u00a0 replicate the issue with a smaller model and simpler GH file.\u00a0 I got the OpenStudio component giving far worse comfort than the E+ component even though the average temperatures were similar:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/99aVnO*4LGeX4QOTPc-*hFkR8XNwvStEJeBmfes0BEjnchs8LEgFmUOv4y82jbYMBDAibiyU2nQgcISi0wks78Gb13cFvagg/DifferentAdaptComf.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/99aVnO*4LGeX4QOTPc-*hFkR8XNwvStEJeBmfes0BEjnchs8LEgFmUOv4y82jbYMBDAibiyU2nQgcISi0wks78Gb13cFvagg/DifferentAdaptComf.JPG)\n\n\n\nIt turns out that it was not the known difference in ideal air system between the components (swapping out the ideal air template into the OpenStudio file did not affect the results).\u00a0 Rather, it was a bug in the OpenStudio component that was causing incorrect default constructions to be written for some of the surfaces.\u00a0 I think your case wasn't affected as much because you are overriding a lot of the default constructions.\u00a0 I fixed this bug here:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/6b185b5c8b7d9b1...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/6b185b5c8b7d9b1ed5aad381852c16c473dc6308)\n\nAnd I now get results that match very closely.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/99aVnO*4LGcieSMrwTMtfukpPWqNfxNi8GfQmX2nhqK0oLqugswCHZuSBmhLodzNve27h0OmyE7vsRs5tBikLKvphz0w53Q4/ComfResultsMatching.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/99aVnO*4LGcieSMrwTMtfukpPWqNfxNi8GfQmX2nhqK0oLqugswCHZuSBmhLodzNve27h0OmyE7vsRs5tBikLKvphz0w53Q4/ComfResultsMatching.JPG)\n\n\n\nLet me know if updating your components fixes your issue, Abraham.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 7, 2016 at 3:32pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1610855", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1613747"}
