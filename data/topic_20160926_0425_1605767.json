{"body": "\nHello!\n\n\n\nIm having trouble understanding how to manage the resolution of a imagebased rendering in ladybug. I have tried to change the width and height in the imagebased component but\u00a0I seem to get the same resolution with a larger viewport (it is not changing the image quality, only the image size) The same happens when i try to change the viewport in rhino and set the imagebased resolution to 0.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions on how to increase the quality of an rendering (imagebased simulation)\u00a0in ladybug?\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1605765", "name": "Imagebasedrendering.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1605766", "name": "Imagebasedrendering.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Afshin Ghafoori", "created_at": "September 26, 2016 at 04:25AM", "created_by": "AfshinGhafoori", "topic": "Changing the resolution (Image quality) of imagebased simulation - Ladybug", "id": "topic_1605767"}
