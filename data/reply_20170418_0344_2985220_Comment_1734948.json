{"body": "\nOF is letting you know that the points file, one of the files created by blockMesh by default, is not in your constant folder. Usually that would mean your blockMesh either failed or was not run successfully.\n\n\n\nIn this case I feel that what is happening is the case is trying to run in parallel without being decomposed (smh). At least that is what the \"rm: cannot remove `proc*': No such file or directory\" indicates in the error log.\n\n\n\nEchoing mostapha try running it without decomposing and see if that works. If it does, clean the case and start the process again, step by step, while taking a look at the folders generated inside your case folder.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 18, 2017 at 03:44AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1733906", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1734948"}
