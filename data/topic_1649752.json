{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI've been noticing that the HB_IndoorViewFactor's viewFactorMesh output changes the mesh of the original HBZones. In the following image we can see that the zones BEFORE the viewFactor have some geometry and AFTER they are different. At the top the zones before (each zone with a different color). At the bottom after. There are 3 zones changed.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure this is producing \"wrong\" calculations for the different comfort models and so, but wanted to bring this to your knowledge and response.\n\nThere are other cases that we get less meshes/zones than those in the input.\n\nAny words of wisdom?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/noNLDbauUJDWqBq0eYrjE5z6RbelpJkUhNt9e4G9iyf2NGpya2aXh0ZJkyt1mh6K93E1Qc78NyBnPoOePjSGSsPwcK13BV-E/Capture1.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/noNLDbauUJDWqBq0eYrjE5z6RbelpJkUhNt9e4G9iyf2NGpya2aXh0ZJkyt1mh6K93E1Qc78NyBnPoOePjSGSsPwcK13BV-E/Capture1.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 1, 2016 at 2:13am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "HBZones before and after HB_IndoorViewFactor - Differences", "id": "topic_1649752"}
