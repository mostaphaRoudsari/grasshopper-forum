{"body": "\nSorry for being late! As mentioned by everyone else DF is the same regardless of the time and or orientation. As you can see in this image overcast/cloudy sky is symmetrical:\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t31.0-8/1899568_738349506177905_814150566_o.jpg\"/>](https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t31.0-8/1899568_738349506177905_814150566_o.jpg)\n\n\n\nAlso DF is the result of dividing sky horizontal illuminance to the illuminance that the point receives which means if you change the value of the sky the value of light on the test point will change but the relationship and so the daylight factor stays the same. Here is the source code for the sky that Honeybee uses for DF calculation:\u00a0[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeyb...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeybee_Daylight%20Factor%20Simulation.py#L54-L83)\n\n\n\nI'm curios to know if changing the date and time in Dialux changes the value of DF. It should not. That would be an interesting study.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 5, 2016 at 10:18pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1452847", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455878"}
