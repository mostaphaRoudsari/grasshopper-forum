{"body": "\nI think I'm not understanding something about creating zones from surfaces. Aside from labeling my surfaces with duplicate names, I have errors at intersections. There are roughly 15 of these type of errors:\n\n\n\nWhen I made my surfaces, I created a separate surface at each intersection. For example, Wall A intersects Wall B and I created Wall C which represents the intersection of the zone. Wall C was assigned as its own surface in the assemblage of zones.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
