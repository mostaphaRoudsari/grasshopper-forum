Again in your case you're making a mistake by not connecting the vectors but regardless you can get slightly different results from radiance for each run, specially when radiance parameters are set to a low quality.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 30, 2017 at 5:57am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1723909", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1724068"}
