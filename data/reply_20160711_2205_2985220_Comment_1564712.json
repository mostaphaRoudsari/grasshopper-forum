{"body": "\nMax D,\n\nI ran your last box file and I did not get the same result as you. \u00a0Everything seems to be making sense on my machine:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/nHqVmaeEGUG0i470q6BLrDJFlNP*Ax4FCuylnn6TJVq88pZZKz2HGHiSoFdy1j5FzDIov06cS5LTsrYePisFhgDVypgZNO59/WorkingComfortMap.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nHqVmaeEGUG0i470q6BLrDJFlNP*Ax4FCuylnn6TJVq88pZZKz2HGHiSoFdy1j5FzDIov06cS5LTsrYePisFhgDVypgZNO59/WorkingComfortMap.JPG)\n\n\n\nThis is with the midrise apartment program. \u00a0My guess is that it does not have to do with this shcedule but something else related to the matching of the data to surfaces by name. \u00a0Let me know if you are able to get it to come up again. \u00a0Generally, I think that cleaning up your GH file will help you error find the error or just get rid of it.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 11, 2016 at 10:05PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1563908", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1564712"}
