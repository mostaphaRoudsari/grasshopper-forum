{"body": "\nHi Priya,\n\n\n\n1) The values being provided are string type (letters), I converted them to numbers. It\u00a0works now.\n\n2) I am not sure why this happens, but I am assuming you are trying to do this in order to create a custom list using your data. For that, you can use native grasshopper \"Replace Items\" component. I have used the same in the attached file. Please note how the value of drybulb temperature at index 8757 is replaced. You could use the similar logic to make a custom list. I also supplied the output of this process to psychchart component, it works.\n\n3) There are special functions embedded in Ladybug / Honeybee components to accept and parse output of EPW data. Therefore, if you intend to use EPW data, you should directly connect the outputs of import EPW data to the component where you wish to use them.\n\nI have turned the preview off from some of the psychcharts. To turn them, hover over their icon, right-click and click preview.\n\n\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1647808", "name": "psychChartProblems.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "November 28, 2016 at 10:50PM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "topic_1647926", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647806"}
