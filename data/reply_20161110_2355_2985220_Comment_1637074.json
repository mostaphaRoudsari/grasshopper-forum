{"body": "\nInterestingly enough, it looks like the component is working as intended.\n\nThis seems to be the reason why one shade won't work in this example:\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4P6PC2FXGK0Pq7SHhGC4237Tibf3HXOTb1Hc8xiDdNq0meMPjnbqN4mWzdPaDBI0UnQyBtPcbQ0Lv6hSChKQigA2Tfmi4as-/hbshade.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4P6PC2FXGK0Pq7SHhGC4237Tibf3HXOTb1Hc8xiDdNq0meMPjnbqN4mWzdPaDBI0UnQyBtPcbQ0Lv6hSChKQigA2Tfmi4as-/hbshade.JPG)\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeyb...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeybee_EnergyPlus%20Window%20Shade%20Generator.py#L898)\n\n\n\nBasically, Chris has added a check to see if the shadingHeight (the distance of the window to shade device) is greater then one meter, which then cancels the generation of the HBObject, to make sure it doesn't crash E+. I'm not sure why, it crashes E+, but I'll raise this as an issue on github, to see if this is, as it seems, an edge case that will never give us a HBObject, or if there's a way around this problem.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately I also don't have any solution for this, but here's a file where I've reduced your window height (therefore the shadingHeight) to less then one meter and the component works fine. Maybe that will be of some help in the meantime?\n\n\n\nS\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1637075", "name": "EnergyPlus_Window_Shade_Generatorversion60_AY_SV.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "November 10, 2016 at 11:55PM", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1637244", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1637074"}
