{"body": "\nhallo Mostapha\n\nhallo community,\n\nthis gh file works awesome, thx mostapha, but is there a way to keep the scale always the same. I am a testing a simple room with different windows openings. When i change the windows dimensions, the 3d result is always showing the same shape. How can i assign every single color to a specific result ( for instance df 1% is blue, 2% is yellow...etc) \u00a0so the scale of the 3d is changes accordingly?\n\n\n\nthx for any help!\n\n\n\nn.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1267176", "name": "window_small.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1267177", "name": "window_big.png"}], "created_by_name": "nass", "created_at": "April 19, 2015 at 9:27am", "created_by": "joe88", "parent_id": "topic_1045033", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1267174"}
