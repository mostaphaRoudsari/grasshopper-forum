{"body": "\nHi again ... and sorry for asking so much.\n\nI have another issue here. I'm changing the construction materials with the setEPZoneCnstr component (according to video 16, i think) (see point 4 in attached). So far so good. Simulation is fine.\n\nThe issue happens with the RadiantTempMap component when i connect the HB_Zones with the output of the setEPZoneCnstr component. Then i get the following message (see point 8 Bad):\n\n**1. For one of the meshes in the _viewFactorMesh, the number of faces in the mesh and test points in the _testPtsViewFactor do not match.**<br/>**This can sometimes happen when you have geometry created with one Rhino model tolerance and you generate a mesh off of it with a different tolerance.**<br/>**Try changing your Rhino model tolerance and seeing if it works.**\n\n\n\nWhen the connected zones coming from the output of point 3 in file it is OK.\n\n(You need the Custom file from my previous message).\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1151483", "name": "H_Bldg1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 19, 2014 at 07:42AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151719", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151482"}
