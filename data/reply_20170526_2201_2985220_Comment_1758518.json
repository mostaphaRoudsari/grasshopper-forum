{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI believe the problem is neither with Ladybug nor with the epw file. The TMY (Typical Meteorological Year) format used for most weather data files was developed by Sandia national library. The method is based on 12 years of measured data. Starting with January, January which is closest to the mean of twelve Januaries is selected based on a composite weighing of solar radiation, temperature, humidity and wind velocity. The same process is applied for the following months. So as a result, each TMY month most likely correspond to measured data from a different year. That is how the weather data file is composed. Due to this averaging, the data sometimes surprise the residents of that location.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "May 26, 2017 at 10:01PM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1758294", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1758518"}
