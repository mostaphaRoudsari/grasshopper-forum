{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am trying to run the GenCumulativeSkyMtx component and I was getting the error that the GenDayMtx.exe could not be downloaded. So I manually downloaded it and moved it to C:\\Users\\Kaley Blackstock\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug. Now it's telling me: Runtime error (FileNotFoundException): Could not find file... see attached error message.\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks.\n\n-Kaley\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/NDILiAzzLEXe8Di8CLYSlSUW*uznI-L72Uu6W50x2BXs9Kx0G2dRnm9o3LtPlyT-vv6MiA2K2I*TRWP2WXUrERlMfx5W*hOS/ladybug_skygenerationissue.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NDILiAzzLEXe8Di8CLYSlSUW*uznI-L72Uu6W50x2BXs9Kx0G2dRnm9o3LtPlyT-vv6MiA2K2I*TRWP2WXUrERlMfx5W*hOS/ladybug_skygenerationissue.JPG)[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NDILiAzzLEWabAhmJTRt1CcbUnRrBnfLoOYOfF2RF1kmpxpLZrddH*aImpKK4XGyBV3mxWf06MNKheD5-GxzsIZmV7tYyu5Z/ladybug_skygenerationissue.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kaley Blackstock", "created_at": "October 21, 2014 at 09:54AM", "created_by": "KaleyBlackstock", "topic": "GenDayMtx Error", "id": "topic_1153138"}
