{"body": "\nHi Sajad,\n\n\n\nIf you are talking about the validation of simulation engine Honeybee uses Radiance (and daysim for annual simulation). Radiance is a validated engine ([http://www.radiance-online.org/](http://www.radiance-online.org/)) and there are several publications that you can use as reference. Just google for Radinace daylight validation. Honeybee is just an interface.\n\n\n\nHaving said that, the validation and calibration of your model (i.e. is your inputs and assumptions vs the reality) is something that, as you mentioned, needs to be proved by measurement.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 12, 2015 at 11:49AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1419599", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1420161"}
