{"body": "\nHello,\n\nGreat news!!! So happy with that.\n\n\n\nOne thing, I don't know if its possible or how difficult would it be, so just asking.\n\nWould it be possible to make more clear the additional results from Energy plus?\n\nI'll try to explain my self.\n\nI've been spending a lot of time developing a way to use Air flow network directly\u00a0in grasshopper instead of\u00a0 running the simulation, editing the .idf and reloading it. I plug it in the\u00a0additional strings of the run energy simulation\u00a0and then I get the air flow volume (ach) from the\u00a0\"Other zone data\"\u00a0in \"Read result\" and the opening factors and multiplier of the windows from the\u00a0\"other surf data\"\u00a0in \"Read EPS Srf results\" all of them quite mixed, but its easy to separate them, so not a real problem with that.\n\nHowever, some other outputs that I'm also including, such as the wind pressure on the windows surfaces don't appear (or I haven't found), I need to get into the excel .\n\nIt would be quite helpful\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julia T", "created_at": "January 25, 2017 at 02:48AM", "created_by": "JuliaT", "parent_id": "topic_1677014", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1677965"}
