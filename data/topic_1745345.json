{"body": "\nI wonder if someone has found a way to determine maximum yearly irradiance for a calulation mesh in Ladybug? Using Daysim/Honeybee and \"Honeybee_Read All the Hourly Results from Annual Daylight Study\" takes way too much time (minutes) and requires lots of disk space. The method does not have to be very exact and does not have to include more that direct solar radiation (even if it would be nice to also get an approximation of the diffuse radiation).\n\n\n\n/Max\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Max Tillberg", "created_at": "May 4, 2017 at 3:02am", "created_by": "MaxTillberg", "topic": "Peak irradiance (solar radiation)", "id": "topic_1745345"}
