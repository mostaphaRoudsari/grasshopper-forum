{"body": "\nHi Mostapha\n\nI had a look at the gitHub code. I tried to fix it but couldn't get it to work. Are you able to take a look? If/when you update, are you just updating gitHub or are you creating a new version in foor4rhino?\n\n\n\nThe other thing that I would like to do (but can't), is for the sunlight hours analysis component to not join/weld the sunlightHoursMesh output. It would be great if they could be color coded based on all the faces (so legend applies to all meshes) but that separate colored meshes are returned. Otherwise its near impossible to split meshes in Grasshopper. Basically I have rooms (surfaces) and I want to know which rooms comply and which don't. I think to fix this, its the\u00a0\u2018ladybug_ResultVisualization\u2019 function?\n\n\n\nThanks for your help.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul Wintour", "created_at": "March 31, 2015 at 9:25pm", "created_by": "PaulWintour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1250858", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1253787"}
