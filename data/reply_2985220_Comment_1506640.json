{"body": "\nThe party is getting good :-)\n\nOne of the final outputs expected, by now, is having the pergola keeping the contour of the merged vectors.\n\nWe are working on this with Antonello and having good progress.\n\nSo i think that by now it is a good idea to keep going until we have a working version. Then we can merge it with the shadingDesigner ... or not, because we are also starting to work in a more general shading device calculator that i started to develop and this pergola thing can, maybe, be a part of it.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 11, 2016 at 11:20pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1506364", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1506640"}
