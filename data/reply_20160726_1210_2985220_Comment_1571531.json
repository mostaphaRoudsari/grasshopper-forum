{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThank you for the help, I updated the honeybee on git hub but its not working(the output results are same). I tried it in open studio but it is showing error. My model is ready for user study (not this one, it's a bigger file), I just need this one to work.\n\nI have attached my file. Could you look at my file? I will try open studio again!\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nVinu\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1571533", "name": "blinds.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "July 26, 2016 at 12:10PM", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571230", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571531"}
