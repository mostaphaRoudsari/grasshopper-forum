{"body": "\nHi Wim,\n\nSorry that I couldn't get back to you sooner. Let's get it fixed one by one. Can you please go ahead and download the new version. I updated the component not to give the warning for EnergyPlus. I will check the rest of your messages and reply shortly.\n\nTo update the components you should be able to use Honeybee_Update Honeybee to do it but as it looks like you can't copy files to C drive it may not work.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 14, 2014 at 8:41am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1025803", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1025804"}
