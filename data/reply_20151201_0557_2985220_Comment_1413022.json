{"body": "\nHello Boris,\n\nthank you for your reply. I know that it is not possible to make a component for every specific need people can have, don't worry I think you guys are already making a big work.\n\nAnyway I was not thinking to have two inputs one for the sun vectors and the other for the quantity of direct solar hours. I think, but this is just my case for the requirement I work usually, that would be interesting to have the possibility to work with a solar envelope in which the only input the quantity of direct sun hours. So no sun vectors at all. So the solar envelope should first run a sun light hours calculation (like the specific component does) to analyse every single facade then \u00a0considering the surrounding should then find the best solar envelope. I see this more a thing that it could maybe possible to achieve with the generative design tools.\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "December 01, 2015 at 05:57AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412726", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1413022"}
