{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI've been running two same environmental models of a simple box with one south facing window using Ladybug/Honeybee and another with IES Virtual Environment in order to fully understand the different features of the grasshopper plugin.\n\nComparing the results I have noticed a bug (or I'm completely missing out on something I've plugged in wrong).\n\n\n\nWhen comparing solar gains from one to the other I first noticed the results Honeybee were shifted by an hour (winter) or two (summer) compared to the IES ones, and that the results were shifted by 1 hour for the entire year compared to running the IDF file and EPW seperately in EnergyPlus. I have used the same weather file (Leuchars.epw) for each simulation.\n\n\n\nMy findings are resumed in the 4 graphs attached to this post.\n\n\n\nMy question is: why is this happening? I understand EnergyPlus/Honeybee are not accounting for daylight savings which is why the IES model is shifted an hour further during the summer, but why is the EPW processed through ladybug shifted one hour back?\n\n\n\nAlso, I managed to get similar solar gains by assuming a frame factor of 15% on my IES windows, what exactly is assumed in honeybee/energyplus regarding frame factors? And can it be changed using honeybee components?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1522189", "name": "Winter condition.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1522190", "name": "Summer condition.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Antoine Dao", "created_at": "May 04, 2016 at 08:16AM", "created_by": "AntoineDao", "topic": "EPW Weather misread + Solar gain issues", "id": "topic_1522191"}
