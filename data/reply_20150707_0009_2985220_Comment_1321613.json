Hot, warm, slightly warm, neutral, slightly cool, cool, cold. When they make their choice of expressions, I am predetermining the options and sending it to grasshopper/ladybug(like a schedule). I know I can do this option as each case but I am wondering whether I can program to run the simulation through all options or if you have any other way to go about it, could you let me know? I am not an expert at programming but I am learning.\u00a0\n\nThis is what I messaged Mostapha too and I have attached my research abstract to give you an overview of what I am doing.\u00a0\n\n<br/>Thank you Chris and Mostapha!\n\n<br/>Vinu\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1321614", "name": "lwlaAbstract.png"}], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "July 07, 2015 at 12:09AM", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1321190", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1321613"}
