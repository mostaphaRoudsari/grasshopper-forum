{"body": "\nHi Ahmad,\n\n\n\nTo add to what Chris mentioned, the spectral dispersion that we see with prisms require a full-spectrum continuous-band light source like daylight or light from an incandescent source. The x-axis in the image below are wavelengths.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/CIE_illuminants_D_and_blackbody_small.gif\"/>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/CIE_illuminants_D_and_blackbody_small.gif)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiance considers only three channels for calculation (RGB) that mostly corresponds to the Trichomatic Theory. In short, as Chris said, Radiance (and therefore Honeybee) will not be able to replicate light dispersion through a prismatic material.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 17, 2017 at 02:26PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1752950", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1753164"}
