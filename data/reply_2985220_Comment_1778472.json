{"body": "\nSandi,\n\n\n\nI could not open the file as the materials seem to be stored in a remote location. Regardless, I did some troubleshooting on your model and have a few suggestions:\n\n1. Radiance does not play well with path-names with spaces in them. So, I'd suggest getting rid of/modifiying all such instances in your materials and geometry files before starting.\n\n2. You need to have a local ground polygon in the scene to get accurate results. As per the model that I previewed, it does not seem to be the case.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8HnsNb3kvGiy9NRO1EYPPpWFOTtFMlvByJTlNPoBJG62thge3jhB-prjhX5SFZhLfZxwvbKrY1-MXH-zoPC0JFf2GTL5ZObk/Capture.PNG\" width=\"591\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/8HnsNb3kvGiy9NRO1EYPPpWFOTtFMlvByJTlNPoBJG62thge3jhB-prjhX5SFZhLfZxwvbKrY1-MXH-zoPC0JFf2GTL5ZObk/Capture.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. As I had mentioned previously, the order in which the materials file and geometry file are linked to the additionalRadFiles_ input is critical. In your case, the geometry file is specified to the materials file first.\n\n\n\nI expect things to work out once you address these issues.\n\n\n\nSarith\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "July 4, 2017 at 5:37pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1777758", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1778472"}
