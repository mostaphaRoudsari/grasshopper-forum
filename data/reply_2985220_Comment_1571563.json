{"body": "\nVinu,\n\nThanks for testing and reporting. \u00a0I took some time to go through your file and part of the issue was the result of a bug in Honeybee and part of it was because you were over-writing your CSV file and Energy Simulation Results by calling both IDF files and CSV schedules by the same file name.\n\nThe Honeybee bug is now fixed in both the EnergyPlus and OpneStudio components. \u00a0You can find your working gh file attached.\n\nThanks again,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1571564", "name": "FixedCSVSchedBugs.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 26, 2016 at 4:38pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571531", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571563"}
