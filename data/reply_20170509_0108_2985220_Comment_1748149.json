{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n...I meant better integration between Honeybee and Butterfly.\n\nIt was clear.\u00a0\n\nBack to acoustics we ended up not integrating it into Ladybug Tools. There were several reasons for it including that it needs a different set of skills that none of the current core developers have.\n\nOk, I understood.\n\nThe good news is that Arthur has started implementing Pachyderm functionalities to Grasshopper. Check his work here:\u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/pachyderm](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/pachyderm)\n\nYes, I know Pachyderm... Thank you.\n\n\n\nAll the best for your future development work.\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco", "created_at": "May 09, 2017 at 01:08AM", "created_by": "Francesco661", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1747475", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1748149"}
