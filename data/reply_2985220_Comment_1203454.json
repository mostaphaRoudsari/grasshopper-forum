{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nI'm sorry to finally respond to this issue so incredibly late. \u00a0I am still in the process of re-vamping the radiant temperature map component and working it into a big workflow to evaluate sub-zone comfort. \u00a0However, I am at a milestone now and I can rest and check your issue. \u00a0It seems that it was happening because of a naming convention that Mostapha was using for glazed surfaces that I have since fixed. \u00a0This was causing both the \"Color Surfaces\" component to not display the windows and the indoor MRT map to fail.\n\nNeedless to say, I put in all of the most recent versions of the components into your file, everything now works perfectly:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/*E1*lxSss-fWMw7PLF5xOKiigOm0LskVffqY9wqzI*tnkxkoyhzDooIf12Y6Uxy6KHz*nDWMvsdzf41UEYz-pP6GF6OLukzc/RadiantTemperatureMapFixed.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/*E1*lxSss-fWMw7PLF5xOKiigOm0LskVffqY9wqzI*tnkxkoyhzDooIf12Y6Uxy6KHz*nDWMvsdzf41UEYz-pP6GF6OLukzc/RadiantTemperatureMapFixed.PNG)\n\nLet me know if you run into any other issues and thanks for finding this one!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1203455", "name": "CaldwellTestOneZone_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 12, 2015 at 8:44pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1186302", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1203454"}
