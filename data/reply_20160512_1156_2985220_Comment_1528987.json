{"body": "\nHi Sarith\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply, I do understand that\u00a0theavrgTrans relates radiative energy to visible light (by humans) what I am trying to understand is how this is calculated within radiance.\n\n\n\nI am guessing that within the daysim code for daylighting simulations the same formula (0.265, 0.67 and 0.065) is used to convert the radiative energy transmitted through the glass into visible light.\n\n\n\nIs this correct?\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "May 12, 2016 at 11:56AM", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1528283", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1528987"}
