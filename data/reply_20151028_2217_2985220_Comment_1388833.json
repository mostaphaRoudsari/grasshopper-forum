{"body": "\nHi Elzine and Vinu,\n\nMy bad! I assumed that .bat files get created with setting write to True. I have modified the re-run Idf component and used it next to the component that I shared with you and was able to run 60 simulations with no problem on my laptop!\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4bIsJDjFjL7ZVkSw62wlUtMQOHf2vVm3XXMLhe3hGV6wtVwnZ3hpHf06YUXXmMQpJhtsRUs8qqL-egQDkIpm4J6wom3ZU42e/runMultipleIdfFiles.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4bIsJDjFjL7ZVkSw62wlUtMQOHf2vVm3XXMLhe3hGV6wtVwnZ3hpHf06YUXXmMQpJhtsRUs8qqL-egQDkIpm4J6wom3ZU42e/runMultipleIdfFiles.png)\n\nVinue, my guess is that your simulation failed since you're running the files in the same folder. EnergyPlus generates a number of files before running the study that will have the same name regardless of your file name. That can be the reason for the issue. The attached component creates a separate folder for each file and copies idf file and weather file inside the folder and writes the batch file.\n\nMostapha\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1388834", "name": "runMultipleIdfFiles.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 28, 2015 at 10:17PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1381777", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1388833"}
