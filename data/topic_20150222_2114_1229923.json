{"body": "\nI think there might be one or two bugs in the HB Set Ideal Air Loads Parameters component. \u00a0First, setting the airSideEconomizer boolean to True returns the following error:\n\n\n\n** Severe ** InitPurchasedAir: In ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem = ZONE1 IDEAL LOADS AIR SYSTEM<br/>** ~~~ ** There is outdoor air with economizer active but there is no limit on cooling air flow rate.<br/>** ~~~ ** Cooling Limit must be set to LimitFlowRate or LimitFlowRateAndCapacity, and Maximum Cooling Air Flow Rate must be set to a value or autosize.<br/>** ~~~ ** Simulation will proceed with no limit on outdoor air flow rate.\n\n\n\nWhen I set the IDF to LimitFlowRate and autosize, it ran without an error but the cooling energy use was the same as without.\n\n\n\nSecondly, I found that running the Ideal Loads System with or without the Economizer and/or Demand Control returned identical cooling energy use. \u00a0It was only when I went into the IDF file and input the Outside Air Method as \"None\" that the cooling energy went to zero.\n\n\n\nI discovered all this while trying to model a simple Ideal Loads System with no cooling, but I wasn't able to get results with no cooling energy straight out of HB. \u00a0I set the thermostat setpoint schedule to 40 degrees (using the CSV schedule of 8760 values of \"40\" that Chris suggested). \u00a0Any further help would be greatly appreciated. \u00a0I'm attaching the HB file I've been using for reference.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1229922", "name": "05_HVACIssues.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Burin", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 09:14PM", "created_by": "Burin", "topic": "Ideal Loads Outdoor Air Economizer", "id": "topic_1229923"}
