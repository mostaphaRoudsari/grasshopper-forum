{"body": "\nDavid,\n\n\u00a0\n\nepw files include tmy3 weather data\u00a0to approximate the local climate at every hour. DA is calculated by measuring\u00a0how much each unique skypatch contributes to the test point. Once this matrix is computed, Daysim creates a series of\u00a0unique hourly skies to match each hour in the analysis range. Each hour is based on the epw weather data, so the final result it is climate and location specific. You don't need to input the sky because Daysim creates them automatically.\u00a0Honeybee and DIVA both use the DAYSIM/Radiance calc engines, so the computation should be identical.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "February 1, 2016 at 7:23am", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "topic_1451504", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1451934"}
