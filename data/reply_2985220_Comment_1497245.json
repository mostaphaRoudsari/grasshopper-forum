{"body": "\nAbraham and Tim,\n\n\n\nIt sounds like this feature is less critical and I will plan to implement it when I add in the ability to bake meshes with image-mapped textures. \u00a0I've added a note to this on the github:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/241](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/241)\n\nI have a feeling that this implementation will happen after we have converted over to the new Honeybee API and so this might not happen until a release or two from now.\n\nStill, I promise it won't fall completely off the table.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 30, 2016 at 10:06pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1492650", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1497245"}
