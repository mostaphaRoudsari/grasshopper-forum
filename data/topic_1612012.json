{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nThere are 3 typical infiltration rates suggested in the Set EnergyPlus Zone Loads Component of Honeybee for tight, average and leaky buildings (see image). This is something I have always looked for but never found a simple answer, which in my opinion is very useful for most cases.\u00a0\n\nI have checked ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, 90.1, 62.1, and some other papers and publications with no luck.\n\nCould anybody give me more information about these values?\n\nThanks,\n\nJorge\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1612011", "name": "TypicalInfiltrationValues.png"}], "created_by_name": "Jorge Conejo", "created_at": "October 5, 2016 at 4:44pm", "created_by": "JorgeConejo", "topic": "Recommended Infiltration Rate", "id": "topic_1612012"}
