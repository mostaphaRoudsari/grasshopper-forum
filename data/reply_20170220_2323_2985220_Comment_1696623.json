{"body": "\nSolon,\n\nSee image and attached for workflow 1 working. It needs to be much simpler than what you tried. You need to input all desired windows to the base surface and not one by one, in tandem. Is working now.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/CSyxtXH-9chd2YMmpGffp8SiWTFq*KHERtOuRxrb7auPPI4TT4gMUPIIu8CQ1tgiMkpUkpK4GCW*XQqmsoRZLDVCjoY7CcSE/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/CSyxtXH-9chd2YMmpGffp8SiWTFq*KHERtOuRxrb7auPPI4TT4gMUPIIu8CQ1tgiMkpUkpK4GCW*XQqmsoRZLDVCjoY7CcSE/Capture.JPG)Didn't check workflow 2, but the error says it all. You can not assign an opaque material to a window. Right now you can not define a door element in HB and probably it will be tricky to do that. What i suggest is to define the window properties for the door with a VT of 0 (assuming is doesn't have any transparency), U value as you need and SHGC also as you need/know.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1696624", "name": "TrimmedSurface3_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 20, 2017 at 11:23PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1696618", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1696623"}
