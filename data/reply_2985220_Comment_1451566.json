{"body": "\nHi Khandaker,\n\nThere are tons of tutorials available about modeling with Rhino. For a geometry like the one in screen-shot you start from curves in plan and then extrude curves. You can create the roof by doing the same but in front view. I suggest you to take some time and watch some modeling tutorials.
