{"body": "\nThanks Yassin,\n\n\n\nIf you copy the Honeybee_Honeybee component from this file to any other files it will solve the issue on your system. It can work as a temporary fix but the problem seems to be the version of IronPython that you are using. It is 2.7.0 - beta.\n\n\n\nIf you update the IronPython to 2.7.3 or higher it should totally solve the issue ([http://ironpython.net/](http://ironpython.net/)).\n\n\n\nIt is strange that different versions of Rhino install different versions of IronPython!\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 8, 2014 at 7:38pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1022441", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1022245"}
