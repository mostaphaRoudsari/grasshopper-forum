I also noticed that the ground floor boundary condition is also empty.\u00a0\n\nAm I doing something wrong ?\n\nI am aware of the youtube HB energy modeling playlist and I have being using the label surface component which works perfectly in rhino but I thought this might be something similar to the construction that you just fixed.\u00a0\n\n(I meant the python code if I want to work on the mechanical systems part for example...
