{"body": "\nHi Orn,\n\nChris said it all. The only thing that I can add is that my approach is to add a -1 to the start of the lists and run the analysis only and only if the input is not -1. You can see that in example file.\n\nChris, what do you think about adding the component to extra tab at some point? I should re-write it in Python if we want to do so. I think it should be possible to take care of the current issues that Orn mentioned in the newer version.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 18, 2014 at 9:59pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151131", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151630"}
