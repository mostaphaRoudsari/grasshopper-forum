{"body": "\nIndeed fixed! Thanks and thank you for your amazing work so far! I think it would be interesting if we could also produce at the end a bill of materials including costs and factors like Embodied Energy and Carbon, Shadow costs and reports on Environmental Product Declaration formats. I wrote a plug in myself for my thesis but was focused only on steel constructions, assessing financial and environmental performance of Steel structures and producing EPDs for the whole building. I would find it very interesting to see something relevant implemented in Honeybee!\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 05, 2015 at 05:51PM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1218989", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1219194"}
