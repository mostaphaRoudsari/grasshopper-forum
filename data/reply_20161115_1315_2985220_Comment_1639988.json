{"body": "\nI attached a few files, the idf with \"CLEAR\" in the name is the one that Ladan shared last week and has the same problem as mine when trying to run the energy simulation. The one with \"New\" in the name is the one that I'm currently working with and is similar to hers. The gbXML file is also attached. Any hints to what may be causing the error would be appreciated. And in your opinion, do you think it would it be better to continue working with the idf or DWG?\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeremy Kong", "created_at": "November 15, 2016 at 01:15PM", "created_by": "JeremyKong", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1639900", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1639988"}
