{"body": "\nMohammed,\n\nI'm sorry for the incredibly late reply here. \u00a0I realized that the issue results from how OpenStudio names the ideal air load systems. \u00a0Specifically, OpenStudio does not write the name of the zone into the system name and this is causing the result reader to misinterpret the results. \u00a0Let me see if I can fix it now.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 7, 2017 at 6:53pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1732760", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1747277"}
