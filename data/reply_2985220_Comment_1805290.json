{"body": "\nErnst,\n\nHere is a full list of OpenStudio Resources that I typically send people when they are getting into it:\n\n\n\nOPENSTUDIO RESOURCES\n\nThe NREL OpenStudio Youtube Channel:<br/>[https://www.youtube.com/user/NRELOpenStudio](https://www.youtube.com/user/NRELOpenStudio)\n\nA Forum that is Great for Asking Questions to the OpenStudio Developers<br/>(or finding answers to your questions):<br/>[https://unmethours.com/questions/](https://unmethours.com/questions/)\n\nThe Building Components Library (and Measure Library)<br/>(measures are the Ruby scripts that you can run to change things about your model):<br/>[https://bcl.nrel.gov/](https://bcl.nrel.gov/)\n\nThe Full List of EnergyPlus Objects that OpenStudio Supports:<br/>[https://openstudio-sdk-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/cpp/OpenStudi...](https://openstudio-sdk-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/cpp/OpenStudio-2.1.0-doc/model/html/annotated.html)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, at the moment, we don't have video tutorials specifically related to Honeybee/OpenStudio integration and the best resource that I can point you towards are the example files:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/?keywords=OpenStudio](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/?keywords=OpenStudio)\n\nand especially those related to HVAC:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/?keywords=HVAC](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/?keywords=HVAC)\n\n\n\nMostapha and I are in the process of revising how we produce tutorial videos and we should be launching a platform soon that allows anyone to make monetary contributions towards the next free video series that we create. \u00a0If this ends up being as successful as we hope it will be, you should have some solid, high-quality resources for educating yourself soon enough!\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "on Monday", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1805227", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1805290"}
