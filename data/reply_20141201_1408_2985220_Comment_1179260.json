I am more versatile modelling with nurbs surfaces so I was going to have mesh as like the information layer and the nurbs surfaces as the fabrication layer. But since branching test points and test vectors relating to a large number of surfaces or curve inclusion is such a bottleneck,\u00a0now I do get the feeling that gaining more sophisticated control over the meshing process would be important to work with ladybug components.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBy the way, I have noticed that the radiation result is very different whether I input one mesh or a lot of surfaces. and the earlier version of the component (0.0.54) is now throwing up error saying \"too many values to unpack\" which means the component is out of date, I suppose.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KBI*TiKs6pI6kw92FjqNtNF1yPNKPVGUs1q3GY5A7jTBcZTzd85BNa9X5ZLbNaMZhThKFW7mSkMLkT3pklQjZfopp-RNpZaU/ttt_export_screenshot02.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KBI*TiKs6pI6kw92FjqNtNF1yPNKPVGUs1q3GY5A7jTBcZTzd85BNa9X5ZLbNaMZhThKFW7mSkMLkT3pklQjZfopp-RNpZaU/ttt_export_screenshot02.jpg)\n\nOn the left image you see radiation mesh (0.0.58) with one mesh as input, and on the right you see radiation mesh with exploded breps as input. To see what is happening inside the box with exploed breps as inputs,\u00a0I tried to see how the meshing is done inside the component (0.0.58) but not a lot of progress so far reading it.\n\n\n\nI am attaching a more concise definition\u00a0and the rhino file if you find the time to take a closer look.\u00a0\n\nRhino file is\u00a0[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rkdarg2fhvpwfiz/ttt_export%20%282%29.3dm?dl=0)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1179261", "name": "ttt.exportgh4.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "December 01, 2014 at 02:08PM", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1177142", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1179260"}
