{"body": "\nFrancesco and Djordje,\n\n\n\nI am just letting you know that I finished adding in a Microclimate Map Recipe for PET:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/6XUuZcXwzdoNHBg0am9bScBA9TSzHtigTQNPa1EqkBVtGo6CdadHzR6vRK0JFvTET98ZnGo-wPkeJgCV2BMez8EbpqzU7Y1N/PETMap.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/6XUuZcXwzdoNHBg0am9bScBA9TSzHtigTQNPa1EqkBVtGo6CdadHzR6vRK0JFvTET98ZnGo-wPkeJgCV2BMez8EbpqzU7Y1N/PETMap.JPG)\n\n\n\nYou can find an example file attached. \u00a0Implementing the recipe was also a great opportunity to understand the math behind PET and I have to say that I am very impressed. \u00a0I have been so skeptical of energy balance thermal comfort models since I learned of the many shortcomings of PMV but the level of detail in this model and the exposure of the human body variables is reinvigorating my interest. \u00a0I think I will start replacing a lot of the instances where I have used PMV/SET in the past with PET.\n\n\n\nI also realize how long it must have taken to assemble all of this sophisticated code for PET, Djordje. \u00a0Thank you again for adding this into an open source platform like LB. \u00a0The world of thermal comfort will certainly be better for it!\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1531662", "name": "PET_Microclimate_Map2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 17, 2016 at 7:33am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1531271", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1531661"}
