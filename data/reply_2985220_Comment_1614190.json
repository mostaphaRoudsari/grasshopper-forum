{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI don't define anywhere something related to Warehouses. I strictly defined each zone as MidriseApartment. You can see in this image where this is happening in the script:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vXmFHq1ldXD56G2zCPdMomG8uHQorQu6UNDF6m8PkZ-yAt1XlnX5Gjpm7LtGX7FV9OWl4Tq86ZDqsmeKAxQxdks-IX1-YMhX/Capture.JPG\" width=\"331\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vXmFHq1ldXD56G2zCPdMomG8uHQorQu6UNDF6m8PkZ-yAt1XlnX5Gjpm7LtGX7FV9OWl4Tq86ZDqsmeKAxQxdks-IX1-YMhX/Capture.JPG)\n\nAs for the schedules, also this image shows where i'm defining/assigning all of them:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vXmFHq1ldXDMh*jmjEpEmSr16QYM8tThJzQoHugHpEFY58v87LB8NS-eW5emwSxnvb9P6RvgcLaJaULwW2UWUHCOEsfyeadL/Schedules.JPG\" width=\"482\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vXmFHq1ldXDMh*jmjEpEmSr16QYM8tThJzQoHugHpEFY58v87LB8NS-eW5emwSxnvb9P6RvgcLaJaULwW2UWUHCOEsfyeadL/Schedules.JPG)\n\nBTW, the warehouse stuff appears ONLY in the exportToOpenStudio option.\n\n\n\nFinally, i'm not conditioning the zones. Explicitly i asked to set the isConditioned_ input in the HB_createHBZones to False. The discussion you mentioned approaches this differently oversizing the heating/Cooling so you never need the AC. The IDF created don't have any definition of IdealSystems, so i don't believe this is the problem. If you want to see the IDF files you can see them above (attached in a previous message).\n\nWeird ...\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 8, 2016 at 9:43pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1614166", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1614190"}
