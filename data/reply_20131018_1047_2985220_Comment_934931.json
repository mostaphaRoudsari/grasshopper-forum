{"body": "\nHi Diederik,\n\nThe short answer is yes you can do it but with the current released version which is uses genCumulativeSky to generate the sky it might fail. GenCumulativeSky has some bugs for hourly studies (check this\u00a0[discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/radiation-calculation-problem) as an example).\n\nThis is a perfect examples for what I have recently implemented to Ladybug. Using gendaymtx makes it extremely easy to do. Watch this video:([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3stJVyaRmg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3stJVyaRmg))\n\n\n\nIf you can't wait for the next release (which will happen at some point next week), send me your email so I can send you the link to the newer version and you can run what you are looking for pretty easy.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 18, 2013 at 10:47AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_934748", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_934931"}
