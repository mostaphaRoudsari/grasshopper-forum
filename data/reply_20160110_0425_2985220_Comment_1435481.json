{"body": "\nHello Mohamed, was wondering about a couple of things.\n\n\n\nDo you have any idea of commercial software that is using Sandia \u00a0(or equivalent algorithm that takes into account module temperature)? I mean is it something common? I've been trying to google Sandia around but not much info.\n\n\n\nFinally, are you aware if such a calculation is included in the NREL algorithm? I seem to remember smth related but its been a while I used it.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 10, 2016 at 04:25AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435303", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435481"}
