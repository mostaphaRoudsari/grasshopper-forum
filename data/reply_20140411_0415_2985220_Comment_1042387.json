{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThank you for your quick response and even more for such an amazing program! I watched the first webinar but unfortunately couldn't make it for the second one. Very good stuff!\n\n\n\nTo the point. The definition is just the same as you have put together with the example files. When working with it I came across some other questions:\n\n1- How do you define the size of the grid to match the length of the results with the mesh faces? A gird size 1 means that is 1 unit in which direction?\n\n2- Is there a predefined height for the room where the grid is? My room is divided in two, or in other words there are two analysis grids in it.\n\n\n\nAgain, thanks a lot!!!\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1042389", "name": "004_gridBasedAnalysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Gonzalez Damonte", "created_at": "April 11, 2014 at 04:15AM", "created_by": "GermanGonzalezDamonte", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1042042", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1042387"}
