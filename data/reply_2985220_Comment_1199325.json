{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\n\n\nI am having trouble following. I agree sky patch Radiance (kwh/m2*sr)\u00a0should not change with patch size and it\u00a0should appear smooth as you have shown. Up to this point I assumed the\u00a0Radiant Exitance (kWh/m2) in the \"value\" output\u00a0was actually a\u00a0measure of total radiant\u00a0energy (kWh)\u00a0per sky\u00a0patch.\u00a0I assumed the area of the skypatch (/m2 unit) was accounted for in your code so that any size skydome, be it 100m radius or 1km radius, would have the same values per skypatch. Changing the skydome scale in your module changes the patch areas but not the value, so this seems to hold. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf that is how it works, I would assume a larger patch should have more energy (larger value output). A skydome made of a single patch should have all the energy in it. So I expect the banding to occur when the patch size changes dramatically, as a different size sky patch would have a larger or smaller value output than one nearby with a different area. Instead, the banding occurs between similarly sized patches, and is relatively constant between other patches that change size dramatically. This doesn't line up with changes in solid\u00a0angle\u00a0as you describe. I cannot replicate your results and it confuses me. Can you please explain where I am going wrong? Thanks a lot.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "January 5, 2015 at 2:53pm", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1194310", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1199325"}
