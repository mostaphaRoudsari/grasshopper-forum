{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\n\n\nI definitely agree that it was better to wait to respond. \u00a0I should have finished all that I was planning to do with the DDY files before sending you the responses yesterday. \u00a0It took most of my day but I just finished making sure that the \"Run Simulation\" Component and the \"OpenStudio\" Component use the same method for sizing the HVAC system. \u00a0Here are the two recent commits in which this change was made:\n\n[Fixed Up AutoGen of DDY File](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/675db235c716db032789eecbb7519ed84dfd1548)\n\n[Added Function For Absence of DDY](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/280722f828f930001d4f5bddc22e532ee79b35a3)\n\n\n\nThe new sizing method involves first checking if there is any ddy file and, if there isn't one, I derive a ddy frile from the EPW data and ASHRAE standards. \u00a0This use of the ddy is better than sizing the system by running the model through the extreme weather file periods (what we were doing previously). \u00a0Sizing with the ddy results in fewer unment hours and it can be used for large HVAC systems as well as the ideal air system.\n\n\n\nI tested the new Run Simulation and OpenStudio components in a range of cases but, if you could update your components and confrim that they work for your Singapore file, that would be great.\n\n\n\nThanks again, Grasshope!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 24, 2016 at 12:07PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570565", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570755"}
