{"body": "Anas,\nThe version referenced in these release notes is what we have started calling the \"legacy version\" of Honeybee. It's a stable and mature version that nearly everyone is using as of the time of this post. The daylight simulations of this Legacy version use Daysim for annual daylight. Mostapha has been working for over a year on HoneybeePlus, which will run all simulations straight on Radiance (no Daysim). There should be a release of HoneybeePlus in the very very near future. Stay tuned for a post soon.", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 31, 2017 at 05:12PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1791545", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1791404"}
