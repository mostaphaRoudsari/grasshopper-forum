{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI have a strange problem with Ladybug and Honeybee. Sometimes when I open a new grasshopper document, Lb and HB can \"fly\", and other time they doesn't (all the components have the same error then).\n\nThe error is \"1. Solution exception:list.index(item): item not in list\"\n\nI don't understand from where it comes. Can you help me with this?\n\nThanks\n\nIlona\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1195256", "name": "Capture d'\u00e9cran 2014-12-28 16.11.51.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1195257", "name": "Document1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "ilona darmon", "created_at": "December 28, 2014 at 8:17am", "created_by": "ilonadarmon", "topic": "Error: Item not in list", "id": "topic_1195258"}
