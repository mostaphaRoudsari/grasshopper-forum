{"body": "\nHi Sarith and Charlene,\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for your responses!\n\n\n\nI ended up writing a bit of python to overlay annual simulations to have both sun and output from an IES-file (scaled depending of illuminance levels outside). It worked fine, I attatched results from a simple example.\n\n\n\nCharlene, I also had trouble with faulty\u00a0converted IES-files that made me believe the calculation was failing. I was not the one responsible for them, but in the future I will take great care that the photometric files that I'm supplied with are correct.\n\n\n\nAnna\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1692765", "name": "Dagsljusautonomi endast sol.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1692766", "name": "Dagsljusautonomi sol och parans.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Anna Larsson", "created_at": "February 16, 2017 at 05:15AM", "created_by": "AnnaLarsson", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1675386", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1692764"}
