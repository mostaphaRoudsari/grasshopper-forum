{"body": "\nWe have some students got the following errors using the GH file attached:\n\n\n\n1. the windows generated by glazing ratio is strange. there is window split into two triangles where it supposed to be a single rectangle. There is additional triangular window for non-rectangle wall surface\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/dm99ly9wi67nlLkHPVqKOiMB2Y7YIbIcWxx5kf4wncxC*7eT2mn7C6KCQEubx1qQNFHMoSeGsa3XiZXTtD7FcRBhKg-rwakh/04.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/dm99ly9wi67nlLkHPVqKOiMB2Y7YIbIcWxx5kf4wncxC*7eT2mn7C6KCQEubx1qQNFHMoSeGsa3XiZXTtD7FcRBhKg-rwakh/04.JPG)\n\n2. the error of EP simulation indicate that:\n\n**** Severe\u00a0 ** WindowMaterial:Blind=\"DEFAULTBLINDSMATERIAL_ZONE_A_SRF_1_GLZ_0\", Illegal value combination.<br/> **\u00a0\u00a0 ~~~\u00a0\u00a0 ** Blind to Glass Distance is less than half of the Slat Width**\n\n\n\nHowever, in the GH file, the distance of blind to window is set as half of the blind depth.\n\n\n\nDoes this mean that the **Window Shade Generator** component doesn't work with triangular window surface?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/dm99ly9wi66Rb9c8X30OHeL5SFop14vMMDGqPeE6GtaZ75-ZPtaoxTkWCDlObWfGeZvpz1vkU7i*eHwzf05t2*rmwqZQk23u/01.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/dm99ly9wi66Rb9c8X30OHeL5SFop14vMMDGqPeE6GtaZ75-ZPtaoxTkWCDlObWfGeZvpz1vkU7i*eHwzf05t2*rmwqZQk23u/01.JPG)\n\nHope to have your advice!\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1347872", "name": "glazing by ratio issue.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 23, 2015 at 11:29pm", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "add glazing by ratio issue and shade generator error", "id": "topic_1347873"}
