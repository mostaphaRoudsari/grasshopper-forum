{"body": "\nIt seems that the component called \"HBwatchthesky\" is not working while creating the files with the extension .irr, not even the HDR. Probably, this component is not finding the specified C:\\Radiance path and not even the C:\\Users path, as you can see in the image. It is the same file of the other day...\n\n\n\nThe .sky files are properly created but it seems that\u00a0\"HBwatchthesky\" can't read this files or something like that.\n\n\n\nAny idea? Could it be something related to the projectname, part of the name of the final path?\n\n\n\nThanks a lot in advance!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Eli Li Li", "created_at": "November 27, 2015 at 02:49PM", "created_by": "EliLiLi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1410072", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1410707"}
