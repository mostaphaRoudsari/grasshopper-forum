{"body": "\nMostapha, thanks for your quick reply.\u00a0\n\nYou are correct that the GhPython is not working.\u00a0 I reinstalled the older version 0.5.101 and while the test component is not red, it can't find the Python engine.\u00a0 But I already have Rhino 5 installed, so I am wondering whether it is corrupt or whether there is some incompatibility.\n\nI even emptied out my Libraries and UserObjects folders except for the GhPython in order to minimize the conflicts.\u00a0 Would that cause a problem?\n\nDo I need to reinstall Rhino and GH?\u00a0 Would being on the Zoo make any difference?\u00a0 I plan to switch it back to my own license).\n\n\n\nNancy\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1157942", "name": "No Python engine.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Nancy Yen-wen Cheng", "created_at": "October 29, 2014 at 10:41AM", "created_by": "NancyYenwenCheng", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1157501", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1157941"}
