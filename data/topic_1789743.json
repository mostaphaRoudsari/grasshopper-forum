{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI have been trying for a while now (quite unsucesfully) to make a detailed model following appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1. using honeybee to comply with LEED v3 requirements.\n\n\n\nI\u00b4ve been in contact with Anton Szilasi who kindly adviced me to look for other software options more suitable for this kind of model. I just wanted to know if anyone has tried to do something similiar and if someone has any advice. It is a 7 story office building with \u00a04 semi-underground basement levels.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest.\n\nArturo Reyes\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "LUIS ARTURO REYES VALENCIA", "created_at": "July 27, 2017 at 3:48pm", "created_by": "LUISARTUROREYESVALENCIA", "topic": "LEED detailed model  appendix G ASHRAE 90.1", "id": "topic_1789743"}
