{"body": "\nhi Ding-\n\n\n\nWhat you are asking for is three different things:\n\n\n\n1.) \u00a0That Honeybee will recognize a hole cut in a surface in Grasshopper as an air wall. \u00a0It should be possible to cut the hole in the wall, but currently, the wall does not get turned automatically into an air wall. \u00a0This however, is likely not the only root of the problem.\n\n2.) \u00a0You can manually assign a wall to be anything you want in Honeybee, including an air wall, though this was not the purpose of the latest release of Honeybee, it is possible.\n\n3.) Even if the assignment is there, will DB recognize it? \u00a0You can check this if you want by changing an interior wall to \"air wall\". \u00a0Will you test if when you have done this, if DB recognizes it or not? \u00a0\n\n\n\nYou may or may not be surprised to learn that nearly every import tool ignores the surface constructions. \u00a0I encourage you to try and raise this as an important issue with DB. \u00a0When enough people complain loudly enough, it seems to get pushed up the cue. \u00a0This is not an attack on DB, it seems to be the way I've seen most software development make progress.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chien Si Harriman", "created_at": "July 14, 2014 at 10:04am", "created_by": "ChienSiHarriman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1100710", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1101608"}
