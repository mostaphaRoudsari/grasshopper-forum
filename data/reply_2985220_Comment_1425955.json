{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply. It would be amazingly helpful if we can get their input on how to develop a co-simulation between EnergyPlus and an agent-based model. I've seen from the BCTVB site that they are either using what they calll ExternalInteface objects or EMS components. I think the EMS would be the best solution as well, just for matters of consistency. Apparently there are a couple of examples given along with the software.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, after a couple of hours browsing the site I came into my usual \"wall\". It's kind of hard for me to understand the underlying code of the thing given I'm not very familiar with E+ scripting language. I will keep trying though. I could move a lot faster if I had practical experience. I wonder if they already have examples of co-simulation (other than the templates offered with the software) that they would be willing to share.\n\n\n\nAnyways, I've decided to turn my Christmas holidays to a mini sabbatical. I'll focus on collecting literature on agent based models of thermal comfort as well as mathematical models and statistics on human behavior in buildings. Hopefully, we can use all the above once we understand how to link E+ to such models.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "December 23, 2015 at 11:21pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1426044", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1425955"}
