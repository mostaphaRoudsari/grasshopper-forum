{"body": "\nHi Mostapha - is there a way to know how to update that name for the schedule libraries ? I don't have openstudio and am not an admin on the computer I use, so I can't install anything ... The Grizzlybear option was great for me so far, any chance to have that back running ?\n\n\n\nThanks a lot !\n\nEmma\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Eliott", "created_at": "October 27, 2016 at 03:36AM", "created_by": "Eliott", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619808", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1626506"}
