{"body": "\nHi all\n\n\n\nfor shading control we need irradiance values at specific points. Triggerpoint is 150 W/m2 at outer surface.\n\nI first calculated them with the Ladybug cumulativeSkyMatrix as in example 05 Real Time Radiation Analysis.\n\nWhen I realised, that with this component you can't examine a whole period, because all values are summarized, I switched to the\u00a0 HoneyBee Run daylight Simulation method provided here. Thanks for sharing.\u00a0 ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hobeybee-ho...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hobeybee-hourly-solar-radiation))\n\n\n\nWhen I compare the results for particular HOY, then they differ slightly.\n\nExample: at 04 18 17:00\n\nLB cumulativeSkyMatrix: 786 W/m2\n\nHB Run daylight Simulation: 816 W/m2\n\n\n\nCan someone enlight me about the calc\u00a0algorithm behind the two methods and which one is the one to be more trusted.\n\n\n\n-rpict\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "rpict", "created_at": "April 22, 2015 at 10:57am", "created_by": "rpict", "topic": "Difference between irradiance calcs with LB cumulativeSkyMatrix and HB Run daylight Simulation", "id": "topic_1269701"}
