{"body": "\nHi Everyone.\n\n\n\nI am trying to use the Ladybug\u00a0Radiation Analysis tool in to visualize\u00a0the shading patterns created by a series of parametric shading devices.\n\n\n\nHowever when i input the surfaces i want to analyse the shading on the output is always the same uniform values. I have tried imputing various context geometries, Analysis periods and grid sizes and also rebuilt and flipped the direction of the surface being referenced into grasshopper; always with the same result, shown below.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"328\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/BjPsdF1MrUkiG-k5NbrJZtFxv4ieoVJDdTVPoO9AoAgeB9S-TAjFshRf5WBlQ6HRYfqXLP8PN18OBC8doxra9VKZJU91eV-j/Screenshot82.png?width=750\" width=\"584\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/BjPsdF1MrUkiG-k5NbrJZtFxv4ieoVJDdTVPoO9AoAgeB9S-TAjFshRf5WBlQ6HRYfqXLP8PN18OBC8doxra9VKZJU91eV-j/Screenshot82.png)I Don't think there is a problem with my definition as when i plug the shading devices themselves into the geometry input the definition works fine.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"331\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/BjPsdF1MrUnv7j*9FlBYDaDMjm6YXR2NDa-w2zMidXwfrLWCF97qJWy04fZvLHe8ECFkkWnGPJDFvdekrLR-ypcosO7zcviO/Screenshot80.png?width=750\" width=\"590\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/BjPsdF1MrUnv7j*9FlBYDaDMjm6YXR2NDa-w2zMidXwfrLWCF97qJWy04fZvLHe8ECFkkWnGPJDFvdekrLR-ypcosO7zcviO/Screenshot80.png)Am i trying to make this tool do something it isn't designed for, or have i made some other mistake? \u00a0Below is my definition, any help would be greatly appreiated.\u00a0\n\n-Geoff\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/BjPsdF1MrUmy1c4J1lzXyEtws9boJwFyNGTks2m4dJbchI85LTxQglPs8-E9hJDhpqDAv1cP4hR0e0Kz3rMW3Ae9PGL-f*Nv/Screenshot81.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/BjPsdF1MrUmy1c4J1lzXyEtws9boJwFyNGTks2m4dJbchI85LTxQglPs8-E9hJDhpqDAv1cP4hR0e0Kz3rMW3Ae9PGL-f*Nv/Screenshot81.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Geoffrey Goerling", "created_at": "May 6, 2016 at 4:57am", "created_by": "GeoffreyGoerling", "topic": "Am I Misusing the LB Radiation analysis tool?", "id": "topic_1524086"}
