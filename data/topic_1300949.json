{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI am trying to perform a daylighting simulation and I want to set different window RAD materials in a same room.\n\nI have already drawn the window sizes (as surfaces) and room geometry (as brep).\u00a0\n\nI have used the 'addHBGlz' component, but I can only set the same RAD material for each window. I have tried other combinations but they didn't work.\n\n\n\nHow can I do? Any suggestion?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nRiccardo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Riccardo Diaferia", "created_at": "June 1, 2015 at 4:39pm", "created_by": "RiccardoDiaferia49", "topic": "Setting different window properties", "id": "topic_1300949"}
