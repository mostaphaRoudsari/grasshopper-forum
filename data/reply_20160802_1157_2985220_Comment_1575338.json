{"body": "\nHi Grasshoppe,\n\n\n\nThe new OF version is using a new Docker technology that Mostapha believes will make installation/setting up OF + BF interaction much easier. Unfortunately, it does not at the time work. I believe this is the n1 item on the list and it will be fixed until the public release coming shortly. Hang in there!\n\n\n\nCheck:\u00a0[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly/issues/43](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly/issues/43)\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, please let us know of the values you had to change manually in controlDict and fvSolution. Was that due to wrong values set from BF or was it because they weren't updated through BF?\u00a0\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "August 02, 2016 at 11:57AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1574828", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1575338"}
