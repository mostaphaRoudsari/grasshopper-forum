{"body": "\nThere are people here who could probably answer your question better, but the \"air movement\" element would be accomplished through Fluid Dynamics (CFD). I'm not sure\u00a0Honeybee + Ladybug have that capbility yet (I've seen talk about it being WIP though). Real CFD work can be extremely sophisticated. I've worked with consultants who specialize in it, but have never really engaged it in the Grasshopper realm.\n\nIn regards to weather responsive stuff, Lady bug has lots of tools for interacting with local weather data through your local .epw file. That could be combined with some of the radiation tools for building massing.\n\n\n\nSounds like an interesting project. I'd love to see what kind criteria is developed in order to get meaningful kenetic facade behavior.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "will krzymowski", "created_at": "February 03, 2015 at 12:18AM", "created_by": "willkrzymowski", "parent_id": "topic_1215809", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1216161"}
