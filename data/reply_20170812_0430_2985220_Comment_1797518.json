{"body": "Hi Ji,\n\nI am not as much of a radiance guru as others on this forum but I can say that the Radiance glass material is a simplified model and I would not be surprised if there was some default reflectance assumed for it. From your image, it looks like it is assuming some specular reflectance to account for the mirror-like properties of smooth glass. If you need precise control over the amount of light that is reflected vs transmitted vs absorbed, I would recommend using the Radiance trans material. Otherwise, if you just need a material with 0 reflectance, the opaque material should suit your needs.\nI hope that helps,\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 12, 2017 at 04:30AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1796407", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1797518"}
