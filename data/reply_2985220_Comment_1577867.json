{"body": "\nAh, gosh. \u00a0Sorry. \u00a0Everyone is watching the Olympics now and this is making the internet move very slowly. \u00a0The GH site just lost my whole reply to you because of the bad connection. \u00a0I'll try to reproduce it below. Here are the main points:\n\n\n\n1) A number of components have moved out of WIP now so, if you don't see them initially, look for them by searching.\n\n\n\n2) I took out the Wh2kWh because it literally doesn't do anything except multiply data by 1000, which is something that users can do themselves with the native GH multiplication component or they can do in their heads. \u00a0We have a lot of unit conversion components now and I would rather use the available space for truly useful conversions (like those between SI and IP).\n\n\n\n3) Djordje never sent a pull request for the pedestrian wind comfort component because we got lost in a debate about whether we could include it in Butterfly. \u00a0I realized eventually that it should be in LB for the time being and I sent him a reminder here:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/266](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/266)\n\nHopefully, he should send a pull request in the next couple of days.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 7, 2016 at 8:20am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578044", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1577867"}
