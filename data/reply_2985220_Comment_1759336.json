{"body": "\nCompletely agree with Sarith.\n\nRadiation and temperature are not the same.\n\nIf the checking is on a specific geometry, there is some logic that in winter time you get MORE radiation in south (north, in Brasil). The reason is simple: the sun is lower and more perpendicular to the wall.\n\nI've been doing some tests so you can get this picture better. See radiation roses for your 4 analysis period. You see there that in june (your winter) the radiation is higher than in june for the north facade (you can also see there the amount of diffuse and direct).\n\nI also added some basic geometry to illustrate the orientation influence. You see there the same as in the roses.\n\nI'm sure that after this you'll be more clear in the topic.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1759337", "name": "RadiationAnalysis_AY-01.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 29, 2017 at 2:13am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1759000", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1759336"}
