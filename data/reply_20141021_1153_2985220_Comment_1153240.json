{"body": "\nHi Kaley,\n\nThis is because of the white space in the filepath. Create a new folder manually (with no whitespace), copy gendaymtx.exe to that folder and set workingDir_ to that folder and everything should work fine.\n\nSorry for the inconvenience. We will fix the issue with white space for the next release.\n\n-Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 21, 2014 at 11:53AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1153138", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1153240"}
