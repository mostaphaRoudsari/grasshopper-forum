{"body": "\nHi Chris, Thank you so much for your help and explanation about PMV and outdoor comfort analyses! Maybe I'll use\u00a0\"Thermal Comfort Indices\" to obtain MRT values (thank you again because i didn't know how many different metrics it can calculate), however I'will refer to UTCI values for Outdoor comfort, while we waiting to find a good documentation about PET.\n\nThank you Chris!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Luciano", "created_at": "January 22, 2015 at 06:11PM", "created_by": "Ambrosinus", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209535", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209485"}
