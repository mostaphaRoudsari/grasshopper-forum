{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nI am Jonny's colleague. Thanks a lot for your reply! It would be very helpful if Therm users could directly assign Radiation model through Honeybee.\n\n\n\nRegarding your questions,\n\n\n\n1. Yes. According to NFRC(National Fenestration Rating Council) manual, the exterior is always assigned to \u201cBlack body radiation model\u201d.\n\n\n\n2. I will assume the view factor is 1. Also, the view factor is defined as 1 in the build-in boundary condition library from Therm.\u00a0\n\n\n\n3. I have never used the \"Constant Heat Flux\" before.\n\n\n\nI attached screenshot from Therm for \"NFRC Exterior Boundary Conditions\" and \"Interior Thermally Broken Frame Boundary Conditions\" here, hope the information could help a little bit.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks again,\n\nGrace\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1758466", "name": "NFRC Exterior boundary condition.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1758467", "name": "NFRC Interior boundary condition - Frame.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Grace Huang", "created_at": "May 26, 2017 at 10:40pm", "created_by": "GraceHuang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1758193", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1758464"}
