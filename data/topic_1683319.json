But it has created doublons... I have all components twice and still, no one working.\n\n\n\nI did not find a way to unistall them, anyone has an idea?\n\nI use LB et HB on different computer (works great) but on this new one, i can't make it work :-(\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nAntoine\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antoine Maes", "created_at": "February 2, 2017 at 5:16am", "created_by": "AntoineMaes", "topic": "How to uninstall Lagybug/Honeybee", "id": "topic_1683319"}
