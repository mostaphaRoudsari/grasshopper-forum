{"body": "\nDear\u00a0Francesco and\u00a0Mostapha,\n\n\n\nFollowed by your old post, I have a question regarding the work mechanism of the lighting control in HB/Daysim.\n\n\n\nTo make it short:\n\n**Which** specific sensor point (out of many) in your \"lightingControlGroup\"\u00a0should fulfill the requirement of **\"****lightingSetpoint\"** (300lux)?\n\n\n\nin other words:\n\nDoes it mean that\u00a0the **average illuminance** calculated from **all the \"sensorPoints\"** in your \"lightingControlGroup\"\u00a0should\u00a0fulfill the **\"****lightingSetpoint\"\u00a0**requirement?\n\n(if this is the case, but the lighting schedule obtained from DSElectricalLightingUse is **different** from the\u00a0lighting schedule\u00a0obtained by post-processing/checking all the hourly illuminance results at all the sensorPoints)\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your kind help!\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "March 03, 2016 at 05:12PM", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256837", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1477113"}
