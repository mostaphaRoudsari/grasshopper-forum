{"body": "\nHello again,\n\nI am using the Solar Envelope component and it is much advanced than before, congratulations for the work. But it still present some limitations. I mean the input _sunVectors limits the use of the tool at one building per time and it is even not very efficient. For example in a situation like the image I attach I have four buildings facing the area on which I need to calculate the solar envelope that guarantees 2 hours of direct sunlight on all the surrounding facades. If I have to input the sun vectors that guarantee 2 hours insolation for the South facing facade (from 11 to 13) then the solar envelope is most likely not correct for the East and West facing facades and it totally null for the North facing facade. So the suggestion is to develop further Solar Envelope component and add to the _sunVectors input also another input for the required minimum hours on specific facades. Thank you!!\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/odYCBfvo76aOq2z*s6niLPXQgBzo9aRMbw8sWp7lK5HT6zcO8DX8I9j2OwpGmkF39CL7P8jJixjGCgMAKEsPRjJ*TDZxi6Xo/envelopeviewport.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/odYCBfvo76aOq2z*s6niLPXQgBzo9aRMbw8sWp7lK5HT6zcO8DX8I9j2OwpGmkF39CL7P8jJixjGCgMAKEsPRjJ*TDZxi6Xo/envelopeviewport.JPG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "November 19, 2015 at 07:04AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "Solar Envelope input", "id": "topic_1404397"}
