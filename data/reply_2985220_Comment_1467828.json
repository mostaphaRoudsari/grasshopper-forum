{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nI was intrigued by your suggestion and so I tried switching it to list access with a for loop inside of the component. \u00a0Unfortunately, it seems to have taken slightly more time (6.1 minutes), although I would call these runtimes pretty much equal:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/frolw-dWeEiptfF5CaIebeP6gUlOXIKjxIVfShNOmEnpnW2VXjRxyLuEWBM6gbd5KJicgnhc7DaUTgfBN4*X9T7AkQ44fnJy/ListAccess.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/frolw-dWeEiptfF5CaIebeP6gUlOXIKjxIVfShNOmEnpnW2VXjRxyLuEWBM6gbd5KJicgnhc7DaUTgfBN4*X9T7AkQ44fnJy/ListAccess.JPG)\n\n(see attached GH file if you want to see for yourself)\n\n\n\nJudging from what I know of the time-consuming functions in Honeybee, I am nearly positive that the long runtime of the component is the result of the recallFromHBHive() function. \u00a0The fact that we make a deep copy of the zone and all of its properties really takes up the vast majority of time in many HB components.\n\nIt has occurred to me that, if we are not editing the zone, there is no need to make a deep copy of it. \u00a0If you can confirm that this is true, we really should make a function that just returns the zones as they are. \u00a0This would make this component and all of the result visualization components that I have written much, much faster.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1467829", "name": "eplus_generator_000_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 20, 2016 at 9:54pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1467504", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1467828"}
