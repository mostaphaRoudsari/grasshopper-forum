{"body": "\nHi Aaron,\n\nEnergyPlus cannot handle nonplanar surfaces and so many other stuff, which Honeybee has to take care of and make the geometry understandable for EP.\n\nYou can find where the surface is by importing back the .idf file into Grasshopper (using import idf) or by opening the .idf file in other tools such as OpenStudio. We are working on a component that will let you bring the results in for nonplanar surfaces but it is not ready yet ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/171](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/171)).\n\nThat is why I made the recommendation to simplify your input geometry then you can easily trace the results plus it won't really make a huge difference in the results of energy model and it will run much faster.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 10, 2014 at 8:33pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1128791", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1129817"}
