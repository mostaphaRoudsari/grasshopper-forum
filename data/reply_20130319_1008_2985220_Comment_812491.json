{"body": "\nA good way to check the density of the mesh [in case the inputs are brep] is not to connect sunVectors or genCumSkyResult\u00a0(respectively for\u00a0**Sunlight Hours Analysis**\u00a0and\u00a0**Radiation Analysis**) and set runIt to True.\n\nThe component will mesh the surfaces and output analysisMesh and testPts. You can check the testPts, change the gridSize and make sure it is as dense as you want before running the analysis. As soon as you are happy with the testPts connect the\u00a0sunVectors or\u00a0genCumSkyResult and the analysis will be run!\n\n-Mostapha\n\n\n\nPS:\u00a0I didn't know about Ctrl+F11 shortcut! Very good to know.
