{"body": "\nHi Sarith,\n\n\n\nMany thanks for your reply. Rendering is new to me and I'm not sure I fully understand it. I simply want the coloured heat map, which represents incident radiation, to render on top of the building massings such that they can be included in a report to comment of the viability of putting PV on the roofs. At the moment, the buildings are rendering, but the radiation analysis is not. Is there a simple fix or workaround for this?\n\n\n\nThanks.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "T Wigg", "created_at": "July 12, 2017 at 1:57am", "created_by": "TWigg", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1782383", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1782757"}
