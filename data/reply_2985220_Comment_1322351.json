You may need to run much more simulations at the same time - I also think there might be solutions to pre-run the simulations.\n\nOne of the feedback that I was always thinking to give to an occupant is to tell them the effect of their decision also in $. For example if you can tell them by bringing the thermostat down for 2 degrees and tolerating a higher comfort range they will save X amount of money in the year that might make people thinking about it in a different way.
