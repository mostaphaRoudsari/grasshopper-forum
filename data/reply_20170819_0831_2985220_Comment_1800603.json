{"body": "\nHi Amir,\n\nIn addition to the string you plugged into additionalStrings, you'd have to define a few more E+ classes for the simulation to run correctly.\n\n\n\nSpecifically:\n\nHeatBalanceAlgorithm - the Algorithm must be set ConductionFiniteDifference\n\nan additional Class:\n\nHeatBalanceSettings:ConductionFiniteDifference(If I remember correctly, the default settings were fine)\n\n\n\nI coded some components that automatically concatenated these strings, but I can't remember where I placed them. I'll see if I can find them.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pin", "created_at": "August 19, 2017 at 08:31AM", "created_by": "Pin", "parent_id": "topic_1800571", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1800603"}
