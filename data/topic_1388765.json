{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\n\nI am running a series of annual daylight simulations to get readings for sDA and ASE, but naturally the process time is quite long.\n\n\n\nI know for quick analysis using 3DS Max Design, you can specify certain frames to render for a weather file/Perez sky model analysis to provide illuminance readings for certain days of the year.\n\n\n\nIs there a way we could do this in Honeybee much like the analysis period component from ladybug, but specify several disconnected periods instead of one period (5 days of every month for example)?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "October 28, 2015 at 10:05pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Annual Daylight Simulation: Running the simulation for only a few days in each month", "id": "topic_1388765"}
