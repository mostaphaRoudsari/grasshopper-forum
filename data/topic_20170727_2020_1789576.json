{"body": "\nHi, I'm struggling with five 'severe errors' when trying to run an energy simulation. Some of the errors seem erroneous e.g. no weather file attached, whilst others I'm not clear about.\n\nI have run this script in the past (2 years ago!) no problems, but am revisiting/updating all components. I have latest GH/Ladybird/Honeybee and removed old stuff. Connecting fine with EnergyPlus.\n\nIf you can help that would be great. Thanks.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1789574", "name": "Opt 1.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1789575", "name": "Opt 1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Robert Doe", "created_at": "July 27, 2017 at 08:20PM", "created_by": "RobertDoe", "topic": "Energy Simulation severe errors", "id": "topic_1789576"}
