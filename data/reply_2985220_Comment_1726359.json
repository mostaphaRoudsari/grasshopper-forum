{"body": "\nHi Filippo,\n\nThe \"Sunpath shading\" component's **shadedSolarRadiationPerHour** output will not take into account the multi-reflection of the solar radiation/rays from the ground, and then to other vertical surfaces (building facades for example).<br/>Still ground reflected solar radiation is the lowest of the three solar radiation components (beam and diffuse).<br/>If your location is somewhere in the Mediterranean Italy, then it is unlikely that albedo values will be altered for the influence of snow and therefor affect your ground reflected radiation.<br/>The **albedo_** input (and through it the ground reflected radiation itself) can be important for calculation of solar radiation on a Photovoltaics module, or a Solar hot water collecter, in higher latitude locations, or mountainous locations, with high modules/collectors tilt angles.<br/>So you can include the ground surface, but that won't make a difference.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "April 3, 2017 at 8:59am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726095", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726359"}
