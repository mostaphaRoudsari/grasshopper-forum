{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\n\n\nThank you for the input. \u00a0I have updated the chart such that you now only get one data set out if you connect up a windSpeed list that aligns with the temperature lists. \u00a0You still get two comfort polygons generated for the max and min of the windSpeed dataset. \u00a0You can see this in the attached file.\n\nI will update the psychrometric chart to behave similarly in the future:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/247](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/247)\n\n\n\nThanks again for all of the suggestions,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1492117", "name": "BetterAdativeComfChart.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 24, 2016 at 07:37PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490997", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1492116"}
