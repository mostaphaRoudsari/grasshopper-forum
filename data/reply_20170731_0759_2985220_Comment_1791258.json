{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nIt prints: JUL_28_2017\n\nAnd it is printed in Rhino's command line.\n\nAs i said it used to work, months ago, and at some point it stopped. I suspect it was related with uninstalling Python 3.x becouse of problems with the envi-met plugin. There were some instructions how to deal with Ironpython install by (forgot his name) Piacentino.\n\nAlso, the datetime doesn't have the strptime but has a strftime function. But it doesn't work either.\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 31, 2017 at 07:59AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1791165", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1791258"}
