{"body": "\nHello All, I am trying to plot data generated outside of Grasshopper onto a Ladybug psych chart, but I cannot figure out how to do this. I'm still quite new to Grasshopper and Ladybug.\n\nI have gone through Chris Mackey's excellent youtube tutorials on the psych chart, I have scanned the forums and googled my best, but am still stuck so any assistance would be greatly appreciated!\n\nMy assumption was that I could copy DBT and RH data into panels and then plug those into the psych chart. This isn't working but I'm not sure how else to approach this.\n\nI have tried a few things and have come across the following errors:\n\n1) The psych chart does not work if I plug in more than 2 data points for dry bulb &amp; RH (unless I'm plugging in EPW data, of course). I get the following error: \"1. Solution exception:index out of range: 0\"\n\n2) I can't paste in all 8760 lines of data into a panel. Sometimes I get around 4700 lines in, other times, it's around 5600. I thought it was an issue with not being able to store that much data while copying, but when I hit a return after the last line of data, it doesn't let me add another line.\n\n3) (perhaps related?) I noticed that if I plug EPW data into panels and then into the psych chart component I get the error: \"1. Solution exception:unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'\" I assume this is why just copying data into a panel to plug into the psych chart component doesn't work?\n\nI have attached examples replicating the above issues. \u00a0Thanks in advance for your help!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1647925", "name": "psychChartProblems.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Priya Gandhi", "created_at": "November 28, 2016 at 4:24pm", "created_by": "PriyaGandhi", "topic": "How to import non-EPW data for use with the Ladybug psych chart?", "id": "topic_1647926"}
