{"body": "\n1) You would have to connect all the geometry you have (a room, and the ground surface around the room to the **context_** input). The \"Terrain shading mask\" component would then scale the mask, and depending on the topography of your location you will probably end up with a 10 000 meters mask radius.<br/><br/>2) Again you would plug in all the geometry (those blocks) into the **context_** input. Depending on the topography of the location, you will probably end up with a mask radius higher than 10 000 meters.<br/>But in this case the default value of 0 of the **minVisibilityRadius_** input needs to be increased, so that the topography near the location gets excluded. Which is exactly what the **minVisibilityRadius_** serves for.<br/>To my knowledge there is no paper which describes the exact amount of the **minVisibilityRadius_** which needs to be used.<br/>[ShadeUp plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFU8D1nBYKQ) for example uses 50 meters of **minVisibilityRadius_** by default and 50 000 meters of **maxVisibilityRadius_** by default, for objects of a tens of meters in diameter.<br/>Something similar can be applied to our **minVisibilityRadius_** input. For example: for relatively flat location surroundings one can use **minVisibilityRadius_** to be at least 3 times larger than the contextRadius output. For more hilly locations surroundings this value can be increased (6, 7 times of the contextRadius).<br/>For example if the contextRadius is 600 meters, **minVisibilityRadius_** can be 3.6 kilometers, and so on.<br/><br/>Let me know if this answers your questions.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "August 08, 2016 at 02:02PM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578391", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578501"}
