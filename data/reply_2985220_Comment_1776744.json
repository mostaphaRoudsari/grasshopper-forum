{"body": "\nHi grasshope\n\nThank you very much for your help?\n\nSince this project is simulating a existing building, shape of zones could not be controlled by my self. In this case, is it possible for me to combine two zones into one zone so that I can combine several convex zones to make a non-convex zone? I understand air wall could be applied, but If I do that, honey bee would give two results for two zones, but I just want information for one combined zone.\n\nThank you.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Considering", "created_at": "June 30, 2017 at 10:21am", "created_by": "Considering", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1776625", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1776744"}
