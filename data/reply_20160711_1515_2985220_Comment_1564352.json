{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nYou can find more info about the ashik material\u00a0in this link\n\n[http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2012-copenhagen/...](http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2012-copenhagen/Day2/Ward/RadianceImprovements.pdf)\n\n\n\nNow, the simulations work fine, but after careful look at the .rad file, I found out that the material ashik2 isn't passed to the .rad file generated\u00a0by Honeybee. I doubt that it's Honeybee's fault, simply because I'm having the same problem when I use DIVA as well.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "July 11, 2016 at 03:15PM", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1564244", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1564352"}
