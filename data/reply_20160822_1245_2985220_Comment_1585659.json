{"body": "\nHi Ashish,\n\n\n\nYou can refer section 3.2.1 of Andy McNeil's[3 Phase tutorial](https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/Tutorial-ThreePhaseMethod.pdf) to get an idea on how to create xml files and incorporate them as BSDFs in Radiance Simulations.\n\nIf you run into issues with HB while doing so, a crude way out would be to incorporate the material and geometry into the simulation using the additionalRadFiles_ option in the Run Daylight Simulation component. And make sure that your file path does not have any spaces in them. Radiance does not play well with files that have spaces in them, partly because of the fact that the default delimiter in Radiance is whitespace.\n\n\n\nSarith\n\n\n\n(PS: I don't do energy simulations, so I have no idea about how to replicate this workflow in E+ )\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "August 22, 2016 at 12:45PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1585732", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1585659"}
