{"body": "\nHi there\n\n\n\nI'm running annual analysis to find peak values of solar radiation. With honeybee i can run the radiance simulation on 500pts in roughly 20 seconds. However, I'm using 5 minuttes to load the annual data into grasshopper.\n\n\n\nI think the grasshopper (1 core mode) way of reading these annual results is a bottleneck here. I was wondering if its possible through python or an external part of honeybee to make some statistics on the annual datas.\n\n\n\nSuch as:\n\n- Num of hours above a certain value (returns one value per point)\n\n- Max value (returns one value per point)\n\n- Date of the max value (returns one value per point)\n\n- 75% percentile of max value (returns one value per point)\n\n\n\nAs it is now, people use the accomulated annual data to get an idea of energy usage, but I think we need to include these peak values to get an idea on if our ventilation/cooling system is good enough. I know Energyplus can do this simulation, but looking at pure solar gains is good for early phase and facade designs.\n\n\n\nBest, Mathias.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mathias s n", "created_at": "September 04, 2015 at 07:33AM", "created_by": "Mathiassn", "topic": "Peak annual values", "id": "topic_1354812"}
