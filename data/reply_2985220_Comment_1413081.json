{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,<br/><br/>first of all I want to tell you that you and your colleagues are doing a great job with LadyBug and HoneyBee. Never had the chance to thank you before so, thanks!<br/><br/>Unfortunately today I've had too many things to do and I didn't manage to check properly Anton's panel. At a first look it looks great anyway.<br/>Just, if you add this updated component to HoneyBee I would suggest you to add another input. Actually the preset for the Shading Control Type is \"ALWAYSON\" but it needs to be replaced with \"OnIfHighSolarOnWindow\" for example. Otherwise the setpoint is useless I think.<br/>I solved it just by replacing every \"ALWAYSON\" there was in the code with the name of the new desired type and it apparently works fine (I'll update if something get wrong), but maybe you have a nice way to implement it into your HoneyBee panel.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your help.<br/>Claudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Marini", "created_at": "December 1, 2015 at 11:06am", "created_by": "ClaudioMarini", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412671", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1413081"}
