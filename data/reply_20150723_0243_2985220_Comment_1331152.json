{"body": "\nHi Atis,<br/><br/>The \"TOF\" component uses directNormalRadiation and diffuseHorizontalRadiation data from the .epw file to calculate the incident radiation hitting the PV surface plane.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why you might get tilt angle closer to 0, is because your location is closer to equator. The smaller the latitude, the smaller the tilt angle.<br/>Still getting exactly 0.00 value, sounds like a precision issue. Try increasing the \"precision_\" input parameter to, say \"20\". If it does not take too long for the \"TOF\" component to recalculate, you can increase this value even higher. The larger the \"precision_\" input value is, the more precise your optimal tilt and azimuth values will be.<br/><br/>Hope that helps. If not, please let me know.\n\nFor future issues, it is always helpful when one attaches the .gh file along with posting a question. Thank you.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 02:43AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "topic_1330703", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1331152"}
