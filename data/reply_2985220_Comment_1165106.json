{"body": "\nThanks for the knowledge and wisdom, Mostapha.\n\nFor the sake of my own curiosity, could you explain more about what\u00a0ds_shortterm does that is different from the climate based sky. \u00a0I tested just to be sure that I was actually getting sub-hour skies with the climate based sky as seen here:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/TtwBo078M6gJ30M0iLIeO6WXpTvSktC22AqByZTsYqnigOAK-212O0T2lO3xXhxxKI0iQC*Dxl6ANoL-m9Wvi0i1f8ZYeMG*/Subhourskies.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/TtwBo078M6gJ30M0iLIeO6WXpTvSktC22AqByZTsYqnigOAK-212O0T2lO3xXhxxKI0iQC*Dxl6ANoL-m9Wvi0i1f8ZYeMG*/Subhourskies.PNG)\n\nAm I right in thinking that\u00a0ds_shortterm generates cumulative skies at sub-hour timesteps? \u00a0If so, I understand why it's not so useful to integrate it into HB as the\u00a0increased\u00a0accuracy of sub-hour timesteps is probably offset by the poor resolution of 145 sky patches.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 9, 2014 at 2:03pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1164509", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1165106"}
