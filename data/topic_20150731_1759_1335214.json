{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nFirst off, thank you for the awesome open source tool and all the support you've rendered!\n\n\n\nMy question: I have been using Ladybug to calculate solar radiation for a base case window and then the solar radiation reduction with different shading types. Everything seemed to be working great until an engineer compared the values I was getting with the values she calculated (same geometry and weather file (Mountain View, CA) for June 21st all 24 hours) using IES. I'm attaching my grasshopper definition (geometry internalized), the weather file I'm using and an excel file showing the solar radiation values (highlighted) from both IES and Grasshopper. I assume that Ladybug's calculation process has been vetted and compared to other known procedures/methods, so can anybody shed some (sun) light on what's going on? The engineer would like to know how the solar radiation is calculated, I assume with radiance, is this correct?\n\n\n\nAlso, when I set the analysis period on June 21st from 15hr - 16hr and from 16hr - 17hr the Ladybug_Radiation_Analysis component gives the nebulous error message: \"1. Solution exception:index out of range: 12\"\n\n\n\nThank you in advance,\n\n\n\nDustin\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1335211", "name": "USA_CA_Mountain.View-Moffett.Field.NAS.745090_TMY3.epw"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1335212", "name": "shading_study_test_case.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1335213", "name": "IES and Grasshopper Comparison.xlsx"}], "created_by_name": "dustin", "created_at": "July 31, 2015 at 05:59PM", "created_by": "dustin836", "topic": "Ladybug solar radiation results don't agree with IES Virtual Environment 2014...", "id": "topic_1335214"}
