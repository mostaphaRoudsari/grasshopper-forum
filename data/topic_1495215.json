{"body": "\nHello guys and girls,\n\nI am getting really god at crashing rhino lately. So I am asking you for a little bit of help. I am doing a test to see if the location of different zones affects the energy outcome (thesis project) but when I put just the second level in - approx a total of 80 zones in total - it crashes when it should calculate the glazing. However it does it for the first 40 zones (first level) but not when I add the second level. So I am really puzzled to why is that - are there any settings I am skipping?\n\n\n\nAny crazy ideas are more than welcomed! I have added the definition for who wants to take a peak. ;)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SNF651yU0cXd6KOVTeDNFl5PMA9mxppXTgDzF-xDb0lUuMiwOSGyUmCuK8WDf9m64JqAAZ4zPN2vwUb8RsWiYtgU0bCUJtZ4/snitrhinoerror.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SNF651yU0cXd6KOVTeDNFl5PMA9mxppXTgDzF-xDb0lUuMiwOSGyUmCuK8WDf9m64JqAAZ4zPN2vwUb8RsWiYtgU0bCUJtZ4/snitrhinoerror.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1495214", "name": "29-03-2016.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Stefania Dinea", "created_at": "March 29, 2016 at 5:34am", "created_by": "StefaniaDinea", "topic": "Glazing - rhino crash", "id": "topic_1495215"}
