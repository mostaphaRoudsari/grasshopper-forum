{"body": "\nHi community,\n\nI am trying to optimize form of a building which has some zones and intersects walls. When I change the height of a zone which has some walls in common with other zones, the Honeybee_IntersectMasses dosen't work any more. So how can I change the height of that zone for finding the best one?\n\nThanks,\n\nEhsan.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ehsan Fouladi", "created_at": "September 15, 2017 at 05:48AM", "created_by": "EhsanFouladi", "topic": "Honeybee_IntersectMasses issue", "id": "topic_1813505"}
