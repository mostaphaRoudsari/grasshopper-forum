{"body": "\nYasin and Abraham,\n\nI am sorry for coming so late to the discussion and thank you, Abraham, for taking care of practically all of the issues thus far. \u00a0You are truly the community guru :)\n\nThe issue with the\u00a0HB_srfDataByTypeDetailed was a bug that I have just fixed in the attached file. \u00a0Thank you for finding it.\n\nI noticed that the GH file had some issues caused by having certain components in front or behind each other on the canvass in the incorrect sequence. \u00a0This type of issue can usually be fixed by selecting the components that should be run first and hitting \"Cntrl +B\" and I think that I have fixed this in the attached file.\n\nThe issues with a mis-match between Rhino model tolerance and internalized geometry tolerance are, unfortunately, things that we don't know how to work around yet (I feel that the Grasshopper team at McNeel should put in a check for this when opening a GH file where this could happen). \u00a0In the meantime, I commend your instinct in checking the tolerance, Abraham.\n\nWhen we get to the next stable release, I will put up a video on syncing with the github since I have realized a lot of people want to do this.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1318531", "name": "02postlsimulationKAITsimulationBUp_AY2_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 30, 2015 at 8:04pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1317367", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1318529"}
