{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nYou are probably tired of this, but i've found another issue with the list of low/high bounds in the legendPar component.\n\nIn the last example you uploaded both axis start at -10 and end at 30. The scales look correct for the data, but the text on the axis is not.\n\nI tried to play with the list values but with partial sucess. The values i gave were: -10,0,0,0 for the lowBound and 30,500,500,500 for the highBound. But then one of the temperatures is plotet wrongly.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 6, 2015 at 9:37am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1339272", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1339512"}
