{"body": "\nYihong,\n\nThe only platform that comes to mind that allows you dynamic editing of the energy simulation while it's running is [MLE+](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mbehl/mleplus.html). \u00a0The learning curve is very steep, though and I would not recommend it unless you already have a background in coding and understand the IDF file format (also, Matlab is very expensive). \u00a0What control strategy are you using that requires you to account for all 4 states? \u00a0Also, what results are you trying to obtain? \u00a0Energy use? Thermal comfort? \u00a0It's a bit hard to tell from your list of simulation software there.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 01, 2017 at 04:04PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1682669", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1682858"}
