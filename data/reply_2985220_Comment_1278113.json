{"body": "\nThank you Abraham for your quick answer. It was helpful to understand about HB_readComforResult components.<br/>And now it works perfectly on the small building masses. However, increasing the number of breps cause some issues on HB_Indoor View Factor components.\n\nThe error message:\u00a01. Solution exception:need more than 0 values to unpack\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vlKUFPodnGWSWz5OUtlOdiqVp2PAecCRHe4jQzMadJGu8Dlw0d7dCira*Iq6K-cgZKfzuDFRMlY0oA0vrEw-krSkB9IZH4ON/2.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vlKUFPodnGWSWz5OUtlOdiqVp2PAecCRHe4jQzMadJGu8Dlw0d7dCira*Iq6K-cgZKfzuDFRMlY0oA0vrEw-krSkB9IZH4ON/2.jpg)\n\n[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vlKUFPodnGXKQT8tcLGSigFAUjsfDziHx9zKamsEPjIgZBypTWOiCaT4PrXdzSRdpVty6lmPyTuv-I5u9O*W8-98vM9KDW72/Canvasat103012.png)\u00a0In this case what could be the proper solution? I am wondering if my building mass is too much to handle. It consists 90 breps and 5 floor office building.\n\nI am uploading the file with disabled most of the components inside to load easily.\n\n\n\nAnd one more thing to ask. If update the HB &amp; LB components using the LB_update and HB_update, do I have to re-insert everything again or some certain components have to be drag &amp; dropped? <br/><br/>Best Regards.<br/>Awkweird\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1278115", "name": "Honeybee_issue_2015_05_01.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 10:14pm", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1276935", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1278113"}
