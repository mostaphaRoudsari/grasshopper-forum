{"body": "\nHi Chris and thanks,\n\nI'm preparing a proper answer to yours :-)\n\nI believe this is one of the cases where bad inputs lead to bad results (in other words: garbage in garbage out).\n\nThere is no way that you get such high temperatures in this climate conditions. But i'll send this later on.\n\nIn the meantime, i find those graphs very enlightening!! Very cool way of understanding what you are doing (or i'm doing). Though i can't reproduce all of them specially the total heat gain and net flow. Can you send the example where you get them?This will be very helpful for me (and others maybe) and to prepare, and justify my answer.\n\nThanks again,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 27, 2015 at 9:34pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1212646", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1212755"}
