{"body": "\nHi,\n\nFor some reason my browser doesn't attach it properly. I'll try again here.\n\n\n\nYes I did update HB and LB but then all the tests after didn't work. Apparently 1 brep works in the simulation, but the moment I add another one to the HBZones it fails.\n\nThe error is : \"Solution exception:index out of range: 0\"\n\n\n\nHopefully the attachments are correct now.
