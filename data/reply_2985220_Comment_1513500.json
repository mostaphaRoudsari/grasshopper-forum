{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nYes, I think it is a good idea. I attached a file where you can see the function. It is not perfect yet, but I think its method\u00a0is very interesting. I think Rhino 5 has some issues with boolean union functions, because sometimes it doesn't work with some lists of curves or surfaces, but if you try to change the order of elements and then repeating the function, it works.\n\nAnd this is basically what my function does. However, sometimes it is very slow or it could go to an infinite loop when the solution is almost impossible. For this reason I wrote a limit condition inside the loop.\n\n\n\nIf you want and you are interested in it, you could work on this method.\n\n\n\nBest <br/>Antonello\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1513502", "name": "merge_function_antonello.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "April 22, 2016 at 3:27am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1512057", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1513500"}
