{"body": "Mahsa,\n\nI had never heard of ASE until you posted this question and I googled it. To be clear, is this what you are referring to:\nAnnual Sun Exposure (ASE) describes how much of space receives too much direct sunlight, which can cause visual discomfort (glare) or increase cooling loads. Specifically, ASE measures the percentage of floor area that receives at least 1000 lux for at least 250 occupied hours per year.\n\nNormally, to account for glare potential over the whole year, I run studies with the Ladybug sunlight hours component and support my interpretation of it with simulations of daylight glare probability (DGP) using Honeybee glare analysis.\n\nAt first glance, I am a bit skeptical of this ASE metric. Is there any documentation on why they chose 1000 lux? It seems fairly arbitrary and not consistent with what I have heard from experts about minimum lightnlevels needed to experience glare (~4000 lux).\n\nWhile I say that you should use this metric at your own risk, you can calculate it with the \"Read Anual Daylight Result II\" component and set the threshold at 100 lux.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 13, 2015 at 04:48PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1400028", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1399992"}
