{"body": "\nYes, Abraham, this is exactly the problem I encountered. Apologize that I didn't explain it clearly in my original post.\n\n\n\nFollowing your advice, I did some more tests:\n\n\n\n1. If the **mass2Zone** component is not imported in the workflow, there is no problem for the **intersectMass** component, no matter how we change the random seed to generate different groups of breps with overlapping surfaces:\n\n\n\n2. However, once we add the **mass2Zone** component into the workflow, we have this problem as posted here.\n\n\n\n3. As you pointed out, the warning is given when \"Hzones == True\" which only happens when one of the objects in _**bldgMassesBefore** is recognized as a **zone** already stored in **HB Hive**. So, I added one line after line257 to **print out the zone name:**\n\n**[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/M-kC1yhXlFKuHJCuaIbeLw9PcMf2mn2jnwXhDIt0AiZ85GJBbjCal0q1256gt0ObWF1x0hUn1IEmNf*zcRw09rtPinPelyoz/Image16.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/M-kC1yhXlFKuHJCuaIbeLw9PcMf2mn2jnwXhDIt0AiZ85GJBbjCal0q1256gt0ObWF1x0hUn1IEmNf*zcRw09rtPinPelyoz/Image16.png)**\n\n\n\n4. It seems for the cases that the intersecMass component shows warning, there is a zone name printed:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/M-kC1yhXlFJKIj68zKgVbqOT-cKxjXIz39eXjulo3POHnwbYr*a*XsXPulJ82ysW0*u2hPsnmeo7gsA5OHcNvt4eT5xExpqI/Image20.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/M-kC1yhXlFJKIj68zKgVbqOT-cKxjXIz39eXjulo3POHnwbYr*a*XsXPulJ82ysW0*u2hPsnmeo7gsA5OHcNvt4eT5xExpqI/Image20.png)\n\n\n\n5. Whereas for those cases that the intersecMass component shows no warning, there is no zone name printed:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/M-kC1yhXlFKfGG1c0lvMP6YhNMXPaaoYs8qAvNoNmCB4XVtdgoZ6*tDXWwpGNCs7P7Y9QHXzD4pe7Ioy3BK79sek4WQfGT2R/Image21.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/M-kC1yhXlFKfGG1c0lvMP6YhNMXPaaoYs8qAvNoNmCB4XVtdgoZ6*tDXWwpGNCs7P7Y9QHXzD4pe7Ioy3BK79sek4WQfGT2R/Image21.png)\n\n\n\n6. Even if the **zone creation is turned off**, there is still zone name printed for cases that intersectMass is unable to process:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/M-kC1yhXlFKAh-HeimLN7ml5cKn58ZpYQyyjwXYXIc1m81fxJZhwk559KUrfZvSeK2GEE8DGfZ4itMpxLNpry1bX58HfN3NF/Image22.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/M-kC1yhXlFKAh-HeimLN7ml5cKn58ZpYQyyjwXYXIc1m81fxJZhwk559KUrfZvSeK2GEE8DGfZ4itMpxLNpry1bX58HfN3NF/Image22.png)\n\n\n\nSo, I agree with you that this might be related to the **HoneyBeeHive** which stores honeybee zones.\n\n\n\nMaybe whenever upstream geometries change that are connected to either intersectMass or Masses2Zones, the HoneyBeeHive has to be cleaned up and zone objects inside need to be recreated.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHope Chris and Mostapha can kindly take a look and advise if this is the source of the issue.\n\n\n\nThanks.\n\n- Ji\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1740640", "name": "intersectMassissue_v02.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "April 27, 2017 at 03:32AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1740534", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1740639"}
