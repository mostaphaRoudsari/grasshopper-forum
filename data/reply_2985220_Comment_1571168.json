{"body": "\nThank you Chris I will look at the OSM files. When I've built 90.1-App-G models by hand the fan power is the tricky bit. The model has to be run twice. First time to obtain AHU air volumes used for fan power calculation. Calculated fan powers are entered into the model and it is re-run. I will see what the fan power assumptions are in the OSM files, since that fan power process is probably not yet included and automated.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Arpan Bakshi", "created_at": "July 26, 2016 at 2:23am", "created_by": "ArpanBakshi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571102", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571168"}
