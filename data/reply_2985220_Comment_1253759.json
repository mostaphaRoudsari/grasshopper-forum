{"body": "\nJulien,\n\nI just re-read your original comment and my response and realize that I was not so helpful. \u00a0I am sorry about that.\n\nI am afraid that you are going to have to use trial and error to find the surface that you want glazing on if your glazing surfaces are custom with the AddHBGlz component. \u00a0If you can get the window geometry that you want with the Glazing Based On Ratio component, this component will only create windows on surfaces that are exterior so you could build up your zones, solve adjacencies on them, and then run them through the glazing based on ratio component to ensure that only the non-intersected surfaces get glazing.\n\nI hope that this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 31, 2015 at 5:49pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1249295", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1253759"}
