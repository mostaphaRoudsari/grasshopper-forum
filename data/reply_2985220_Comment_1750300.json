{"body": "\nChris,\n\nFirstly, I would like to thank you for your informative webinar on microclimate analysis yesterday.\n\nRegarding the problem in question I'm inclined to believe that it is not a system issue since both yesterday's street example and another very quick test I did on the same machine ran fine. It may have to do with:<br/> (i) either improper geometry generation, as I already intersected some of the common surfaces manually in sketchup and then did the rest with the intersect masses tool.\u00a0 E+ throws an error about 2 surfaces that do not calculate insolation properly which I have yet to detect. The updated honeybee openstudio component even refused to provide the resulting in.csv file address although one was generated (it returned null instead although the old one would be ok).\n\n(ii) or perhaps an issue of mix and matching old and new hb components, which is just speculation till now.\n\n\n\nTwo other issues I detected:\n\n1)\u00a0 When using the PET recipe, MicroclimateMap produces the following error: Solution exception:global name 'PETComfMtx' is not defined. This happened on yesterday's street gh definition I tried to play with.<br/><br/>2) In both UTCI and PET recipes: the description of cloAbsorptivity that appears on rollover is misleading as it refers to radiation reflected off of the ground. I suppose the description in the code for clothingAbsorptivity_ is the correct one.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n-Aris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aris V", "created_at": "May 12, 2017 at 10:48am", "created_by": "ArisVartholomaios", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749454", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1750300"}
