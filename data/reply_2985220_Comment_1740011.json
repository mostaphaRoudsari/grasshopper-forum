{"body": "\nOkay, in that case the problem is that your model for the louvers is too geometrically complex for it be run with standard Honeybee settings. While it is possible to run this model in Unix using higher settings for octrees and then rtrace, it is perhaps too complicated to do the same thing inside Honeybee.\n\n\n\nMy suggestion to you would be to simplify the geometry for the louvers by removing the number of faces.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "April 25, 2017 at 6:09pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1739188", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1740011"}
