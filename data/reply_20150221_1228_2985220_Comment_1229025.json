{"body": "\nHi Theodoros,\n\n\n\nThanks for your response, I checked each individual zone over and over again to make sure they are closed but I still have the same problem. So I decided to just make my building as a one zone building, it is an open plan office building anyway, and I made sure it closed , I used the custom preview component to visualize the zone and looks fine, and still having the same issue. I'm attaching the file that has that one zone. The zone is grouped with orange background. is anyone here in this forum willing to troubleshoot the issue. I think I'm going crazy, I've been up since last night trying to make this work .Thanks in advance.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1229027", "name": "Base_caseHB3.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "February 21, 2015 at 12:28PM", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228661", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1229025"}
