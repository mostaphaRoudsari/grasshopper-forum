{"body": "\nThanks Leland, I am working on it to find out the problem,\n\nbut it seems that I have paid attention to all the matters you said, but cooling load and total thermal energy is much high in this location (Tehran/Iran) and is not comparable to light energy, so we can not find a appropriate WWR in which light is equal to thermal load. the algorithm says the smaller the window, the less energy use!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Fahimeh Motazedian", "created_at": "August 29, 2015 at 12:30pm", "created_by": "FahimehMotazedian", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1351232", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1351134"}
