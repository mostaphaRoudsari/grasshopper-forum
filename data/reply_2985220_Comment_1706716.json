{"body": "\nHello Abraham,\n\n\n\nI am trying to understand how many hours of daylight for each month are in the space.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo for example, I am trying to determine the size of a trellis based on the amount of daylight the space gets and the shadow range of the trellis. So if the trellis covers the deck at a depth of 20' there is no need for the trellis to be 30' deep. So I want to be able to study this relationship and more importantly I want to be able to justify it with based in the numbers given by ladybug. I want to be able to say this area of the deck is not occupied by people so it does not have to be shaded and this area gets X amount of hours of daylight in the month of June.\u00a0\n\nI hope that makes sense.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "March 6, 2017 at 2:14pm", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1706524", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1706716"}
