{"body": "\nHi Chris and Mostapha, sorry for the late reply. I've been busy at work. I tried connecting the \"WriteRAD\" and \"RunRAD\" to the same boolean toggle as you suggested, and that seems to work. Thanks!<br/><br/>Brute Force seems to require more than one slider as an input, while runItAll only requires one slider to run, so in that case RunItAll is better for this particular case. :)<br/><br/>It always great to see how quickly you respond! Thank you for that. Looking forward to the next update!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "\u00d6rn Erlendsson", "created_at": "October 23, 2014 at 11:13AM", "created_by": "OErnErlendsson", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151643", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1154567"}
