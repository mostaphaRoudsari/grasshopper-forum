{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nI know why this happens and I will say that it is intentional but I also think that it might as well be a bug since I have seen so many people mess this up (including myself in the public videos that I put up) such that I think we should change it.\n\nThe Mass2Zone component has traditionally required you to input a full list of values for the zoneProgram, the zoneNames, and the isConditioned, that matches the length of the zoneMasses list. \u00a0However, everyone who uses this component expects to be able to plug in a single value for the zoneProgram and have it apply to all of the connected zones.\n\nAccordingly, I have just re-written the component and posted it to the github. \u00a0The component will now assign the zone program to all zones when a single value is connected and, if you plug in a longer list of values that does not match the length of the zoneMasses list, the component will give you a warning to let you know that it is assigning a default zoneProgram, zoneName, or isConditioned value.\n\nThis is such a serious issue that I think it merits changing all of my example files and changing this component in the userObjects folder at the app.box link. \u00a0I am going to do this now.\n\nThanks for reporting this, Abraham. \u00a0I had known about the issue but the full magnitude of how serious it is did not hit me until you posted.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 18, 2014 at 4:31pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151351", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151444"}
