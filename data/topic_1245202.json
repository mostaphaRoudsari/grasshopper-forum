Based on the image that I have attached, can anyone tell me what might be the problem. Mostapha, I copied this component from the file you sent us (I couldn't even find the component myself). If I click it, it seems to run multiple runs and\u00a0saves multiple\u00a0folders, but I cannot get them to read.\n\nAppreciate it!\n\nSaurabh\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1245201", "name": "runitall.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Saurabh Shrestha", "created_at": "March 18, 2015 at 8:43pm", "created_by": "SaurabhShrestha", "topic": "Run It All", "id": "topic_1245202"}
