{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\n\n\nI have been thinking about this and was waiting for someone to ask for it so I go ahead and implement it. Interesting that no one ever asked about this!\n\n\n\nCheck the attached file. There are two components that let you dump the objects to a file and load them back from the file. In this case once you have a large model already worked out you can save it and next time load it from the file. I have tested it for small models but let me know how it will work on a large model.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/g3YV6mxuqstxebks1d4ejdgfC3Edp-zTpmLxsGBrUu4yg-EoRXDlVGadzAG9x8V6UdWA7zAkIPOq*qUCh3akEUk6v5BqU7w2/dumpLoadHBObjects.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/g3YV6mxuqstxebks1d4ejdgfC3Edp-zTpmLxsGBrUu4yg-EoRXDlVGadzAG9x8V6UdWA7zAkIPOq*qUCh3akEUk6v5BqU7w2/dumpLoadHBObjects.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1455964", "name": "dumpObjects.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 5, 2016 at 8:11pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1455604", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455962"}
