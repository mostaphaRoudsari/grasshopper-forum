{"body": "\nClaudia,\n\nGlad that you figured it out and that you found the discussion related to CHKBHS.\u00a0 For anyone following this thread, you can find CHKBHS answers here:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interior-so...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interior-solar-distribution-calculation)\n\nFor accurate sub-zone results, Claudia, I would usually recommend breaking up a geometry as complex as your\u00a0 building into several zones with air walls between them.\u00a0 Your current model will give you decently accurate values for your overall building loads, though.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 15, 2015 at 11:07AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1421759", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1421933"}
