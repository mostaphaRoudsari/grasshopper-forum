{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nIf I add them to the custom library the addtoEPlibrary component will say it was succesfully added but then\u00a0it wont appear in the\u00a0callfromEPConstructionLibrary component. If I refresh the updatehoneybee component it will work just setting the data to the setEPzonecnstr, but I wanted to do a brute force run so I am assuming that after the first one the custom materials wont work. Also the solve adjacencies is not working properly. Not sure if the attached file will work.\n\n\n\nThanks for your help and time!\n\nBlanca\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1345406", "name": "Block C.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Blanca Dasi Espuig", "created_at": "August 19, 2015 at 04:31AM", "created_by": "BlancaDasiEspuig", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1345211", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1345405"}
