{"body": "\nHello Djordje,\n\n\n\nI am using your tool to analyse a pv installation on the roof of a high rise building. Works like a charm and gives all results. However, I have 11 different surfaces as my pv system that I am inputting to the components. The results come out one for each of the surfaces, along with a big number of sunpath shading graphs (I imagine for each). Is there a way to sum these up? I mean I can, and I am, manipulate the data structures when it comes to results. However, I was wondering if we can get a cumulative sunpath shading. Now that I think about it that wouldn't make much sense. Would it be possible to get different (coloured?) patches on a sunpath shading for each surface?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "July 22, 2015 at 1:33am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1309523", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1330373"}
