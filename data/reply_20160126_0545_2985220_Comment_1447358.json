{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI have been using Pollination with no problem at all and is great but when I shift to DesignExplorer although the numerical results appear normally the manual URLs I input from my DrobBox folder cannot be read. I only get the URL back in place of an image/3d model. If I replace my links with the links of the file from the examples then I get back images and 3d models. Any idea why this is happening? Has anyone tried it already successfully?\u00a0\n\n\n\n-Tasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 05:45AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "topic_1443436", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447358"}
