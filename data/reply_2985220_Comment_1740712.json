{"body": "\nHi Chris, I (or a colleague in a more favourable time zone!) will be attending next weeks presentation on Dragonfly for sure.\n\nThe registration page suggests that the tool is currently being developed for climate change and morphing of the weather files to account for this.\n\nIs this correct? and if so, do you mind me asking what methods are being looked at for this?
