{"body": "\nDevang,\n\nThank you very much.\n\nI'll run the galapagos tonight because I'm afraid that it takes too much if I do it right now.\n\nYou're absolutely right, I put the name \"glare potential\" in order to differentiate the gradIndex that I used.\n\nWhat if I want to make a glare analysis optimization [cd/m2]? Is it enough to link the fitness to the DGI as in the figure?\n\nIs it better, for this purpose, to use galapagos or octopus(I've never used it but I read it is really efficient)?\n\nI know I'm asking a lot of questions, sorry.\n\nThank you,\n\nCarlie\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1672930", "name": "gala2.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Carlie_3", "created_at": "January 16, 2017 at 5:08am", "created_by": "Carlie_3", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1672755", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1672929"}
