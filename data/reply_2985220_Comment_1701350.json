{"body": "\nHi Alejandro,\n\nI never had this issue but since uninstalling them doesn't solve the problem I doubt if it has to do with Ladybug and Honeybee. I think Grasshope once had a similar issue and David helped him to solve the problem. I assume this is something that David should be interested to check and fix.\n\nKeep us posted on the results.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 27, 2017 at 7:17am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1701410", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701350"}
