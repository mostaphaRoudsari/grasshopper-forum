{"body": "\nOk. So that worked, but now I'm getting this error in the runDaylightAnalysis component:\n\nRuntime error (MissingMemberException): 'list' object has no attribute 'X'<br/>Traceback:<br/> line 105, in getsurfaceStr, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/> line 183, in RADNonPlanarChildSurface, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/> line 1041, in main, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/> line 1509, in script\n\nIt's particular to the curved surfaces, I think, as a cube works just fine. I dug around in the script a little, and it looks like at one point the \"coordinates\" parameter of getsurfaceStr is passed a list of four points by RADNonPlanarChildSurface rather than one. Those four points are at the corners of one of the curved windows. I stopped digging because I'm not really sure how everything works in there.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Trygve Wastvedt", "created_at": "July 08, 2014 at 10:40AM", "created_by": "TrygveWastvedt", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1099001", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1099214"}
