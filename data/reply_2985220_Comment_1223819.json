{"body": "\nHello Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to look into this once again.\n\n\n\nI want to reply with an example of the potential workflow, but the GenCumulativeSkyMtx is giving me a fatal error so I can t run the GH.\n\n\n\n(I don t mean replicating the Mapdwell, I just reference it as an example of possible assumption inputs regarding costs, type of PV, frame or not, or anything else (I currently lack the knowledge on the subject) that someone would need to vary in order to estimate PV related outputs: returns, payback cycles etc. The input geometry will be our designed in Rhino PV surfaces, with Radiation values calculated from LB).\n\n\n\nAny suggestions for this error? When I have this running I will send a GH regarding the PVs.\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1223821", "name": "cumulativeSkyMtx_Error.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "February 12, 2015 at 3:32pm", "created_by": "doompop", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1222677", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223819"}
