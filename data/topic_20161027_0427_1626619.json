{"body": "\nHi fellow nerds.\n\nI have come onto an issue these last few weeks. The last couple of times I have opened GH, all of the **Ladybug and Honeybee components have been removed from the ribbon**, however, the panels still appear!\n\nThe wired thing is that I can still call on all of the LB/HB components, double-clicking the canvas. My old scripts also still work fine.<br/>(However, as I am still rookie to LB/HB, I'd like to access the components the old-fashioned)\n\nMy other custom packages and GH native componets are there just as normal. (However, I have never actually used these)\n\nI use custom layout, hiding some packages I don't need right now.\n\n\n\nI've tried to uninstall LB+HB using the Remove Ladybug+Honeybee script and reimport all of the components. Nothing happens.<br/>However, the component files are removed from the folder i drag-n-dropped them from (don't know if that is normal procedure).\n\n\n\nI hope you guys can help me here.\n\n\n\nGH:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/e1LP62WPF9-Hz3ACIQng3BfdW4Xw17mu6Iat7BdwOmx5QT*K*RnndkBsxW4Aq678pd9fVsOCws0XBMehYYoBgwEoYkLcuBPi/LBHBdisappear.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/e1LP62WPF9-Hz3ACIQng3BfdW4Xw17mu6Iat7BdwOmx5QT*K*RnndkBsxW4Aq678pd9fVsOCws0XBMehYYoBgwEoYkLcuBPi/LBHBdisappear.png)Explore (The components are gone after importing/drag-n-drop'ing them to GH canvas):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/e1LP62WPF98JYYseVlk5Bna0tOSbg2zQRvcxgDVjevrPwOwxOxJyQDLSts7QifOK2oUG4PxsOGrCCkGcMzAWny-1lI2ZujU9/LBHBdisappearfiles.png\" width=\"747\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/e1LP62WPF98JYYseVlk5Bna0tOSbg2zQRvcxgDVjevrPwOwxOxJyQDLSts7QifOK2oUG4PxsOGrCCkGcMzAWny-1lI2ZujU9/LBHBdisappearfiles.png)p.s.\n\nRegarding the uninstall file. It includes a 'RemoveHB' component and a toggle to set to True here. It does, however, also include another small script that requires file addresses. Is this important for the uninstallation?\n\n\n\n- Lasse\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lasse Hamborg", "created_at": "October 27, 2016 at 04:27AM", "created_by": "LasseHamborg", "topic": "LB+HB components keeps disappearing from GH UI", "id": "topic_1626619"}
