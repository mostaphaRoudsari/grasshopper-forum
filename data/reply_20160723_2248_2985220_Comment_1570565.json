{"body": "\nDear Chris, thank you!\n\n\n\nThe following might be what I did previously:\n\n\n\n1. There are a few default weather files for USA cities in the In the C:\\EnergyPlusV8-4-0\\WeatherData folder. So, I put the Singapore EPW file there, only the EPW file, not the DDY and STAT files for Singapore downloaded from energyplus.net.\n\n\n\n2. After opening the GH demo file posted earlier, I select this Singaproe EPW file and run the simulation using the Run EPlus Simulation component.\n\n\n\n3. I got the error, and a new DDY file of Singapore was generated in the same folder where the EPW file is put which is the \"shortened\" DDY one I posted above. So, this shorter ddy file was generated in the process while the error was happening.\n\n\n\nHowever, I have to admit that I **cannot reproduce the error** and the \"shortened\" DDY file for Singapore in the scenario described above any more, strangely ....\n\n\n\nSo, maybe I shall pause my question here until I identify the situation to reproduce the error.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, may I confirm with you that the **EPW, DDY and STAT** files for a particular city shall always be put together in the same folder just as those in the C:\\EnergyPlusV8-4-0\\WeatherData folder?\n\n\n\nThank you, again!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "July 23, 2016 at 10:48PM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570553", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570565"}
