{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI think there is an error in the component description of RTRadiationAnalysis. Hovering over radiation result gives units of 'Wh/m2'.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/XnAxcylq3ih3JwtAfno9bDZpRlkZkY5cHzhIugt9-Go5HjMi1eDeaCp9NcM21TT0OS-I*oDP1G6tSCxb1f2eNZoHozLc*hlY/ladybugerror.png\" width=\"674\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/XnAxcylq3ih3JwtAfno9bDZpRlkZkY5cHzhIugt9-Go5HjMi1eDeaCp9NcM21TT0OS-I*oDP1G6tSCxb1f2eNZoHozLc*hlY/ladybugerror.png)However, the magnitude of results being outputted from this component seem far too small to be in Wh/m2. Should it be kWh/m2?\n\nAs a comparison, the output 'radiationOutput' in component 'radiationAnalysis' returns values in kWh/m2 too, which is why I think it should be kWh/m2 in both components.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James Ramsden", "created_at": "May 15, 2015 at 07:49AM", "created_by": "JamesRamsden", "topic": "Error in radiation component description", "id": "topic_1287465"}
