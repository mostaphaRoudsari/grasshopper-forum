{"body": "\nOk, let me answer myself:\n\n\n\nmaybe the approach should be the other way around:\n\n1. create the wall surface without opening and the coplanar window surface that are ready for thermal analysis in the first place\n\n2. use ****region difference**** and ****boundary surfaces**** components to generate the wall surface with opening for window, if this is needed in situation such as daylight simulation in which wall surface and window surface can't overlap.\n\n\n\nAm I correct?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cxNDsYnHlWTcTLEUeK7qrAHlKRy5Ux4cKQvaAlBfpvq1tiws416baAeHUnJmm8rwsl6gSpSZWKZDCutXPoSS1gwDgfqXSXGb/06.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cxNDsYnHlWTcTLEUeK7qrAHlKRy5Ux4cKQvaAlBfpvq1tiws416baAeHUnJmm8rwsl6gSpSZWKZDCutXPoSS1gwDgfqXSXGb/06.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1340216", "name": "open brep _v02.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 08, 2015 at 07:37AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "topic_1339980", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1340214"}
