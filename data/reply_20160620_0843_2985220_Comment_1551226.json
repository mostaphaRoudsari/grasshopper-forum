{"body": "\nHi Pin,\n\n\n\nApologies for the delay in my reply, I was away over the weekend\u00a0\n\n\n\n1) This is indeed a bug and one I am aware of I need Mostapha's help to fix this since you are using the component. See:\u00a0[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/487](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/487)\n\n\n\nDo you need this functionality ASAP?\n\n\n\n2) This is also a bug, however that one is a quicker fix, see a working component attached, please use the newer version of the component and check out the E+ wind turbine guide for the difference between analytical and simple turbines\n\n\n\n[http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-4/input-output-reference/gr...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-4/input-output-reference/group-electric-load-center-generator.html#generatorwindturbine)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1551227", "name": "WindGenerator_error AS 20.06.2016.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "June 20, 2016 at 08:43AM", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1549722", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1551226"}
