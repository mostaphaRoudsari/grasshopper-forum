{"body": "\nYou are right, I am kinda comparing apples and oranges. The weather file is not the same. The project is in Guangzhou, but Ecotect only has a file for Hong Kong. It isn't that far, but still. So in Ecotect I used the weather for Hong Kong, in Ladybug I used the weather for Guangzhou. I am also not sure how Ecotect and Ladybug take samples of the surfaces and how face normals play into that. \u00a0Just last week I started testing with solar shading devices and Ladybug's results tend to come out better. They look like something we might expect in real life. I am simplifying to a one bay of the office tower and I will do the tests again and will share the results.\n\nThanks again for responding and your help!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ilya Bourim", "created_at": "July 27, 2014 at 8:15pm", "created_by": "IlyaBourim", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1105783", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1107193"}
