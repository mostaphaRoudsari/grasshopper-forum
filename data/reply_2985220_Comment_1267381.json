{"body": "\nHi Fillippo,\n\nGreat to know that you found a way to fix the first issue. For the second part if you can be more specific I think there are solutions such as replacing the string and re-running the analysis. Check the attached file for an example where I replace fraction radiant.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/HMrNkLH2ZKNNYnz94R9iaCsjGgWsUM0Y7WWuq03XAw8qAkRGk*w2qKLz2cFXF3dWvNS-vR8Q4xA5cxkFnz23aaUrx9IBx0lU/modify_idf_file.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/HMrNkLH2ZKNNYnz94R9iaCsjGgWsUM0Y7WWuq03XAw8qAkRGk*w2qKLz2cFXF3dWvNS-vR8Q4xA5cxkFnz23aaUrx9IBx0lU/modify_idf_file.png)\n\nI know it is somehow a pretty hacky solution but should solve your problem until we find some time to address the issue in a more sophisticated way.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1267382", "name": "modify_idf_file.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 19, 2015 at 5:51pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1261819", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1267381"}
