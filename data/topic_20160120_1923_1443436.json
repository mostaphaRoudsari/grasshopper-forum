{"body": "\nHi All !\n\n\n\nI'm playing around with the capabilities of honeybee to create different idfs and run them parametrically. With a set of 300+ different idfs and simulations created by Honeybee, I want to analyse the spaces based upon their Thermal Autonomy values and their Daylight Autonomy values.\n\n\n\nHowever, calculating TA and DA require the HBObjects to be re-input into the components to be read, which can be automated, but make it an extensive process to get objective values out of the various simulations... bit difficult to explain the process which needs to be done to get the analysed results out.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how you might be able to conduct a sensitivity analysis on all simulations run to determine which parameters are the most influential to a given objective (ie. TA and DA)?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 20, 2016 at 07:23PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Sensitivity Analysis within Honeybee", "id": "topic_1443436"}
