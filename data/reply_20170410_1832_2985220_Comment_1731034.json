{"body": "\nOrcun,\n\nI wasn't able to recreate this issue in your file but I know that this generally happens because the component changes it's inputs depending upon the connected _naturalVentilationType. \u00a0If the component doesn't find the right input, the component will not run and just produce a null. \u00a0If the component ever gets stuck like this, just disable and enable the component and all should work smoothly.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 10, 2017 at 06:32PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1731010", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1731034"}
