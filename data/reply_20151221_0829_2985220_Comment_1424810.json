{"body": "\nHi Luigi,\n\n\n\nBased on the report the analysis is running fine on your system. You may run out of memory with this setting.\u00a0Setting aa to low values can be very computationally expensive. Do you really need to set aa that low? Here is a good reference for Radiance Parameters: ([http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/rpict_options.html](http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/rpict_options.html))\n\n\n\nAlso check this discussion:\u00a0[http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/0...](http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011160.html)\n\n\n\nI added an error.log file to Honeybee daylight analysis with Radiance and it will hopefully give you a more meaningful error report if you try the attached file.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1424812", "name": "ModelForhoneybee_2_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 21, 2015 at 08:29AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1424254", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1424810"}
