{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI modified a bit Mostapha's example:\n\n1. One of the zones was \"open\". This was becouse a number of windows were duplicated for the same zone. I deleted those windows and now all are closed (see white circled group for this).\n\n2. Was thinking why not to simulate just one point instead of simulating the whole grid and then choosing one of them for the following steps. So i did it getting the center point of each zone. See bottom group.\n\nHope this helps a bit.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1647408", "name": "integrateddaylightandenergy_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 28, 2016 at 11:13AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647148", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647406"}
