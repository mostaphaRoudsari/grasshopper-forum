{"body": "\nErik,\n\nI was able to recreate the situation that you are talking about:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fA3fM7bX7uJGLd0bbHHL2-6f101uJLmMx2TXGEzAWaUnAlx2aPyFyfLrzR1xgWuuMJRyuGIOuAq-WX-vgjqOfJGB9eOfIjuY/SimultaneousVentAndHeating.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fA3fM7bX7uJGLd0bbHHL2-6f101uJLmMx2TXGEzAWaUnAlx2aPyFyfLrzR1xgWuuMJRyuGIOuAq-WX-vgjqOfJGB9eOfIjuY/SimultaneousVentAndHeating.JPG)\n\nThe reason for this is that your zone volume is very small (3x3 meter cube) in comparison to the operable area of your window (~1.1 square meters). \u00a0So, when you open the 1.1 square meter operable area in the middle of winter, the zone cools down so fast that you instantly shut the windows in the next timestep and start heating. \u00a0In other words, you simulation does not have simultaneity heating and ventilation but it is unstable to the point that it is opening/closing the window every 10 minutes and turning the heating system on/off every 10 minutes.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of different ways to fix this:\n\n1) You can still have the windows open in winter but you use an openingAreaFractionalSched_ to ensure that the windows only open a small crack in the winter months so that you don't overcool the zone. \u00a0So you could make a CSV schedule that has a 1 value for all summer months but maybe only a 0.25 for all winter months.\n\n2) Alternatively, you can add in a minOutdoorTempForNatVent_ that ensures that natural ventilation never happens when the outdoor temperature is very low. \u00a0Typically, occupants will not open windows when outdoor temperatures are below 12 C and plugging in 12 to this input might help. \u00a0I would say that you could go up to a 15C \u00a0minOutdoorTempForNatVent_, given that your climate is fairly warm.\n\n3) You could increase the timestep of your simulation so that the windows are only opening for 4 or 5 minutes instead of 10 (on the Energy Simulation Par component). \u00a0While this might fix the issue, it's probably not realistically how a building would behave in real life.\n\n3) You could reduce the operable area of your window. \u00a0As I suggested earlier, it's a bit oversized for such a small zone. \u00a0Alternatively, if your zone were deeper, the operable area would be more reasonable in relation to the zone volume.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 6, 2017 at 5:08am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1744734", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1746525"}
