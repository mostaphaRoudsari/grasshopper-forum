{"body": "\nThanks Chris,\n\nDo you mind attaching the file you used for the simulation? I'm trying again and i'm getting a COMPLETELY different range of values comparing with yours and between LB and HB. So probably i'm doing something wrong and i don't get what.\n\nI tried to reduce the influence of the bounces defining materials with 0 reflectivity.\n\nAs for the second point, i agree, and also was suspecting, i'm dealing with a memory issue. But for this specific case i'm interested not in interiors but exteriors and only radiation (not lighting). That's why i selected all the building ... Wondering if there is a way.\n\n-A.\n\n\n\nP.S. I see that you used a different weather file than i did. Please use [this one](http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata/2_asia_wmo_region_2/CHN_Hong.Kong.SAR.450070_CityUHK.zip). Using your i'm getting your results, which are good. Using the one i said you get 2.6 in LB and 100 in HB(!!!). So there is a big possibility this file has wrong data??!!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 09, 2015 at 09:54PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1376484", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1376407"}
