{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\n\n\nI'm doing some experiments with the Daylight Factor Simulation component to calculation time and results sensibility to radiance parameters. I'm feeding it with custom radParameters as seen below:\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" height=\"473\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cWUzdktWeMsBtn78vC7JKJL1My4w56m0Y7qFPWAz9RoZJbWE*-2Kx7mHz7LJEu5QJpAdX8a2eoy7ExB6R3t76bDRiZy7GEC6/Capture_RadParameters2.JPG?width=750\" width=\"527\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cWUzdktWeMsBtn78vC7JKJL1My4w56m0Y7qFPWAz9RoZJbWE*-2Kx7mHz7LJEu5QJpAdX8a2eoy7ExB6R3t76bDRiZy7GEC6/Capture_RadParameters2.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comand prompt window (see attached image) seems to put -ad 1000 as default even if it seems to be set to 512 in grasshopper. In contrast to -ad, the modification of -ab to 3 has been taken into account.<br/><br/> Have you set minimum values for RADparameters? If yes, would it be possible to force them to custom values?\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cWUzdktWeMsAcfzUSuyszaW8NePp9oDLE2*0M9OtqzoueNwqu9NJOTsm7bQDeW5GwV1Od2daj-24l-ntVrYR2nB8n4g-aJ9U/Capture_RadParameters.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cWUzdktWeMsAcfzUSuyszaW8NePp9oDLE2*0M9OtqzoueNwqu9NJOTsm7bQDeW5GwV1Od2daj-24l-ntVrYR2nB8n4g-aJ9U/Capture_RadParameters.JPG)\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for your help\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\nAymeric\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aymeric", "created_at": "November 14, 2016 at 4:45am", "created_by": "AymericDELABACHELERIE", "topic": "Honeybee RAD parameters", "id": "topic_1638984"}
