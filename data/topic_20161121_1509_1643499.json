{"body": "\nIs it possible to quantify a gain in kWh for a solar PV array that is in fixed position over an array that is on a retractable armature? I am looking to see if there is any significant benefit to investing into a system that would track Sun throughout the year, vs just doing a fixed panel system.\u00a0<br/><br/>I think the rule of thumb is that a fixed system gets roughly 70% of available sun vs. a system that can track sun would allow to collect 100%. I am not sure how that translates to actual dollar amounts so I would like to do a study to prove/disapprove this rule.\u00a0\n\nAny suggestions would be welcome. Cheers!\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "konrad k sobon", "created_at": "November 21, 2016 at 03:09PM", "created_by": "konradksobon", "topic": "Retractable (operable) PV panel study", "id": "topic_1643499"}
