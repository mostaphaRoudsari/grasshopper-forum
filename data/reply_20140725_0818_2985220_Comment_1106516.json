{"body": "\nHi ,\n\nYou can gather the vectors to each skypatch by drawing a vector from (0,0,0) to the centerpoint of each skypatch (output by the ladybug skydome module). Measure the incident angle between each skypatch and the normal of your target surface. You can then use the equation I*cos(@) (I = skypatch radiance, @ = incident angle) or the dot product between the two unit vectors * the skypatch intensity to gather the irradiation on the surface expected from each skypatch. These\u00a0are the values you use to scale and color your vectors.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo visualize your cactus\u00a0try the SDL line component. Use the patch center point as the start input, the skypatch vectors as the direction input, and a length scaled by the calculated irradiance value. These lines can be colored with the script you already have set up and previewed using the custom preview module. The \"Human\" plugin has a great module that will allow you to change the color and thickness of the lines.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou could also make a cone or some other shape based on the start point, vector direction and calculated value\u00a0but using Breps may slow it down too much. These could be colored using the custom preview component. Good luck.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "July 25, 2014 at 08:18AM", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "topic_1106163", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1106516"}
