{"body": "\nEnergyPlus has a daylighting engine. \u00a0It's not as accurate as Radiance, but it's much faster. \u00a0I would guess that the Daylight Threshold should be connected to daylight dimming of the electric lighting load. \u00a0The simplest way to do this is with the DAYLIGHTING:CONTROLS class. \u00a0You can find the description of it on page 391 of the I/O Reference. \u00a0I'm copying the variables for this class below for your reference. \u00a0It really only requires a minimum of two inputs from the user: a point (x,y,z) where the daylight sensor should be placed and the illuminance threshold.\n\n\n\nHope this helps...\n\n\n\n!- =========== ALL OBJECTS IN CLASS: DAYLIGHTING:CONTROLS ===========\n\nDaylighting:Controls,<br/> Zone 1, !- Zone Name<br/> 1, !- Total Daylighting Reference Points<br/> 0.441765, !- X-Coordinate of First Reference Point {m}<br/> 5.133972, !- Y-Coordinate of First Reference Point {m}<br/> 0.762000, !- Z-Coordinate of First Reference Point {m}<br/> , !- X-Coordinate of Second Reference Point {m}<br/> , !- Y-Coordinate of Second Reference Point {m}<br/> , !- Z-Coordinate of Second Reference Point {m}<br/> 1.0, !- Fraction of Zone Controlled by First Reference Point<br/> 0.0, !- Fraction of Zone Controlled by Second Reference Point<br/> 300, !- Illuminance Setpoint at First Reference Point {lux}<br/> , !- Illuminance Setpoint at Second Reference Point {lux}<br/> 1, !- Lighting Control Type<br/> 0.0, !- Glare Calculation Azimuth Angle of View Direction Clockwise from Zone y-Axis {deg}<br/> 22.0, !- Maximum Allowable Discomfort Glare Index<br/> 0.3, !- Minimum Input Power Fraction for Continuous Dimming Control<br/> 0.2, !- Minimum Light Output Fraction for Continuous Dimming Control<br/> 1, !- Number of Stepped Control Steps<br/> 1.0; !- Probability Lighting will be Reset When Needed in Manual Stepped Control\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Burin", "created_at": "March 11, 2015 at 11:06pm", "created_by": "Burin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240868", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240809"}
