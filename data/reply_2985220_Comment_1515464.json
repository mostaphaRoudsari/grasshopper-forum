{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\n\n\nMostapaha and I had a discussion about this issue a couple of days back. We are working on expanding the capabilities of Honeybee by moving towards matrix-based calculation methods.\n\nBoth Daysim(inside Honeybee) and DaysimPS rely on the daylight-coefficient method which offers almost no potential for incorporating complex shading systems. Any new DaysimPS-related development that we undertake at this point is likely to be redundant within this year.\n\nI had used DaysimPS extensively for my MS Thesis work so I have some idea of what it is all about. You are welcome to contact me at sarith@sarith.in with questions/clarifications if you plan to use it with it's java interface.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "April 23, 2016 at 8:26pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1513164", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1515464"}
