{"body": "\nThanks Chris that's fantastic. You guys are so speedy!\n\n\n\nAs an extension to this, I have another problem which I'm sure you have already come across. How do you generate view points? For example, if I have the Sydney Opera House that I want to evaluate, I could mesh it, extract vertices and use these as the input. If I don't include the building as context, it essentially becomes transparent making all points visible which is not correct. However, if I do include the building as context, the maximum points visible will only be 50% as half will be on the back face. So again, this skews the results because it is impossible to see those points in the first place. So what I think is needed, is a cull of all view points so that only those that are possible of being viewed are analysed. If all of these can be seen, then the result is 100%. Is there a Ladybug component for this already or do we need to generate this ourselves?\n\n\n\nAlso, clearly the meshing of the brep is important if we are extracting its vertices. I notice that Ladybug has a neat feature that when it generates the analysis mesh it is roughly the mesh grid size imput. This is significantly better than GH's native mesh brep component. Where is this function located - in Ladybug Ladybug or View Analysis? I would like to expose it to help solve the above issues.\n\n\n\nThanks again!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul Wintour", "created_at": "March 21, 2016 at 04:23PM", "created_by": "PaulWintour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489644", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489687"}
