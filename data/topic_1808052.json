{"body": "\nHi Community\n\n\n\nI have a strange problem regarding interior surfaces when I run energy simulation via Openstudio ..\u00a0\n\n\n\nI modeled an atrium which has adjacency with multiple zones and when I add interior windows between adjacent surfaces I get errors like in the picture attached below.\u00a0\n\nIn unmethours.com I could understand as the atrium is unconditioned and the other zones are conditioned, adjacent surfaces somehow get confusion to be part of the energy modeling or not .. however, when I condition the atrium again I get the same error ..\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat are the possible solutions?\u00a0\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nAmir\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1808051", "name": "Untitled.png"}], "created_by_name": "AMIR TABADKANI", "created_at": "September 3, 2017 at 2:12am", "created_by": "AMIRTABADKANI", "topic": "OpenStudio Run Error!", "id": "topic_1808052"}
