But file-2) on the other hand initializes in 1 second and simulates for 3 minutes or so and gives perfect results.\u00a0\n\nThe reason i suspect **non-planarity** to be the reason of slowing down the simulations is simply based on some my own assumptions.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kristoffer Negendahl", "created_at": "November 17, 2014 at 6:05am", "created_by": "KristofferNegendahl", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1170232", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1170237"}
