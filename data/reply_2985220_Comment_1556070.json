{"body": "\nChris,\n\nThanks a lot for your answer.\n\nI'm ok with the meaning of 'Sum' value. So you confirm that default setup for mechanical ventilation is 'no mechanical ventilation' when using the Ideal Lodas Air System in HB ? (Outdoor Air Flow per Person = 0 AND Outdoor Air Flow per Zone Floor Area = 0).\n\n\n\nI still have doubts, because when adding \"Zone sensible Heating Rate\" as output, I get non-null results. (I thought \"Zone Sensible Heating Rate\" was directly related to the Outdoor Air Flow)\n\n\n\nMarc\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marc Lotteau", "created_at": "June 27, 2016 at 12:51am", "created_by": "MarcLotteau", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1555777", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1556070"}
