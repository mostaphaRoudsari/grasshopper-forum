{"body": "\nI've been working with DesignExplorer and encountering some of the same issues I've seen other people are struggling with. Here's what I found:\n\n1. Files had to have at least 61 runs - no idea why but otherwise I'd get the img and threeD text strings coming in as inputs/outputs (see below)\n\n2. I could use dropbox but I had to repalce [https://dropbox.com/](https://dropbox.com/) with [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/) and delete the \"?dl=0\" from the end of the link . Supposedly this creates a \"directly downloadable file\". It's also the format from the DE sample file.\u00a0\n\n3. The ftp hosting (from Tasos) worked for my images but not for my json files.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'd be curious to see if anyone else has struggled loading json files that are hosted on an ftp site. I'd prefer the ftp method to dropbox because copying dropbox links is tedious. \u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/aF4MSt0XX0UARmKco09Il11M-hiVLLmtDvJIS6H8d91c0HfhNFZ8GfplUKFqRDn6EReyZqn2OAvnhccooue5e0rHI5kPQmFh/DE_notworking.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/aF4MSt0XX0UARmKco09Il11M-hiVLLmtDvJIS6H8d91c0HfhNFZ8GfplUKFqRDn6EReyZqn2OAvnhccooue5e0rHI5kPQmFh/DE_notworking.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lizzie Adams", "created_at": "March 01, 2016 at 02:03PM", "created_by": "LizzieAdams", "parent_id": "topic_1417543", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1475132"}
