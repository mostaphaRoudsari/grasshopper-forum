{"body": "\nHi Melissa\n\n\n\nYour test surface is divided into test points from your _gridsize input. Each of these test points has the ability to experience each of the\u00a0744 sunlight hours in June. In this instance the ones with red are going to receive direct sunlight not more than 329 times and the ones in yellow 164.5 times which is due to your geometry blocking out the direct sunlight.\n\n\n\nAdding up the legend to get total hours is incorrect. You have to look at the test points individually. Perhaps a good way would be to think of it as percentages of the 744 total possible hours.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "March 6, 2017 at 4:09am", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "parent_id": "topic_1704248", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1706165"}
