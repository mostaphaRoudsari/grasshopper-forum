{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI am a beginner in Grasshopper and Ladybug and Honeybee that are really nice plugins. Now, I face some problems when I tried these files.\n\nQuestion 1_For the 004_gridBasedAnalysis (old version):\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What is the source of length of the results?\n\nQuestion 1_2_For the 004_gridBasedAnalysis (new version):\n\nThe result would change when I changed the opening ratio in step 7, but it would not change when lower or higher the opening ratio in step 6. Therefore, I am confused of the work of index for opening ratio in step 6.\u00a0\n\nQuestion 2 _For illuminanceAnalysis\n\nI would like to attach customized geometry for window, so I tried this file.\n\nQuestion 3_For Shading for daylighting\n\nAbove all, I would like to analyze different geometry of fenestration systems, such as special louvers or perforated screens, so I would like to attach those complex geometry to daylight analysis. When I went through the workshop video on youtube, I guess those analysis is mainly based on glazing, so I am still confused that how I can connect different geometry of fenestration to Ladybug and Honeybee. Is there any example file that shows analysis of perforated screen or similar design?\n\nThank you so much for your reply.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1143722", "name": "Question files.zip"}], "created_by_name": "HUI-LING CHANG", "created_at": "October 06, 2014 at 12:50AM", "created_by": "HUILINGCHANG", "topic": "Questions for gridBasedAnalysis, illuminanceAnalysis and Shading for daylighting files", "id": "topic_1143723"}
