{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI was testing the parametric daylight analysis example file from GitHUB that uses the Ladybug_fly component to generate multiple results files, and i want to know if there is some way to bring all those results at once to grasshopper. In the example file there are only 20 results and it is possible to copy each result file path manualy to grasshopper, but with more results it becomes impraticable.\n\n\n\nThank you all\n\nAllyson Santos.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Allyson Carvalho Silva Santos", "created_at": "September 26, 2016 at 8:56am", "created_by": "AllysonCarvalhoSilvaSantos", "topic": "How to read multiple results from Ladybug_fly ?", "id": "topic_1605873"}
