{"body": "\nHi Chris, Claudio,\n\nI'm trying to do the same thing as you, Claudio. I have a highly reflective facade that bounces rays of the sun to an opposing restaurant. I already made a direct sunlight hour analysis to see what times of the day there are reflections. The thing is that it is hard to asses if those reflections are 'annoying', so next up I made a radiation study using the honey bee daylight simulation.\u00a0\n\nThe point I want to get at is to find the UTCI (universal thermal climate index) for a person sitting right in front of the restaurant where the rays hit. Here is where I'm stuck as I'm not quite sure how to use the radiation results (kWh/m2) I got from the honey bee daylight simulation. I know I need to use the ladybug outdoor solar temperature adjustor and the ladybug outdoor comfort calculator. I'm just not sure how.\n\nBelow is an exaggerated image of what i'm trying to achieve as proof of concept let's say. The parabolic shape would be the mirror facade (it is flat in reality I'm just exaggerating to see if the honeybee simulation worked) and the mannequin in front is the test person that receives the radiation.\u00a0\n\nAttached is the accompanying grasshopper file\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bGawF3RRkacUfa-6-yHLu5ZEbXAsmJcck24J2MhtM*j7EFohsZHo4rgYjeZl6Fr2PGHpXyaKlHJyNU-g*y0WIpqo*KsEMlJL/05.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bGawF3RRkacUfa-6-yHLu5ZEbXAsmJcck24J2MhtM*j7EFohsZHo4rgYjeZl6Fr2PGHpXyaKlHJyNU-g*y0WIpqo*KsEMlJL/05.jpg)\n\n\n\nYour help is greatly appreciated\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nArie\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1346460", "name": "ComfortableAnalysis_v1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Arie-Willem de Jongh", "created_at": "August 20, 2015 at 3:41pm", "created_by": "aw", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1237865", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1346458"}
