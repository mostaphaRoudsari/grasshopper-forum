{"body": "\nHi Antonello,<br/><br/>Not really. Initially I've planned to use only the _origin point and its elevation (the central point from the \"Terrain Generator 2\" component) for visibility analysis. So basically the visibility would always be calculated starting from that point (that's the photo on the left, below).<br/><br/>But you have just discovered a new way of choosing a custom point! Thank you for that! (that's the photo on the right):<br/><br/>\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/sncWs2jh2LJsk7MDXFbVx18hTDZK6eUP4hq4Fgc7TQxZS2CQBz-MPPPPeeG9RYp0n-LOie7IcrQc5M3mdrmphRhnCyjJIgJ6/terrainAnalysisVisibility.jpg?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/sncWs2jh2LJsk7MDXFbVx18hTDZK6eUP4hq4Fgc7TQxZS2CQBz-MPPPPeeG9RYp0n-LOie7IcrQc5M3mdrmphRhnCyjJIgJ6/terrainAnalysisVisibility.jpg)\n\nBy the way, the Visibility legend coloring scheme in \"Terrain analysis\" component had a bug, which is visible on the last photo you attached. I waited for us to settle the origins input/output name before fixing it. The\u00a0[newest version of Terrain analysis](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/pull/300) has it fixed. I also added text to _terrain, _origin, and _elevation docstrings suggesting the usage of \"Terrain Generator\" component data as well.<br/><br/>Also, try setting the \"refine\" input to \"True\". It will increase the quality of the final analysedTerrain mesh.<br/><br/>Once again, thank you Antonello for the useful support and collaboration!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "October 06, 2016 at 03:00AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1611056", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1611964"}
