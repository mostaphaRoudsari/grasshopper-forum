Pollination is the first part of a series of web-based developments for Ladybug+Honeybee to explore possibilities for better data visualization.\u00a0[Pollination](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/tree/gh-pages)&lt;Vis&gt; in particular is designed for exploring multi-dimensional data.\n\n\n\nThe idea of\u00a0[Pollination](http://honeypatch.github.io/pollination/index) born at the [AEC-TECH Hackathon](http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-technology-symposium-2014/aec-technology-symposium-2014-hackathon/)\u00a0last year. I want to\u00a0thank all the [team members](http://honeypatch.github.io/pollination/team)\u00a0for the great original work. Also many thanks to [Kai Chang](https://github.com/syntagmatic) for developing [ParallelCoordinates](https://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/)\u00a0library for [D3JS](http://d3js.org/). Creating Pollination would be very very hard without his development.\n\n\n\nHere is a very short video that shows how you can interact with data and load your own files. As you can see in the video I added to components to Honeybee that helps you generate an structured .csv file from Grasshopper. You can also generate the files manually.\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"420\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OgdPaAgpOcQ?wmode=opaque\" width=\"420\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n\nThe data doesn't need to be results of Honeybee or Ladybug. Feel free to use pollination for any other studies including your multi-dimensional optimization cases!\n\n\n\nOK! That's all I have for now. Check the webpage [here](http://mostapharoudsari.github.io/Honeybee/Pollination)\u00a0and the source code on [github](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/tree/gh-pages).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: If you are interested in data visualization and multi-dimensional data then I strongly recommend you to watch this presentation by Kai.\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"560\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypc7Ul9LkxA?wmode=opaque\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 5:06pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "topic": "[New Development] Pollination for exploring multi-dimensional data", "id": "topic_1229503"}
