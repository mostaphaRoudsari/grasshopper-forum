{"body": "\nHello HB+LB community,\n\nI am following the Shading Benefit example on Hydra ([http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Energy_Shade_Benefit&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)) for a project.\n\n\n\nI was having compatibility issues so I decided to upgrade most of the components to Honeybee 0.59. However, now I get an error that states:\n\n\n\n\"1. Solution exception:global name 'shadeType_' is not defined\"\n\n\n\nI noticed that the version 0.58 has an input for the shadeType_ but it's no longer available in 0.59 so I'm not sure how to get it functioning.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nJustin\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1495627", "name": "EnergyPlus_Simulation_wShading.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Justin Shultz", "created_at": "March 29, 2016 at 11:13AM", "created_by": "JustinShultz", "topic": "Global variable ShadeType_ not defined when using Honeybee 0.59", "id": "topic_1495628"}
