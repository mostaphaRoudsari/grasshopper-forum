{"body": "\nI've noticed that E+ is able to accept precipitation schedules based on the EPW precipitation data. It then uses this to account for when the building walls are wet, which changes the film coefficient.\n\n\n\nI'm located in the tropics and precipitation is quite high, with rain coming every day. I wonder if anyone has ever used this method before.\n\n\n\nI know E+ has a precitipation schedule for the US ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/develop/datasets/...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/develop/datasets/PrecipitationSchedulesUSA.idf)) and the official site briefly describes how to develop one. But still the file is thousands of lines long.\n\n\n\nI wonder if there is a way we can write precipitation schedules from the open epw component in HB/LB? And if then we can use them as inputs to the precipitation object of E+. I would love to investigate the impact of this in results.\n\n\n\nI apologize beforehand if such an option already exists in HB/LB, or if this whole process isalready taken intoaccount in normal simulations.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I now wonder if this is already taken care of when we link the weather file to the run energy simulation component.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 04, 2016 at 12:16AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Developing and using precipitation schedules with HB/LB", "id": "topic_1429949"}
