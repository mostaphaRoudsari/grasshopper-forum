{"body": "\nHi Moein\u00a0,\u00a0\n\nmy Master's case study needed to evaluate the thermal &amp; ventilation performance of a certain kinetic\u00a0facade which was designed by another architect. So I used the honeybee energy simulation to get the zones temperature &amp; ventilation rate,\u00a0As I had no choices to evaluate the natural\u00a0ventilation \" there was no butterfly plugin yet \u00a0\". So I depended on the ventilation rate by the facade movement and the amount of air needed inside the building's zones every hour to optimize\u00a0the best facade movement every hour of the day. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nI hope that can help you, but I'm pretty sure that butterfly can help you more.\n\n\n\nMona \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "December 26, 2016 at 9:36am", "created_by": "monarezk", "parent_id": "topic_1662832", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1662776"}
