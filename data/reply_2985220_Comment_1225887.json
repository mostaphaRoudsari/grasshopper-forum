{"body": "\nI'd like to add something relating to curved surfaces in Energy Plus.\n\n\n\nIs it me being a novice or are these results odd? It seems that the zone with the curved surface (west zone) has the highest average temperature which seems quite logical especially since this is a simulation with shades that were NOT created for that surface. But it also seems to have, along with the other curved surface, the lowest glazing surface heat gain. Could it be that the offseting creates odd results or is this normal?\n\n\n\nThese are results from the previous definition.\n\n\n\nSorry, not yet so experienced in energyplus.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1225888", "name": "AverageSurfaceTemperature_perspective.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1225889", "name": "GlazingSurfaceEnergyLossGain.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 16, 2015 at 9:20pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1225657", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1225887"}
