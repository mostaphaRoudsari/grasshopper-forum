{"body": "\nCould you explain that a bit more?\n\nThe way the component currently works uses the gridSize input to specify overall mesh edge lengths, created within the viewFactor component. I assume this is then used to create a mesh and obtain face centre points from which the view factor is calculated.\n\nI'm wondering if there's a way of providing the actual mesh, or a list of points from which the view factor could then be determined.\n\nSomething like how snappyHexMesh creates an adaptive mesh around components for CFD - where finer resolution is required as opposed to large areas of the domain where there's no need for such fine mesh.\n\nIs there another method I might have overlooked?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tristan Gerrish", "created_at": "June 30, 2017 at 05:55AM", "created_by": "TristanGerrish", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1776718", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1776548"}
