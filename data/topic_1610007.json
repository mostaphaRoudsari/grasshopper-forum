{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm performing thermal comfort analysis for some project.\n\nI'm trying to migrate from using the\u00a0runEnergySimulation component to exportToOpenStudio as recommended by Chris.\n\nComparing the results from using the same setting for both options i get different results. So i'm assuming that the exportToOpenStudio is adding additional default values. Otherwise i can't explain the differences, that sometimes are significant.\n\nAttached a couple of images showing the issue.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1610005", "name": "runEnergySimulation.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1610006", "name": "exportToOpenStudio.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 3, 2016 at 11:13pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "[Solved] ExportToOpenStudio vs runEnergySimulation - Results differences", "id": "topic_1610007"}
