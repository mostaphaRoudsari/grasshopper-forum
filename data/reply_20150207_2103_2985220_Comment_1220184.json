{"body": "\nHi Anastasios,\n\nWhat Chris suggested is the first thing that also came to my mind but I suggest you to send this question to EnergyPlus mailing list or unmethours website ([https://unmethours.com/](https://unmethours.com/))\u00a0and let us know if you got any better solution. I think being able to overwrite the the boundary condition of a surface is something that is worth to apply to honeybee in general. I'm not sure if you can do that in EnergyPlus though.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 07, 2015 at 09:03PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1219198", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1220184"}
