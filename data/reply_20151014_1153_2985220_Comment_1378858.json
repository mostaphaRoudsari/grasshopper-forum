{"body": "\nThanks Chris,\n\nIn the meantime i've been doing some tests with the Shadingmask component just to compare results with the VSC's. So far no good correlation. The differences are pretty big, sometimes beyond 15-20%.\n\nBeing the SVF a completely geometrical calculation (no sky influence) i was hopping the results will be in the same order of numbers (also played with the resolution of the Shadingmask but no improvement). Makes me think that maybe the -ab = 1 in the VSC is the cause. So maybe for SVF this parameter should be set to 0, as Leland said ...?\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 14, 2015 at 11:53AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1378604", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1378858"}
