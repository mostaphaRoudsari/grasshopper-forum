{"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\nThank you for getting back to me so quickly. I am using WIP. Would 0.9.0076 be a stable release? When I try running ladybug on v0.9.0076 I get the error `1. Solution exception:Method not found: 'System.Reflection.MemberInfo[] Microsoft.Scripting.Generation.CompilerHelpers.FilterNonVisibleMembers(System.Type, System.Reflection.MemberInfo[])'.`I posted a question about this on the forum some time ago and since have been in touch with McNeel tech support too but it seems that there's no fix. I found it worked in WIP though. Is there a way around this that you can suggest please? The sunpath component was working fine when I first downloaded the WIP.\u00a0\n\nMischa\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mishmash", "created_at": "February 3, 2017 at 10:43am", "created_by": "mishmash", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1684464", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1684370"}
