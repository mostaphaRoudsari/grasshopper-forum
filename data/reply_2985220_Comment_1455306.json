{"body": "\nHi Tasso,\n\n\n\nDo you mean you managed to import typical glazing with Window+BDSF? I think I've managed that as well. But yes, the problem in this case is that there is nothing in the database of Window for ETFE. For my part, what I did was a very simple custom radiance material in HB, using quite high numbers of transmittance (smth ETFE is famous for?).\n\n\n\nI'm lucky enough to be doing outdoor studies so I mostly care about shading of an area almost 30m below. In which case I'm assuming small impact by modeling them as a simple radiance surface. Sorry I can't help more. I will look into it in the future, perhaps I am lucky and I am able to drill some info out of a supplier.\n\n\n\nI also did not use Mostapha's method since it involves a number of custom made components and radiance functions I don't have the time to learn now. However, I was wondering if anyone has modelled ETFE as simple radiance materials to see if I'm close.\n\n\n\n@Mostapha\n\nFor the printed pattern I used intermediate panel surfaces made from Lunchbox and made them opaque (for the first test). Is this crude method anywhere close to what you're doing? :) Is it smth I can use for a simple outdoor radiation study?\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 5, 2016 at 6:47am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455344", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455306"}
