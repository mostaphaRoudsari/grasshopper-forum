{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nExcellent question. \u00a0We have historically not been able to run THERM directly from Grasshopper because the Command Line Interface (CLI) version of THERM has not been free. \u00a0However, the wonderful scientists at LBNL have changed this policy with the release of [THERM 7.5](https://windows.lbl.gov/software/therm/7/index_7_5_9.html)\u00a0and it seems they are gradually working towards an eventual open source version of the software.\n\nI have had the implementation of the THERM CLI in Honeybee\u00a0[on my agenda for a few months now](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/issues/618)\u00a0and you have given me a good reason to get it done. \u00a0I will try to implement this soon and I will post back here once it is ready. \u00a0Once this is in place, you will be able to parametrically generate THERM files and automatically run them through THERM to get the results.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 11, 2017 at 09:26PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1730805", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1731677"}
