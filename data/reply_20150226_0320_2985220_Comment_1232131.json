{"body": "\nHi Guys!\n\nI've read all this discussion, which is very helpful.. But I still have a huge question: how to combine the \"solar constraints\" with habitability (or, if you prefer, functionality)? I'll try to explain myself with an example:<br/><br/><br/>\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8KNI8B2SjT3TbZ1HTgWlLX6VeXCLL6JnnX3Dh-jXTyDC96DQm3Ngb868FyYzmaMeTmRG2rp-kpne4vbCwuDttG08yUERNHP6/Schermata20150226alle10.59.56.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/8KNI8B2SjT3TbZ1HTgWlLX6VeXCLL6JnnX3Dh-jXTyDC96DQm3Ngb868FyYzmaMeTmRG2rp-kpne4vbCwuDttG08yUERNHP6/Schermata20150226alle10.59.56.png)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8KNI8B2SjT2st-DEBW2R5WU738hkzwiTjxFLas8M66nlhQWF9-ebsMD*t79qzbpyGR0rx68yrkI*D3RleA0sobgG4D3pfMkq/Schermata20150226alle11.18.05.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/8KNI8B2SjT2st-DEBW2R5WU738hkzwiTjxFLas8M66nlhQWF9-ebsMD*t79qzbpyGR0rx68yrkI*D3RleA0sobgG4D3pfMkq/Schermata20150226alle11.18.05.png)\n\n\n\nHere you can see my case of study (which is Fort Point District... I think I understand that Chris is from Boston). As you can see the shapes deriving from the Gh def. are considerably smallar than the buildings around.. But I need to obtain buildings at least of 5-6 storey.. and the ones that you see here are just 1 or 2 storey tall.\u00a0<br/><br/>Obviously, reducing the amount of imputs (such as a minor number of months or days), the solar envelope would be taller.. So, according to you, what is the way to find a good balance between constraints and functionality?\u00a0\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leonardo Roli", "created_at": "February 26, 2015 at 03:20AM", "created_by": "LeonardoRoli", "parent_id": "topic_969681", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1232131"}
