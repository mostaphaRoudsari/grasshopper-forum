{"body": "\nRaina,\n\n\n\nYou ask this question at a good time as Mostapha and I are in the process of making the components more amenable to applications such as this. \u00a0Whatever the final workflow we end up suggesting, I am confident that it will involve setting up sliders to run through design spaces for cases like yours. \u00a0So setting up the slider and a list of views should be relevant to your situation no matter what.\n\nAnimation of sliders works but you can also use the \"Fly\" component to run through all of the combinations of multiple sliders.\n\nI think we will add in an option soon to run energy / daylight simulation components all of the way to generate all files (possibly including batch files) but just not execute them. \u00a0This way, you don't have to close out of the window each time.\n\nWe will also write something to execute all of the files for you but this part may vary depending on the parallel processing platform used. \u00a0In any case, your logic about 100 batch files on a 100 CPU computer makes sense as long as the operating system of this computer knows to run each batch file on a separate thread (which I imagine it does but I haven't worked too much with supercomputers yet).\n\n\n\nStay tuned and I will let you know when we add in the option to generate all files from the simulation components.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 04, 2016 at 07:21AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1576412", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1576490"}
