Even when I just use one single box brep from the test file.\n\nYou said it might have something to do with duplicate surface names, could you point me to how I can diagnose and bug fix this, as I'm unsure about what's going on in the backend of things?\n\nBest,\n\nMax\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DLAtIY7YVfKsKTn1Z*blav2zFCZ1nnZP9w8gTIVRWH5wAsPA-Xkq-kgYNaltDtnIhgcX4Rg6Yp5m3JMSu0EI*bnRM9if1K9y/kaputt.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DLAtIY7YVfKsKTn1Z*blav2zFCZ1nnZP9w8gTIVRWH5wAsPA-Xkq-kgYNaltDtnIhgcX4Rg6Yp5m3JMSu0EI*bnRM9if1K9y/kaputt.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Max D", "created_at": "July 27, 2016 at 01:38AM", "created_by": "ButWhyprecisely", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1566896", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571593"}
