{"body": "\nOk. Windrose component reads _analysisPeriod_ or assigns a default value for that.\n\n\n\nI like the way you use annualHourlyData_ input for this.\n\n\n\nTo move forward on this one, the way I see it, there are two ways;\n\n1. We implement HOY input for this component similar to what Mostapha has done for Ladybug_SelectSkyMtx. This is ofcourse if you, Chris, and Mostapha agree.\n\n\n\n2. If you and Chris come to an agreement on a method, we could think on how to reflect the same on the analysis period displayed in the Title Text (The text below a windRose).\n\n\n\nIn any case, I would be happy to get involved.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "February 02, 2017 at 02:45PM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1683046", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1683940"}
