{"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n\nIt is that formula or a variation of that formula depending on context. For example in DaysimPS, the final step in calculating illuminance is something like: /C c:\\daysim\\bin\\rcalc -e \"$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3;$4=$4*47.4482686+$5*119.950519+$6*11.6012125\"\n\nwhere the values of (47.44,119.95,11.60) are in the same ratio as (0.265,0.67 ,0.065).\n\n\n\nCIE (or IES) calculations for lighting are focused on brightness based calculations and tend to disregard spectral information (which in the case of Radiance is just RGB) in favor of a single number. The calculations that are done in Radiance on Daysim in this regard are in line with the\u00a0[Trichomatic Color Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichromacy) and the concept or Long, Medium and Short range [cone cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell) in the eye.\n\n\n\nThere is some discussion on this in the Radiance forum: [http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/...](http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007644.html). (V-lambda or Y luminance curve or Photopic efficiency function are one and the same).\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 12, 2016 at 03:04PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1528987", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1529413"}
