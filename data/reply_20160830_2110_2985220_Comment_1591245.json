{"body": "\nHi Mona,\n\nThat is a \"secret\" (or rather poorly documented) feature in the IES luminaire component. You can copy and paste the contents of a IES file directly into a text box and make it work (instead of assigning the path) as I have done in my file. Did that answer your question?\n\n\n\nBy the way, I found a tiny bug in the code while working on your file. I have requested Chris to update. It might be that you were getting errors due to that bug.
