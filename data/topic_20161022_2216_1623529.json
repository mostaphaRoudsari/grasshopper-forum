{"body": "\nHey Guys,\n\n\n\nI am having difficulty in getting a result from ReColorMesh. I have attached its image. The error is: Solution exception:gradientColor() takes exactly 5 arguments (7 given).\n\n\n\nI have heard that it can be because of version of honeybee but my honeybee version is not old and I have recently installed it. I do not know what is the problem.\n\n\n\nCan somebody help me?\n\n\n\nMitra Sajjadi\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1623528", "name": "pm4.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Mitra Sajjadi", "created_at": "October 22, 2016 at 10:16PM", "created_by": "MitraSajjadi", "topic": "problem with recolourmesh", "id": "topic_1623529"}
