{"body": "\nOk, there was one HBsurface missing. Now the simulation runs.<br/>However the illuminance analysis shows exactly the same results, with or without the shading mask, even when the sun is very low.\n\nMaybe the mask is placed too far from my geometry to show noticeable results.<br/>I'm wondering how does it decide where to place the mask (given that I put no input data as context_ in the TerrainShadingMask element).\n\nIs it actually placed in such a way to give the same shading effect as the real terrain geometry?\n\nThanks for the answers!\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-UOsCXDQFwGR5-3Vic3r5YbncZgEfnz75dHHrkfg*-hPodE4AQxMWvfPTvG*jibloGUlvMUbFydEfOXym7uCzVy8XynPHK*y/Cattura.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-UOsCXDQFwGR5-3Vic3r5YbncZgEfnz75dHHrkfg*-hPodE4AQxMWvfPTvG*jibloGUlvMUbFydEfOXym7uCzVy8XynPHK*y/Cattura.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giacomo Luddeni", "created_at": "July 30, 2016 at 9:20am", "created_by": "GiacomoLuddeni", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1573224", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1573716"}
