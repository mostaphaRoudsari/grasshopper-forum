{"body": "\nHi! Interesting discussion.\n\nI'm about to implement a clustering solution using octopus E, some excel writers/readers and Flux.io.\n\nEach generation of chromosomes is going to be pushed to the cloud through Flux.io where the slave computers reads it and simulate the parameters contained in the chromosomes. Will try to make some function to distribute these values in the cluster so that there are no two machines calculating the same input and so that as one simulation is complete the corresponding chromosome is taken away from the list and instead input into a list of solutions. In a subsequent step, when the list of solutions is full, these values are fed to the genetic algorithm, mutated and crossed over into a new set of chromosomes to be checked and the circle continues.<br/><br/>Maybe Im stating the obvious here. Or being naive in my intentions. :) Though Flux.io was not very well known when the posts here were written.<br/><br/>Best of luck and please share your progress, and Ill let you know how my system works out.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "April 13, 2016 at 2:50am", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1387061", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1507661"}
