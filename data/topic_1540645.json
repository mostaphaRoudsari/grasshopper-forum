{"body": "\nPardon me if I've been asking a lot of questions lately..\u00a0\n\nAnyone with the same error?\n\nI didn't report this initially because at first I tried using the Psych Chart on my i3 laptop so I thought my laptop might be the issue.\u00a0\n\nHowever, I'm on an i7 desktop now so I couldn't help but wonder why it would crash on a simple Psych chart.. any help? I made sure I was on the latest version of LB/HB, I even set the analysis period for only one month just in case.\n\n<br/> [<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"330\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/n8UsK9SRM-XGpwQolEcf6SjX7yk2b8SHNLDTfOI94g13OVQSrtTkIRL6AjlV2e2FeMf1pP4Ih3lxjbW8Qkh7yG22lQhGt1W*/Capture.PNG?width=750\" width=\"635\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/n8UsK9SRM-XGpwQolEcf6SjX7yk2b8SHNLDTfOI94g13OVQSrtTkIRL6AjlV2e2FeMf1pP4Ih3lxjbW8Qkh7yG22lQhGt1W*/Capture.PNG)\n\nI've been checking some of the previous discussion regarding the Psych Chart crashing and it seems i have a different issue.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1540643", "name": "psych_crash.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1540644", "name": "RhinoCrashDump.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Pin", "created_at": "June 1, 2016 at 9:54pm", "created_by": "Pin", "topic": "Psychrometric Chart Crashing", "id": "topic_1540645"}
