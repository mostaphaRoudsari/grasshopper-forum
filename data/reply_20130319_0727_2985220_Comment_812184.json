{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for your quick reply. That sounds great!\n\nI checked your preview video of Honeybee and it looks equally amazing to your Ladybug work so far.\n\nEven the different sub components you have like the floor sub-division per ftf and use, are extremely useful to simplify custom made larger algorithms. You really stretch GH to a new level of usability for real life projects. Your work will be very soon widely used worldwide, replacing relevant software suites.\n\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\n\ndoompop\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "March 19, 2013 at 07:27AM", "created_by": "doompop", "parent_id": "topic_811691", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_812184"}
