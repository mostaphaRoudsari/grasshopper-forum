{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\n\n\nYes, it is possible in HB[+]. We take the three channel (RGB) irradiance results and convert it into illuminance ([example](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee/blob/master/scripts/TwoPhaseIllum.py#L80-L86)) as per the [Photopic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopic_vision). So, if we were to not combine the results, we'll end up with RGB values.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned before, CIE skies and Perez skies are geared towards brightness and not spectral calculations. So, such a simulation is unlikely to be physically relevant. A case in point is during twilight, when daylight has a warmer hue. The spectral nature of this sun and sky is not captured in daylighting simulations.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 3, 2017 at 11:34am", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1744825", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1744961"}
