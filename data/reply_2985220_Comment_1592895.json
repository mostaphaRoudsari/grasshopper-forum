{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\n\n\nI understand perfectly now. \u00a0You are using the adaptive component correctly but, in your CBE example, you are taking the outdoor temperature AT THAT HOUR. \u00a0The outdoor temperature at a single hour is not what determines occupant comfort according to the adaptive model but rather the PREVAILING outdoor temperature. \u00a0The prevailing outdoor temperature represents the average temperature for that time of year and is either a monthly average temperature (according to ASHRAE) or a running mean outdoor temperature (according to the ISO). \u00a0I realize that it might not have been perfectly clear that the adaptive chart component is actually calculating this prevailing outdoor temperature for you from the outdoor dry bulb so I added it as in output on the adaptive chart component here:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/S5D7YsYlDekdOTpYpt01ak*ASOemTNvTZ7y8e1*RhIy0fYlQTgWU4AVc7mkcdM5jCuRudR9Gs61YXDLZOK78oiKynBqygpmp/PrevailingTemp.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/S5D7YsYlDekdOTpYpt01ak*ASOemTNvTZ7y8e1*RhIy0fYlQTgWU4AVc7mkcdM5jCuRudR9Gs61YXDLZOK78oiKynBqygpmp/PrevailingTemp.JPG)\n\n... and in the attached file.\n\n\n\nHere you can see that, even though the outdoor temperature for your specific hour is at 27.8C, the running mean temperature for that time of year is much lower around 16.7 and it is this lower temperature that drives the comfort model.\n\n\n\nLet me know if that's clear.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1592896", "name": "Adaptive_Comfort_Chart_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 3, 2016 at 2:20pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1593157", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1592895"}
