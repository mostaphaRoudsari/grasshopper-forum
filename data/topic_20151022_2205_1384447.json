{"body": "\nHello all, we ran into what is probably not a big problem, but can't find our way around it:\n\nIn running an OpenStudio simulation, We can't reassign constructions using the \u00a0\"_Set EP Zone Construction\" (setEPZoneConstr) component. No matter which construction we assign to roof and wall surfaces in HBZones, the OS generator component assigns the same generic constructions.\n\nSo far we have tried different wall and roof types. We have no issues assigning different glazing types with other components. Also, the construction definitions carry through when running the Energy Plus generating component, and those models come out differently (as intended).\n\nIs this an issue in how the OSMs get generated? Are HBZones that are generated using different components (perhaps assembled from HBsurfs) treated differently?\n\nAttached is the little experiment script we threw together to test out the issue.\n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1384446", "name": "test_why_same_constructions.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Nick Novelli", "created_at": "October 22, 2015 at 10:05PM", "created_by": "NickNovelli", "topic": "unable to re-assign constructions?", "id": "topic_1384447"}
