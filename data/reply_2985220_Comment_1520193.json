{"body": "\nHi Cheney,\n\nYes. It's possible to do it with Honeybee but there are technical issues with using Daysim for calculating ASE. Read Sarith comments [here](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/ase-calculation?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1400180&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987).\n\nI can put an example together. You can use dynamic blind workflow and check the results for each hour but let me not do it until we have a Radiance-based workflow. Anytime that I have shared example files with caveats, even though I always clearly explained the limitations, I saw them being used by users without considering the limitations. Not everyone is knowledgeable as you.\n\nLet us share the workflow with you once we have the Radiance based method ready :). Fortunately you have some alternative workflows for now to get it done.\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 1, 2016 at 3:00pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1520321", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1520193"}
