{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nThanks for the quick response. There's another wrinkle in this problem. I started creating my script for a MOO algorithm, and I tested this on this new script that utilized the previous script. This time I found:\n\n1. 8 CPUs takes a few seconds longer than 4 CPUs.\n\n2. The first analysis took about 1 minute or so, whereas the 2nd and 3rd attempt took little more than 2 minutes.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI don't understand why, but I thought I would update you. When I was first learning Ladybug/Honeybee, I repeated analyses without much discrepancy in duration. So I'm not sure what is different about my first script.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf you could still look at my original script to see if you can reproduce the results, I would appreciate it. Additionally, if you notice that the script is inefficient, I'd appreciate input. Thanks.\n\nGeof\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Geof Wright", "created_at": "January 9, 2016 at 11:52pm", "created_by": "GeofWright", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435519", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435408"}
