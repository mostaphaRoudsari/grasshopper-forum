{"body": "\nTesting using the example files from the workshop last week to rule out definition error.\n\nInstalled Dragonfly, MatLab compiler 9.0, and UWG per instructions. When I try to run the UWG component, I get this for a few seconds:\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Cmm3f1Muc2aNgXt4r7wpPUelCf1JLjDeYCuowX6BWjmkFeRxaauUuaC3RQR5XqYpc326QOQrPA5sTyJpEiD99Ba31INMAbLb/Error.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Cmm3f1Muc2aNgXt4r7wpPUelCf1JLjDeYCuowX6BWjmkFeRxaauUuaC3RQR5XqYpc326QOQrPA5sTyJpEiD99Ba31INMAbLb/Error.JPG)\n\nAnd then the simulation stops without running through anything additional in the command prompt than what is above. The EPW file is generated but it is 0kb and empty. I imagine something in my set up is not correct but I haven't the slightest idea what it can be.
