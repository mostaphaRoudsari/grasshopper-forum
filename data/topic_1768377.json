{"body": "\nHello Everybody,\n\nfirst of all i wanted to say thank you for this astonisching tool, it is extremley inspiring.\n\nI recently started a project in which i want to run an energy+ simulation of an office building with an atrium for natural ventilation. But i didn\u00b4t find a way to create a HBZone or a kind of ventilation which would work for an atrium.\n\nIs there a way to do so? Is it possible with Butterfly? And if yes, how could i merge the results from Butterfly and Honeybee to get information in how much heating, cooling, electric energy etc. this would result?\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nDominik\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dominik Simon", "created_at": "June 13, 2017 at 10:22am", "created_by": "DominikSimon", "topic": "Atrium in Energy+ Simulation_decompose HBZones crashes", "id": "topic_1768377"}
