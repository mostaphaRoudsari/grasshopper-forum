{"body": "\nHey everyone!\n\n\n\nI was wondering if it is possible to have two temperature setpoint depending on the outside temperature. I couldn't solve it since I cant pass the HBzones output through calculation components.\n\n\n\nHere in the Netherlands there is a requirement for fresh schools, wherby the outside temperature decides the indoor temperature set points.\n\nSo if outdoor temp. is below 10 than the indoor temp. is between 20 - 24 degrees\n\nand if outdoor temp is above 10 than the indoor temp. should be between 23 - 26.\n\n\n\nAttached is a really simplified picture for what i mean.\u00a0\n\nHopefully someone can help and tell me if this is possible.\n\n\n\ngr.
