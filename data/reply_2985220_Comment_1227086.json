{"body": "\nHey Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for the advice. Can't believe I wasn't accounting for the shades in the adaptive comfort matrices. I guess I thought since they were plugged in the EnergyPlus it was ok. I'm going to redo the simulations now then.\n\n\n\nI do have another question though. How do you think I can manage to put shading devices in glazing with curved geomtry? Would it be possible to use a component and somehow create a single, linear geomtry infront of the window to put the shading devices? If not, do you have any advice on the transmissivity values I can use for those 2 windows in order to 'simulate' their existence?\n\n\n\nThanks alot for the advice!\n\n\n\nHave a nice day.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 18, 2015 at 9:44pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1227081", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1227086"}
