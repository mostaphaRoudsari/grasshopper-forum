{"body": "\nChris,\n\nThanks very much for your response. \u00a0\n\nI'm still confounded here - no separate GH canvas is open, and all the HB components are ver 0.0.61. \u00a0I did grab the latest HB_HB (Feb 27) from github to see if that would solve, but same result. \u00a0Clearly though this is something with my configuration since you were able to get the thmx output. \u00a0I suppose I could wipe &amp; reinstall LB/HB as next step, although I did try this once already a couple rounds of troubleshooting ago.\n\n\n\nBelow screenshot in case it's any help:\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/9e-LbPNbsUv7DPkFUDUIQyXKtDcbCwwP0lZHiMd8dXrO0-ybXUpsSXMEEv4StfSJt3eTOft3l--nUOMqlhQ*4KpgdEsohqgO/Screen.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/9e-LbPNbsUv7DPkFUDUIQyXKtDcbCwwP0lZHiMd8dXrO0-ybXUpsSXMEEv4StfSJt3eTOft3l--nUOMqlhQ*4KpgdEsohqgO/Screen.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Joe Simms", "created_at": "March 13, 2017 at 08:50PM", "created_by": "JoeSimma", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1711366", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1711469"}
