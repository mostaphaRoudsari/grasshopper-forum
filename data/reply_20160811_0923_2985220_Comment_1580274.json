{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nmy main wish is being able to specify the outside reveal, which is not an input in the eplus object itself. In other applications though, like OpenStudio, you can specify the outside reveal which then offsets the actual window geometry from the outside wall by that distance. That way you won't have to create shading surfaces...\n\nFor the visualization in Honeybee the ExtrudeWindows component could then also get these values from the windows and show the reveal (like in the screenshot from my model, where I first moved the windows manually and the set the distance in the ExtrudeWindows component for correct visualisation).\n\nI've attached an idf file where I've put the main information in the FrameAndDivider object, for the other fields you could provide some default values.\n\nThe FrameAndDivider component could then be connected to the glazing related HB-components as an optional input, just like a EPConstruction or RADMaterial.\n\nHope this makes sense...\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1580275", "name": "FrameAndDivider.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1580276", "name": "screenshot.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1580277", "name": "eplusReveal.png"}], "created_by_name": "Albert Pressler", "created_at": "August 11, 2016 at 09:23AM", "created_by": "AlbertPressler", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1580007", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1580274"}
