{"body": "\nChelle,\n\nIt wasn't easy ... but neither too difficult.\n\nFirst, i didn't used your last file. Instead the ones from yesterday. I didn't pay attention that your model is in millimeters, so i translated to meters. For energy simulations the model MUST be in meters since E+ works only in these units.\n\nAfter this opening, please open the attached. I took the liberty to define the zones differently from you (see white group). Much more compact. I've found a lot of issues with many of your individual surfaces so i redefined from new the whole zones. Some of the windows where indeed a bit rotated from orthogonal and a bit shifted from the home surface. But they were just a few. it was easy to fix. Also your tolerance was to low (0.00001, or so). Sometimes too low is not good.\n\nDidn't internalized the geometry yet, so you can see what i linked from the Rhino model.\n\n\n\nHope this helps and good luck.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1489802", "name": "GreatNorthRdEnergyModel_AY.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1489803", "name": "GNRHoneybeezones_AY_meterss.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 22, 2016 at 03:33AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489884", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489801"}
