{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n<br/>When does the .bat file created by the honeybee component get executed? When I try to run the HDR to GIF component directly from grasshopper it never works, but if I run the .bat file manually from my computer, it works just fine -it creates the .gif file and I can preview it through embryo by copying the file path directly.\n\n<br/>The same exact thing is true about the component that creates the .irr file. if I double click the .bat file it works, otherwise, honeybee never creates the .irr file.\n\n\n\nGH file attached.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1433477", "name": "steve.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Helena Zambrano", "created_at": "January 7, 2016 at 3:29pm", "created_by": "HelenaZambrano", "topic": "HDR to GIF component", "id": "topic_1433478"}
