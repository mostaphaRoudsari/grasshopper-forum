{"body": "\nChris, all:\n\n\n\nI'm struggling to get a finished Therm analysis of a custom detail, having had success with the example files.\n\nThe problem is that when I wire all my ThermPolygons to the WriteTherm component, it reports the following error:\n\n\"Failed to call _polygons and boundaries_ from the HB Hive. Make sure that connected geometry to _polygons is from the 'Create Therm Polygons' component and that geometry to boundaries_ is from the 'Create Therm Boundaries' component.\"\n\nIt seems to be only certain ThermPolygon components that trigger this (the 4 situated last - and currently unwired - in the attached .gh file)\n\nFurther, some of the geometry tends to lose it's reference (and report Null) when I close and reopen the .gh file.\n\nI checked that the Rhino surfaces are all contiguous and form a single polysurface, with normals all in the same direction.\n\nI am a Rhino novice, so hoping that i am missing something easy and obvious here.\n\n\n\nI'm running the 02/05/17 version of the Honeybee components.\n\n\n\nThanks to anyone in advance for any help,\n\nJoe\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1694022", "name": "Curtain Wall Test.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1694023", "name": "Curtain Wall Test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Joe Simms", "created_at": "February 17, 2017 at 9:57pm", "created_by": "JoeSimma", "topic": "Therm: Help with \"Failed to call _polygons and boundaries_ from the HB Hive\"?", "id": "topic_1694024"}
