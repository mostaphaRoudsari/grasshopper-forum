{"body": "\nThank you mostapha for the reply.\u00a0I totally overlooked the testvec output and it makes things much easier and light on the feet.\n\n\n\nThe only thing I like about using mesh vertices is that the points line up almost perfectly with the panelization grid I used with paneling tools component. I am using the karamba mesh brep to and the grid patterns from these tools on the surfaces are in sync, and the points are more of a rectangular grid.\n\n\n\nI did try to rebuild the geometry as meshes separately and join mesh before feeding it to ladybug in order to avoid triangles. but for some reason the component gave no output. It said solution exception: 'int' object has no attribute 'get bounding box'\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/17StHKe5zK4Hf9kPJ96ECiLwdP6YvKuQrRpkMJfFP7jAjzV8tn0lgI2VjCUCqFZtIfLdZMRKrxFSkaAvktEVraxAjbQuNbaC/Screenshot2014112020.09.16.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/17StHKe5zK4Hf9kPJ96ECiLwdP6YvKuQrRpkMJfFP7jAjzV8tn0lgI2VjCUCqFZtIfLdZMRKrxFSkaAvktEVraxAjbQuNbaC/Screenshot2014112020.09.16.png)\n\nKaramba mesh brep gave a clean mesh so I ended up using it for the analysis.\u00a0I think you are right about it the mesh vertices approach being more complicated and it is really slow. I guess the ideal solution would be that I rebuild the vertical faces of breps as rectangular meshes (the vertical faces) and join that mesh with floor slab meshes that has some triangles. and if radiation analysis likes the mesh, then everything will be fine.\n\n\n\nThe download link for the rhino file is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/js1snb9f4ymbyzz/ttt_export.3dm?dl=0): about 10mb.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1176474", "name": "ttt.exportgh.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1176475", "name": "CZ04RV2.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "November 27, 2014 at 4:44am", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1176420", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1176473"}
