{"body": "\nHi Francesco, Mohammad and Abraham, Thank you for the nice comments.\n\n\n\n- The installer takes care of copying both the libraries and the userobjects.\n\n- Honeybee[+] has dependencies on Ladybug[+]. That's why there is also a folder for ladybug.\n\n- Both the legacy version and the new release works with latest release of the radiance. As a matter of fact any release after version 5.0.a.11 is good.\u00a0[We found a bug](https://unmethours.com/question/17201/rcontrib-misses-one-of-the-modifiers-if-number-of-modifiers-between-240-420/?comment=17658#post-id-17658) in radiance during the development which is fixed in 5.0.a.11 release.\n\n\n\nPS: I updated the installation files to include the sample files. You can also find them [here](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-grasshopper/tree/master/plugin/grasshopper/sampleFiles).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 23, 2017 at 09:58AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1805715", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1802552"}
