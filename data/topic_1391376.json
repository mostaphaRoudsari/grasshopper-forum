{"body": "\nHey guys,\n\n\n\nFor another simulation tool(Delphin) I'm using, i'm in need of the short-wave and long-wave radiation on a surface.\n\nI thought that LB/HB could calculate it for me. I have done an annual radiation simulation on the surface. Does anyone know how to separate my output into long-wave and short-wave?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Kongsgaard", "created_at": "November 2, 2015 at 1:45pm", "created_by": "ChristianKongsgaard", "topic": "Long and short wave radiation", "id": "topic_1391376"}
