{"body": "\nJustin and Abraham,\n\n\n\nSorry for not looking deeper into this before. \u00a0I didn't realize how much the new capabilities that I had added to the zone shades component had damaged the shade benefit workflow. \u00a0The big reason why the component was running endlessly was that when you add zoneData2_ and zoneData3_ inputs to the component, they were not being set to Tree access automatically (each item of the tree was being evaluated and this was causing the component to run 8760x4 times). \u00a0The assigning of tree access now happens automatically. \u00a0The attached file should work well without complications.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5E78cygXwe2R1QniBTgBckm8DE7VllE3tasJaeVpm9x-9ZtAJLz9cJ6LUiyaZ1QyIeCqgD9DaDC7Z9F9JjtmNhJ5detDF1A8/WorkingShadeBenefit.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5E78cygXwe2R1QniBTgBckm8DE7VllE3tasJaeVpm9x-9ZtAJLz9cJ6LUiyaZ1QyIeCqgD9DaDC7Z9F9JjtmNhJ5detDF1A8/WorkingShadeBenefit.JPG)\n\nAlso, I updated the Hydra example file:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Energy_Shade_Benefit&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions and thank you for bringing this to my attention.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1505978", "name": "Energy_Shade_Benefit.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 11, 2016 at 10:55am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1503053", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1505977"}
