{"body": "Albert,\n\nAlso 2 other suggestions that have made my HBZone geometry creation life easier:\n1) Use a relatively coarse Rhino tolerance of 0.01 meters when starting to trace the plans. This lessens my chances of making really small surfaces in the intersect masses component. This said, if you have zone geometries that you know are clean, DO NOT change the tolerance of the model. It just opens up Pandora's box\n2) Make sure that you have object snaps on when you trace the plans such that you can snap to the lines that you have already drawn.\n\nHope this helps,\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 10, 2016 at 07:28AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579408", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579819"}
