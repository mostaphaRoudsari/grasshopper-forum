{"body": "\nMauricio,\n\nI had already checked that post out. There is indeed great information there, but my concern was getting more info on the specific values that were suggested in Honeybee. I agree that infiltration is a tricky subject, but when there is no measured data available these notions of approximate rates are great to have.\n\n\n\nChris,\n\nExcellent. This is exactly what I was looking for. I would love to see a greater sample, classified by climate zone, but I guess that is too much to ask. If you or somebody else knows where to find something that gets closer to it, it would be great.\n\n\n\nThank you to both of you!\n\nJorge\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jorge Conejo", "created_at": "October 07, 2016 at 11:19PM", "created_by": "JorgeConejo", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1613679", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1613915"}
