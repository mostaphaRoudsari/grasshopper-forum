{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI am following the example file and the Mostapha tutorial for Daylight factor calculation with Honeybee. I can't input the Location and I understand the explaination of Mostapha for this aspect, but I am doing my thesis and I am comparing this result with DIALUX result, to validate the process. In DIALUX I have to set (for Cloudy Sky) time (month hour and day) and location.\n\n\n\nWhich is the difference between this two methods? Why Honeybee doesn't have this possibility? Which input I have to use to compare it with dialux results?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance to everyone who can help me to understand better\n\nDavid\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Maimone", "created_at": "February 1, 2016 at 5:13am", "created_by": "DavidMaimone", "topic": "DayLight Factor Difference between HONEYBEE and other daylight analysis programs", "id": "topic_1451916"}
