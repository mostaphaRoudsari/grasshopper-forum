{"body": "\nHi everyone,\u00a0\n\nI'm also contributing a Solar Fan and Envelope component to Ladybug. Mine is done in a slightly different way from the components presented here. The Fan component is also done differently from the one in DIVA4Grasshopper - mine should produce a more precise boundary that includes all the sun positions for a given user-defined time-period. The trade-off is that it's a little slower especially for concave shapes. Apologies for the confusing icons, they are just placeholders for now :)\n\nAttached is an example gh file - please test it out.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1002980", "name": "solarFan_solarEnvelope_2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "February 4, 2014 at 5:00pm", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "parent_id": "topic_969681", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1002978"}
