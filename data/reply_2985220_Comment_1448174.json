{"body": "\nHello Rasel,\n\n\n\nActually the only difference from your picture and the other one is a preview on the component that includes all the house. The selector or brep component in both pictures has selected one room, the difference is just that all the house (from the component exactly before your selector) is still displayed.\n\n\n\nRight click the masses to zones component and press \"preview off\" (the little grey head icon).\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 8:03am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1447163", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448174"}
