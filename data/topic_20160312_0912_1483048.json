{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\n\n\nI've been trying to get this energy model up and running and after recreating my zones a few times to make them energy plus friendly, I got this error,\n\n\n\n'hb_EPZoneSurface' object has no attribute 'punchedGeometry'.\n\n\n\nI did a little searching on the discussion board and found this link,\n\n\n\n[RunEnergySimulation error](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/runenergysimulation-error-hb-epzonesurface-object-has-no)\n\n\n\nAs of right now, it seems to have gone unsolved, so I was wondering if there was anything I could do to circumvent this error so my energy calc will go through. In the link Mostapha said it usually only happens with double curvature surfaces, but I don't think I have any curved surfaces in my file, so I'm at a lose.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1483047", "name": "HUB Project.gh"}], "created_by_name": "John Keyes", "created_at": "March 12, 2016 at 09:12AM", "created_by": "JohnKeyes", "topic": "'hb_EPZoneSurface' object has no attribute 'punchedGeometry' error", "id": "topic_1483048"}
