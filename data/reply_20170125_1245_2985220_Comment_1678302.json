{"body": "\nHi Giulio,\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for the quick response!\n\n\n\nI was not able to uninstall IronPython as it came in the package when I installed Rhino 5. I tried deleting the files and deactivating it from the Rhino properties, but when I do this and try to open a python editor, it crashes Rhino and Grasshopper.\n\n\n\nIs there a version of IronPython that works in harmony with ghPython?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\nMosh\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mosh Porter", "created_at": "January 25, 2017 at 12:45PM", "created_by": "MoshPorter", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678062", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678302"}
