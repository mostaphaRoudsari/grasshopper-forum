{"body": "\nHi Marco,\n\nUnfortunately, EnergyPlus does not really have a good way to model a custom shade as you have in a manner that includes the surface temperature of the shading device. \u00a0It can model blinds, drapes, and screens very well (I imagine that you might approximate your geometry as a screen if we had good algorithms to analyze how and when the sun passes through it).\n\nFor now, my advice would just be to go back to the original plan to use the \"EP Context Surface\" component, knowing that the surface temperature of the material is estimated to be that of the outdoor air and that this can be a source of error if your shading material is very thin. \u00a0Also, make sure that you use a \"Honeybee_ShadowPar\" and \"Honeybee_Energy Simulation Par\" component for and connect them to the \"EnergySimPar\" input of the \"Run Energy Simulation Component.\" \u00a0Boost up the \"maximumFigure\" input of the \"SahdowPar\" component to be sure that EnergyPlus accurately calculates the sun that gets through your shading device.\n\nAlso, for the record, the HBObjects that you plug into the \"Window Shade Generator\" component are HBSrfs that have windows assigned to them. Not shading geometry.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 22, 2015 at 06:09PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1208994", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209552"}
