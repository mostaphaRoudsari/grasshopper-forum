{"body": "Hey devang, thanks as always. But the convex geometry that the error message is talking about is the context geometry. I have tried disconnecting it and running the simulation again, solving the convex geometry error. But there was no change in the read EP result and Color Zones component output.\nI will add that the error is shown in both, the EP and OSM components yet only the EP component gives a desirable output.\n\nAs for the crash, my bet is on the number of floors (5) which are defined at the very beginning (my PC can barely handle them despite the high config.).", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "nishant pandav", "created_at": "February 07, 2017 at 10:32AM", "created_by": "nishantpandav", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1686664", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1686897"}
