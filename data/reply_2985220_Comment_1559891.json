{"body": "\nDjordje,\n\n\n\nI got it to run. \u00a0Steps 3 and 4 were so similar that I missed one of them. \u00a0If we can't find another way because of admin privileges, I think most users will still tolerate a short manual install of downloading and unzipping.\n\n\n\nHowever, why is it that the user needs to take all of the content out of the bin and CSharp folders and dump them in the main folder? \u00a0If the user has installed the tool by downloading, unblocking, and unzipping the tool, can't we just be sure that the required files are in the bin and CSharp folders as opposed to the main folder? \u00a0So we search for them there as opposed to the main folder?\n\n\n\nIf we could get rid of steps 3 and 4, I think that it would go a long way to lowering the barrier to using the tool and would prevent dumb posts like the one that I have done here.\u00a0\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 4, 2016 at 11:25am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559779", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559891"}
