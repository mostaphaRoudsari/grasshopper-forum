{"body": "\nHi Kit,\n\n\n\nThis is a very good question. I realized that there is an E+ input that allows you to make the exact control strategy that you have specified here, which I forgot to expose on the EPAirflow component. \u00a0If you need the result right now, you can get it by editing this input in the IDF file that Honeybee writes:\n\n\n\n[http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-5/input-output-reference/gr...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-5/input-output-reference/group-airflow.html#field-delta-temperature)\n\n... And then use the rerunIDF component to run the simulation with your new IDF.\n\n\n\nI'll try to expose this DeltaTemperature input shortly and post back here once it's added to the github.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 7, 2017 at 7:24am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726516", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1729100"}
