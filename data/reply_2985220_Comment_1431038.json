{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\n\n\nI still haven't tried as I got stuck in some other projects but is first on my list for the upcoming week. I am not sure though what to do with new materials .idf's that I have generated. Only thing that I have tried is to copy the generated Text file inputs (from the idf Text editor) into GH like Chris is doing in this [example](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Green_Roof_In_Energy_Model)\u00a0but still need to test if it works properly.\u00a0As for the nonBSDF material I would try to create a common directory and save the properties in a .csv and read them in GH from there to assign them \"automatically\" to new constructions? Still though a workaround and probably not less of a work than inputting values manually.\u00a0\n\nAny better ideas?\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "January 5, 2016 at 5:57am", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1430661", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1431038"}
