{"body": "\nHey guys,\n\n\n\nI am trying to run energy simulation for a whole building in energyplus and I am encountering sever errors when I run the simulation. The error I am getting is this:\n\n\n\n9. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> \u00a0\u00a0 ** Severe\u00a0 ** FenestrationSurface:Detailed=\"ZONE_4_SRF_3_GLZ_0\", invalid blank Outside Boundary Condition Object\n\n\n\nAnd there are tons of these errors for each zone.\n\n\n\nI have attached grasshopper file. I tried to set every thing right. I do not know what might be the problem and how can I fix it.\u00a0Could anybody tell me if I set my model right or wrong?\n\n\n\nI would appreciate your help and response.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1734607", "name": "energy simulation og whole building.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mitra Sajjadi", "created_at": "April 17, 2017 at 08:17PM", "created_by": "MitraSajjadi", "topic": "Problem with Boundry Conditions in EnrgyPlus simulation", "id": "topic_1734608"}
