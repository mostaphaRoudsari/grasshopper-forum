{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI'm working with HB. After the simulation with **000_gettingStarted_with_honeybee** I've checked the **.bat** file to see what I did with Radiance. Here I've found something that for me (a newbie of this world) appear strange, that is the **rpict** command run two times with the same parameters to obtain the same output (**.unf)**.**\u00a0**\n\nI can't understand the usefulness of this step. Why HB works in this manner? \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nGiuseppe.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "May 31, 2014 at 11:38am", "created_by": "GiuseppeDM", "topic": "The LBHB \"backstage\"", "id": "topic_1081201"}
