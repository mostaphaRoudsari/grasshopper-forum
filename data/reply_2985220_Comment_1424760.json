{"body": "\nHi Dmitry,\n\nSorry to hear that. The last solution that I can think of is to check if gendaymtx is blocked. You can right click on the file and check properties to see if it is blocked.\n\nAlso if you check inside c:\\ladybug\\odessa_ukr there should be a .bat file which you can open as a text file and add a **Pause\u00a0**at the end of it as a new line. Save the file and re-run it. We should be able to see the error there.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 21, 2015 at 5:29pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1420719", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1424760"}
