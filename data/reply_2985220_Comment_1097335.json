{"body": "\nHi Andrea,\n\nSomething happened to my reply so I'm trying again.\n\nNot sure what do you mean by \"The results (daylight factor) that I obtained with Honeybee are different from the radiance results. Is this possible?\" Honeybee uses RADIANCE for simulating DF. It doesn't have an engine.\n\nAre you using same parameters in both cases? As you are using a trans material make sure that you set parameters for specular reflection right and also set the -ab to an acceptable number for the case with shading.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 3, 2014 at 6:22pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1096987", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1097335"}
