I can't seem to figure out how to show the different colors of the mesh in the rendering. Any help would be much appreciated.\n\n\n\nUpdate: The analysis mesh doesn't render at all. I tried rendering using Maxwell and Rhino's render\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "November 27, 2016 at 07:11PM", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "topic": "How do I render a baked analysis mesh?", "id": "topic_1646996"}
