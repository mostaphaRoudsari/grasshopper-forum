{"body": "\nDear Mostapha,\n\nI am really sorry bout \"Inquiry\", and thank you for the link..\n\n\n\nActually, I read the warning message, it needs an (Input parameter_illuminanceValue) failed to collect data. However, in your tutorial you used (genSkyIlluminanceLevel) with out an input data!\n\nAlso, I know that (_) before the parameter means; data should be connected. That is why I am little confused.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ahmad Eltaweel", "created_at": "March 09, 2016 at 07:26AM", "created_by": "AhmadEltaweel", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1480315", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1480204"}
