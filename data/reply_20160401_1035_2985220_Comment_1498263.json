{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnswering your question of why is it needed that the context has to be required to run the simulation, perhaps its just in the particular case for making multi-objective optimization for shading devices in software outside from GH environment.\n\nIn the workflow I am trying to propose I need to collect the data from the result of the radiation in the system as a whole (window + shading devices) my point of departure for example is when the shading devices are geometrically at their minimum size, rotation, etc.\n\nTherefore from that minimum I can begin my optimization towards the maximum radiation on the window over any period of time.\n\nSo since the context is optional, when I run the optimization software linked to GH, the necessary inputs are in the RunEnergySimulation to run (with or without the shading devices), the optimization loop never gets completed since it will run all the time.\u00a0\n\nIn the end I want to aim for a workflow that delivers the user an informed design decision where he can be able to be informed of the contribution of every design parameter on to a certain design.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDoes this make my question less confusing?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Luis E.
