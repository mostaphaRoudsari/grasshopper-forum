{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThanks for checking the file for me. I don't know if you remember, but you helped me setting up the Ray_trace component in this file few weeks ago, hence the file name ends with AY:)\n\nThis file is going to drive me nuts, I updated the components using the HB_update component, this didn't fix the problem, then I tried downloading the components from Github and dragged them to Grasshopper, this didn't work either. any suggestions? what method did you use to update the components?
