{"body": "\nHi Mostapha!\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for the reply and the links!\u00a0\n\nI am trying to do this now, but I run into some problems:\n\n\n\n1. If I use the Daysim component where should I generate the sky from? Since there is no sky my analysis doesn't run. Earlier,\u00a0I have tried the hourly solar analysis using the Grid-based, where I can generate a sky, but then I have to run 8760 simulations, which takes quite a long time.\u00a0\n\n2. If I want to examine 1 surface (PV panel) and I want to have surroundings, which are not taken into the analysis, but still generate shading and reflections, there is no input to the analysis component?\n\n\n\nMihail\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1262088", "name": "solar analysis.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Mihail Todorov", "created_at": "April 13, 2015 at 1:10pm", "created_by": "MihailTodorov", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1261126", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262086"}
