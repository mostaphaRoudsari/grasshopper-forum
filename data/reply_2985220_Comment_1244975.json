{"body": "\nHi Alejandro and Djordje,\n\nBack to Butterfly I just can hope that they move faster but I can't promise! Maybe we should start developing a new Butterfly from scratch? Should take less time!\n\nI have a [pretty hackey] script that I developed when I was at school to connect Rhino to Ansys Fluent. It was working at the time and we automated an optimization study with that script but I have no idea if it will be still working. I already shared it with couple of people and don't mind to share it with you if you have access to Fluent. I can't find the file right now but I should be able to find it if needed.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 18, 2015 at 10:45am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1244257", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1244975"}
