{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nFirst of all, thanks for the great work on HB! It is proving very fun and useful.\n\n\n\nI am trying to do some optimization study on the cooling and heating load of a generic building by using Honeybee and Galapagos. There are two identical floors with 6 zones at the bottom floor and top floor separated by an adiabatic component in the middle. I have sliders affecting the thermal properties of the envelope, the WWR, and the shading depths.\n\n\n\nI left my Galapagos running overnight and it ran out of RAM (have a 16GB RAM on Comp, Rhino was maxing out at 14.x GB).\n\n\n\nAt first I thought it was Galapagos causing this problem, but then I tried to manually adjust the sliders myself and found that each adjustment of slider would increase RAM, and very rarely it may decrease RAM. This was with the EPlus simulation component turned off, so I was basically just changing the parameters.\n\n\n\nWith about 17 changes in parameter sliders I was able to increase my RAM usage from 1.3GB to 4.6GB. This was with all previews off.\n\n\n\nI tried the following:\n\nUndoClear in Rhino - No effect\n\nSolution -&gt; Clear + Recompute - Adds to RAM usage\n\n\n\nIs this something to do with Rhino? GH? HB? It seems that it is continuously remembering all previous states? Or would it have something to do with how I built the flow of GH (I'm quite new to it, so maybe it is something I am doing).\n\n\n\nGreatly appreciate any help, would really want to be able to do some nice optimization runs.
