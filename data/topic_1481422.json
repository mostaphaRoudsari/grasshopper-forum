{"body": "\nDear All,\n\nI'm doing my master study of how to determine the optimum window opening ratio (office space) using typical materials (glass and wall properties) for a single climatic location. the study will include how a proper window opening size can provide a good daylight and minimizing the usage of artificial lighting during most of the day times, in the same time i believe it can minimize the HVAC energy required to cool down overheated spaces that are a result of using excessive window openings.\n\n\n\nFor now i'm using LB+HB to study this model and i would love to get some feedback from expertise who went through similar process and advise with useful tips that can help me on this topic.\n\n\n\nAppreciate your help.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ataur Rahman", "created_at": "March 10, 2016 at 8:46am", "created_by": "AtaurRahman", "topic": "Daylighting and Energy Modeling", "id": "topic_1481422"}
