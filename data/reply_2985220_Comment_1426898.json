{"body": "\nThanks again Chris and Mostapha\u00a0.. I did look at data obtained through \"Read All the Hourly Results from Annual Daylight Study\". It gives\u00a0 global illuminance and not diffuse illuminance (sky illuminance) when finding external illuminance under unobstructed sky\u00a0 .... what I'm looking for is a way to find the diffuse horizontal illuminance (sky illuminance) under un obstructed sky\n\nThanks\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Khalid Al", "created_at": "December 27, 2015 at 5:20am", "created_by": "KhalidAl", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1425429", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1426898"}
