{"body": "\nThank You Mostapha.\n\nI downloaded the last file you posted in the discussion (Testfile). It works perfectly.\n\nHowever if I make exactly what is in that file, but with my updated components (the latest version, updated yesterday) it gives me the same error as the beginning.\n\nThen if i open the Testfile and i try to use some other component, i get an error message because, it says, i am using a different version of LB.\n\nI am confused.\n\nI attach here the Testfile, without error, but with old components, and my file (Radiation analysis), with updated components but still with the error.\n\nPlease, could you tell me what can I do to have a good result for the diffuse radiation using my updated components?\n\nThank you.\n\nRegards.\n\nMarcello.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1612921", "name": "2015.01.25testfiles_updated_.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1612922", "name": "Radiation analysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Marcello_t", "created_at": "October 07, 2016 at 05:38AM", "created_by": "Marcellot", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1608151", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1612919"}
