{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks a lot for the comprehensive explanation and for sharing the resources!\n\nI agree that the current adaptive standard feels a little tight and oversimplified.\n\nAnother argument of debate would be the fact of having 12 reference values (monthly means), to determine the comfort temperature for 365 days, where daily mean temperatures could be drastically different from one day to the other. It would be interesting to see how many more drops could be squeezed from the lemon of passive conditioning if using daily means instead monthly to get the adaptive comfort ranges in the year. But I guess that\u00b4s a whole different discussion.\n\nSuerte en todo,\n\nAlejandro\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Gamas", "created_at": "June 22, 2015 at 01:10AM", "created_by": "AlejandroGamas", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1313176", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1313320"}
