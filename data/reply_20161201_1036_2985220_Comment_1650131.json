{"body": "\nMostapha,\u00a0\n\nSorry I forgot to mention this in my previous reply.\u00a0\n\nI think that in HB, Radiance materials are defined separately from E+ materials. Which could be tricky, if the user does not pay enough attention to match those. One could make a mistake by not adjusting Visible Tranmittance in E+ material to match the Radiance material.\u00a0\n\nThanks again for your help and support\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "December 01, 2016 at 10:36AM", "created_by": "LillyGD", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1649955", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1650131"}
