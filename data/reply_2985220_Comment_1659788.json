{"body": "\nThanks for the reply, I want to be in the testing team if its possible, btw I can provide logartimic expressions(.c file) as to wind profile.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAfter some comprehensive research I have seen that OpenFoam divides the pressure values to air density for the output results. However in CFD simulations we wait for relative pressure loads as its. So do you have a plan to corect these values coming from OF?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "anarchitect", "created_at": "December 19, 2016 at 2:52am", "created_by": "mimarilker", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1659659", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1659788"}
