{"body": "\nLeland,\n\nThe radiance questions are way out of my league and they are definitely for Mostapha or possibly even Greg Ward and the Radiance team. \u00a0I don't know how to make the specific sky that you are looking for.\n\nI can, however, speak to the method I put in the shade shade optimizer, which Mostapha had helped me develop. \u00a0Right now the shade benefit evaluator only works for direct radiation (I will incorporate diffuse radiation soon) and so it uses just the sun vectors. \u00a0If you boost up the sky resolution input on that component to the highest value that it can go, it will intersect every sun vector of every hour of the year with your test mesh. \u00a0This high accuracy usually isn't necessary to make most design decisions so I usually group these vectors by sky patch in order to cut down the number of intersections and the time that it takes to run the component. \u00a0Sky resolutions that are lower than 4 just divide up the Tregenza sky patches. \u00a0So 0 is the original 145 patches, 1 is 4 times 145, 2 is 16 times 145, etc. \u00a0Perhaps there is a way to use this method of sky patch division in your case too although, if you need the diffuse radiation, I'm not sure that it will be so helpful yet.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 07, 2014 at 10:37AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163758", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163776"}
