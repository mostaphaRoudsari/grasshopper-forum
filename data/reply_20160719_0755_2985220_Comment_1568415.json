{"body": "\nThank you very much for taking your time to find an alternative solution. It has been very helpful.\n\nIndeed, the calculations take a very long time when I select all of the panels. (There was a red cross popping up saying **Solution Aborted**.)\u00a0\n\nHowever, I have been playing around with the **Radiation Analysis** component, which makes calculations faster than the **PV Surface** component, allows to add shading context and has a built-in legend. It will probably be less accurate than the **PV Surface** calculations, but could you tell me how much it would deviate? Or what simple things I could add to improve the accuracy? The results are pretty satisfying, though.\u00a0\n\nI just have an issue with displaying the **Tags** of the TOF. How can I make them smaller? Because when I bake them, they have the same scale whether I zoom in or out...\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pBewlkvOZIh8m0gM5uUb-ljpVsh4aH3FlBmUNd0W0-sQc*hvP0r2WVfd2MmbWzpN5JJ9WHlI6KXXQ4wuKThRAQzV0e8A1x8m/Capture28.PNG\" width=\"673\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pBewlkvOZIh8m0gM5uUb-ljpVsh4aH3FlBmUNd0W0-sQc*hvP0r2WVfd2MmbWzpN5JJ9WHlI6KXXQ4wuKThRAQzV0e8A1x8m/Capture28.PNG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pBewlkvOZIik2NCa0y5p9v6zR-Aa-mRz8QPMeUvmeE4MnTLLSjtwMzjbLUZiTgGWcy6b2vWwmqepB1pEH1aqd9itEbBbLvr5/Capture29.PNG\" width=\"622\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pBewlkvOZIik2NCa0y5p9v6zR-Aa-mRz8QPMeUvmeE4MnTLLSjtwMzjbLUZiTgGWcy6b2vWwmqepB1pEH1aqd9itEbBbLvr5/Capture29.PNG)[<br/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pBewlkvOZIik2NCa0y5p9v6zR-Aa-mRz8QPMeUvmeE4MnTLLSjtwMzjbLUZiTgGWcy6b2vWwmqepB1pEH1aqd9itEbBbLvr5/Capture29.PNG)\n\n[\u00a0](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pBewlkvOZIh8m0gM5uUb-ljpVsh4aH3FlBmUNd0W0-sQc*hvP0r2WVfd2MmbWzpN5JJ9WHlI6KXXQ4wuKThRAQzV0e8A1x8m/Capture28.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erik Pelicaen", "created_at": "July 19, 2016 at 07:55AM", "created_by": "ErikPelicaen", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1568221", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1568415"}
