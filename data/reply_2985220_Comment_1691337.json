{"body": "\nHi Julia! :)\n\n\n\nThanks for your suggestions and taking the time on this.\n\n\n\n\n\nI see that you are using an opaque material definition with the soil layer, disregarding the grass. By specifying a simple opaque material, I think that EnergyPlus would not take into account the\n\n\n\n\n\n**long wave and short wave radiative exchange within the plant canopy**\n\n**plant canopy effects on convective heat transfer**\n\n**and evapotranspiration from the soil and plants**\n\n**(engineering reference of EnergyPlus)**\n\n\n\nwhich I guess are some of the benefits of this assembly. Since for this case we are mainly looking at the resultant radiant temperature,\n\n\n\nWouldn't this be an oversimplification of the problem?\u00a0\n\n\n\nRafael\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rafael A.", "created_at": "February 14, 2017 at 4:56am", "created_by": "RafaelA", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1691164", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1691337"}
