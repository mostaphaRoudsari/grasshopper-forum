{"body": "\nChris and\u00a0Theodoros,\n\n\n\nThank you for your ideas and extensive help.\n\nCFD is in fact an option, but I decided to use airflow network done in another program and coupling it with E+ through Honeybee, for retrieving faster solutions. I am still working on how faster this process could be compared to a CFD analysis.\n\nThe file that Chris attached is exactly what I was looking for. I didn't know there was the possibility to customize the idf file through Honeybee. In this way I can easily change the airflow rate between zones in a specific way, and for each zone differently.\n\n\n\nThank you again.\n\nAntonio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonio D'Aquilio", "created_at": "September 14, 2015 at 04:59AM", "created_by": "AntonioDAquilio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1360392", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1361149"}
