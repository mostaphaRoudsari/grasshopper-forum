{"body": "\nHI Guys,\n\n\n\nGlad that some one else is trying this.\n\n@[Arie-Willem de Jongh](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topic/listForContributor?user=11k5duqqypkod). I haven't complete this analysis as we are on working dwgs. But I do need to present the conclusions of this to our client and landscape architect. So far I only managed to illustrate the solar gain using a radiance analysis. Comparing a mat surface vs a mirror like surface and collecting the results from the grid on the target area. But this method does not illustrate the comfort of a person standing there. So I guess what Chris is proposing does work partially.\u00a0\n\n@Chris:\n\nI've downloaded your Gh file and for some reason I get a error on the output of the mannequin mesh output of the\u00a0 Solar Temp. Adjustor component. I noticed that all the inputs are empty. Please see attached image.\n\nLB : VER 0.0.60 AUG_15_2015\n\nHB : VER 0.057 AUG-19-2015\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/t3tIV4vY4JoPecoRZgTcc2gufjPe*TSPcbpkUE1nODEO2oCosnqrmKdc9lrUdUoEudYFM2tu3iIDS*2lyV6qhVOScjRVGTeP/Untitled2.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/t3tIV4vY4JoPecoRZgTcc2gufjPe*TSPcbpkUE1nODEO2oCosnqrmKdc9lrUdUoEudYFM2tu3iIDS*2lyV6qhVOScjRVGTeP/Untitled2.jpg)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "August 21, 2015 at 10:24am", "created_by": "Claudio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1346850", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1347113"}
