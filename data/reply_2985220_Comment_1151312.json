{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThank you very much for your reply - the IES to HB component is grey and seems to be working however it gives me no output. Do you know what I did wrong please?(rad and bat files attached) Also I had to double click on the bat file to get the rad one - the component did not generate the rad.\n\nMany thanks\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/q*PPwpWBvhahCiUUxKnxeUbB3CBC7-skvZewQPxQIGm4dbTAEdb*kEHacKpCZtoDc-VnKGA7WSKJVrhlUaLK8f3cYzPGxLDD/Canvasat133128.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/q*PPwpWBvhahCiUUxKnxeUbB3CBC7-skvZewQPxQIGm4dbTAEdb*kEHacKpCZtoDc-VnKGA7WSKJVrhlUaLK8f3cYzPGxLDD/Canvasat133128.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1151314", "name": "Test1_0.7_ies2rad.bat"}], "created_by_name": "Arthur Mamou-Mani", "created_at": "October 18, 2014 at 6:34am", "created_by": "arthurmamoumani", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1065346", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151312"}
