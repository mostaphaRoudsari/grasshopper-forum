{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for the response!\n\n\n\nYes that is exactly what I mean, a bunch of small, round windows on an opaque wall creating a kind of perforated screen pattern. Now I know how to input a shading component in E+ but that would mean I would have to have a really big window and shade it in a perforated screen pattern. That wouldn't work. Was just wondering if anyone had ever used a workaround to designing all the windows in such a case.\n\n\n\nAs for internal mass, I remember you told me once that interior surfaces are only thermal masses to E+ so I was wondering if an internal shading is even possible, if it is only accounted as a thermal mass.\n\n\n\nPerhaps a solution would be to split a roof like that to 2 zones.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 7:10pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519149", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519002"}
