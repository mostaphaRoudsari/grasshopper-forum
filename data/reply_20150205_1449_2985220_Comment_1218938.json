{"body": "\nI updated the JSON file from your location.\n\n\n\nI attach the sample file I am working on.\n\n\n\nCan t really nail down the exact behavior \"delay\". Maybe it s related to how GH work natively...don t know...\n\n\n\nFor example when you just reconnect HBZones output to HBZone input as seen in the attached photo I get the error you can see. If you re-run the whole GH it works.\n\n\n\nAlso the ColorSurfaces components seems to have broken in this latest update? Was working till I updated the LB, HB library and file components. I get the error:\n\n\n\n**\"1. None of the connected srfData could be matched with the surfaces in the connected HBZones.\"**\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for taking the time to look into this.\n\n\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1218939", "name": "EP_HBZones_Input_Error.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1218940", "name": "Annual_Loads_Housing_02.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "February 05, 2015 at 02:49PM", "created_by": "doompop", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1217888", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1218938"}
