{"body": "\nSverker,\n\nI am glad that you got your issue fixed. \u00a0As for your question, the \"Add To EP Construction Library\" component only copies the construction to the memory of the Grasshopper document. \u00a0As such, it is deleted when you close the file and you have to leave the \"Add To EP Construction Library\"\u00a0components in the GH file to ensure that the construction is written the next time that you open the file. \u00a0If you drag and drop an new HB_HB component onto the canvass, it overwrites the construction library in your memory so you have to make sure that any HB_HB component is in the back of the canvass (select it and hit \"Cntrl + B\" to send it to the back) and you might have to re-run the construction components to write them back to the memory.\n\nTo add constructions permanently to your library, you must add them to the\u00a0userCustomEPLibrary.idf file in the\u00a0C:\\ladybug folder (you might also have to add them to\u00a0C:\\Users\\YourUserName\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug).\n\nDaylight factor is something that Mostapha could speak more about. \u00a0Generally, I have found it to not be as useful or meaningful as Daylight Autonomy or even point-in-time Illuminance. \u00a0Just the ratio of indoor light to outdoor light doesn't tell me what it means for the visual comfort of a person.\n\nMostapha should correct me if I am wrong but I do not think that you can change the North for daylight simulations at present since Radiance does not seem to have a North input that you can change. \u00a0In the future, I think that Mostapha was planning to add a North input that would rotate all of your geometry before exporting it. \u00a0Again, I should emphasize that this last part is my inference.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 16, 2015 at 1:50pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240979", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1243628"}
