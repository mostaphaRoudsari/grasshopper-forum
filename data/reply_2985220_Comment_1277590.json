{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you! I did not notice the new release of the components. I have updated them and it works now.\n\n\n\nIn addition, considering that the function of \"daylight control\" or \"daylight threshold\" for energy simulation is not available so far ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-daylight...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-daylight-setpoint-bug)), I have to\u00a0set up the energy simulation based on an annual daylight simulation. Hereby, I have some questions as follows.\n\n\n\n-\u00a0**As for the lighting schedule (in csv format) generated from the \"annual Profiles\" in the\u00a0\"read Annual Results I\" component in daylight simulation, how can I link it (instead of the default lighting\u00a0schedule) to the\u00a0succedent energy simulation? Could you please show this in my GH files?**\n\nI could imagine how to make \"customized\" EP constructions and EP loads and link them to the simulation. But, as for EP schedules, I can not figure out how the energy simulation can receive and recognize a\u00a0\"customized\"\u00a0EP schedule (i.e. from csv files). I am asking this because the light schedule generated by daylight simulation is in csv format, and also because\u00a0the schedules provided by Honeybee are limited to some specific building type (i.e. office, retail etc.). But the schedules of some other type of buildings are not included, like\u00a0the schedules of\u00a0sports buildings.\n\n\n\n**- In the attached csv file (which is generated\u00a0<strong>from the \"annual Profiles\"**\u00a0in the\u00a0\"read Annual Results I\" component in daylight simulation), why the **electric\u00a0**lighting is still partially \"on\" even when the \"occupancy\" shows \"0 (absent)\"?</strong>\n\nFor instance, \"Row 16, 64....\" in the csv file. As I understand, the\u00a0electric\u00a0lighting is\u00a0partially/fully \"on\" only when the both of the following conditions are met, namely, there are people in the space and the illuminance level from daylight is below the threshold. Am I right?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**- Is****\u00a0the above mentioned procedure\u00a0a proper way to calculate the energy use for\u00a0electric lighting when there is a lighting\u00a0dimming system (the\u00a0<strong>electric\u00a0**lighting may be continuously adjusted in proportion to the amount of daylight available)?\u00a0</strong>\n\nApart from the above mentioned way of calculating the energy use for\u00a0electric lighting, I also made other two ways for comparison showed\u00a0in the attached image. But, the outcomes are very different. Which do you think is the most proper way to\u00a0calculate the energy use for\u00a0electric lighting when there is a lighting\u00a0dimming system?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1277592", "name": "unnamed_0_space_0_intgain.xlsx"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1277593", "name": "3 ways to calculate energy use for electric lighting.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1277594", "name": "text6.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 1:28pm", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "topic_1272120", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1277590"}
