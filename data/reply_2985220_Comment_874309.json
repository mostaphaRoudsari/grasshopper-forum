{"body": "\nHi Abraham!\n\nSorry to get back to you late. I'm moving to a new city and it has been so busy these days. Thank you for reporting the bug! I fixed it. I can't believe that I haven't seen it this long!\n\nI can't repeat what you said on my system. It just works fine here... Does it give you any warnings or so?\n\nAbsolutely! I only didn't want you to be upset as I haven't yet applied all of your comments! Can you send me your email?\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 18, 2013 at 1:57pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_869087", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_874309"}
