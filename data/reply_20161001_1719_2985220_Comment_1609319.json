{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nI am glad to hear about this new change. \u00a0I have implemented a basic version of E+ daylighting control objects on the \"Honeybee_Set Zone Thresholds\" component but this is even more basic than the 2-sensor model in that it just takes one sensor point and illuminance threshold per zone:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/VvUMGQ4qJez4p0P0wHZBQeh6V4*SgvMCXBz5ReI5PpxM5QKdTuZtwG9d*8KIXQ32PmVjdD09eHoGSTpk8DCky8sOE5Vr-*q-/NewZoneThresholds.JPG\" width=\"430\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/VvUMGQ4qJez4p0P0wHZBQeh6V4*SgvMCXBz5ReI5PpxM5QKdTuZtwG9d*8KIXQ32PmVjdD09eHoGSTpk8DCky8sOE5Vr-*q-/NewZoneThresholds.JPG)\n\n\n\nIt will take a bit of time for me to update this component to the new capabilities but, if you go with the additionalStrings route, it should work right out of the box with HB.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 01, 2016 at 05:19PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1609080", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1609319"}
