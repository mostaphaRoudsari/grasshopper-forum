{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for your hard work to update the components which work fine now!\n\n\n\nI noticed that the ddy file generated by the Run Simulation or the Export to OpenStudio components, in the case when only the EPW file is present, is different from the original ddy file downloaded from energyplus.net, at least for the Singapore EPW file. (both files attached)\n\n\n\nThe image attached shows the difference btw the original and the generated ddy files in terms of variables such as Maximum Dry-Bulb Temperature, Humidity Condition Type, Wetbulb or Dewpoint at Maximum Dry-Bulb, Barometric Pressure, Wind Speed, Wind Direction.\n\n\n\nMay I ask if these differences matter in the simulation, especially when using Ideal Loads Air System?\u00a0\n\n\n\nWill you recommend to always put the original ddy and epw files side by side in the same folder when conducting simulation?\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DLAtIY7YVfJRKr54N2R1py68Ywa7KUzTE23K3cpZ3DRx9J*4VzAKYyD0i1iqVGP3F9POxsb5k4aVTpppkZn825iJDN5wMlim/Image21.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DLAtIY7YVfJRKr54N2R1py68Ywa7KUzTE23K3cpZ3DRx9J*4VzAKYyD0i1iqVGP3F9POxsb5k4aVTpppkZn825iJDN5wMlim/Image21.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1571839", "name": "SGP_Singapore_generated.ddy"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1571840", "name": "SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.ddy"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "July 27, 2016 at 2:25am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "topic_1569930", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571838"}
