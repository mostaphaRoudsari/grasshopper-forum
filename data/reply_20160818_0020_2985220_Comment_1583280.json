{"body": "\nHi Ji,\n\n\n\nI went over this issue and I think this is a bug in BF currently.\n\n\n\nThe issue has to do with the way the initial conditions for turbulence properties are calculated. Smh the correct values are not passed on which makes the simulation diverge. I have already posted on this in github ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly/issues/54](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly/issues/54)) it should be fixed soon.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime I was wondering if you can help me validate this. In the file you attached here your initial conditions were:\n\n\n\nUref = 2m/s\n\nZref = 10m\n\nz0 = 0.005\n\n<br/>Your initial conditions file has the following k and epsilon values:\n\n\n\nk = 0.039\n\nepsilon = 0.031\n\n\n\nCould you please try manually changing them to the following values and re-running the case? You would have to run it manually as well so that BF won't overwrite your changes.\n\n\n\nk = 0.039\n\nepsilon = 0.0003\n\n\n\nThank you so much for testing!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "August 18, 2016 at 12:20AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579751", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1583280"}
