{"body": "\nHi Francesco,\n\nGlad to hear it works for you. I tested myself the BruteForce and it works exactly as the Propagator component.\n\nThey both use the Click button. They require the switch on/off and don't like the True/False option. Moreover, they require to switch to False in order to perform the action, or at least, to show the results. So i'll stick with the click.\n\nI think that the reason it runs the first one is not related to the BruteForce/Propagator but rather to that that the Run input is set to True. Don't see any work around this since this run must be set to true. Maybe if you kill the shell window for the first run it can save some time.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 4, 2015 at 1:55am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279833", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279602"}
