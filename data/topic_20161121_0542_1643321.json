{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI'm trying to understand how the tolerance works into the Solve\u00a0adjacencies honeybee component.\n\nI have two thermal zones with a distance between two surfaces 0.3 m from each other (se attached files). If I input a value of 0.35 into tolerance the idf file comes without the correct Outside Boundary Condition Object. If I input a value that is about 2 times greater (for example 0.62), the idf file has the correct boundary condition (the South surface of the first thermal Zone has the North Surface of the second Thermal Zone as boundary condition object).\n\n\n\nHow does the input value work?\n\n\n\nthank you very much!!\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1643320", "name": "HB_10.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1643280", "name": "00_box_3_beta.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Filippo", "created_at": "November 21, 2016 at 05:42AM", "created_by": "Filippo", "topic": "Solve adjacencies tolerance", "id": "topic_1643321"}
