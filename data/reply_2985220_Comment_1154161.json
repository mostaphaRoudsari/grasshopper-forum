{"body": "\nHi Albert,\n\nThank you for the kind comments.\n\nIf you add your installation folders to system paths, Honeybee should be able to find it. As far as the path doesn't have white spaces you should be fine.\n\nDo you have the folders included in the path? If you don't know, open a cmd window and type path and see if the folders are there. let me know if it didn't solve your issue and we can try an alternative solution.\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 22, 2014 at 5:31pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1153966", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1154161"}
