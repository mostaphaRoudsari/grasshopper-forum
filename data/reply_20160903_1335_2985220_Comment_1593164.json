{"body": "\nMona,\n\n\n\nYou don't need to worry about installing E+ for Honeybee if you install OpenStudio correctly. \u00a0OpenStudio includes a compatible version of E+ and Honeybee knows to use that one if it finds OpenStudio. \u00a0So you are better off installing the latest OpenStudio.\n\n\n\nIn any case, check to see if you have this folder:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\OpenStudio 1.12.0\n\n...or, in your case, this folder:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\OpenStudio 1.10.0\n\n\n\nIf you don't have at least one folder of this variety, then you do not have OpenStudio installed in the correct location on your system. \u00a0Try installing again taking the default install location.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 03, 2016 at 01:35PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1591289", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1593164"}
