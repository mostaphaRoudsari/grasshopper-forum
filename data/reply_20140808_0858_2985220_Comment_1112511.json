{"body": "\nHello Dan,\n\nI had your problem too and I solved it by this way:\n\n\n\nIt takes quite a lot (10 minutes), but you get all the data you need. I had a 72-point grid, so I had 72*8760 numbers. It's up to you manage the database you create: if you have a n-point grid the record you create is:\n\n\n\nthan you can manage all your record as you want. I used it to find the trend during the year to calculate with genetic\u00a0algorithm the electrical light requirement and see if it matched to Daysim. But actually, you can do whatever you want.\n\n\n\nGood luck,\n\nClaudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "August 08, 2014 at 08:58AM", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "parent_id": "topic_1112447", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1112511"}
