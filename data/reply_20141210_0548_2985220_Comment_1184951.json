{"body": "\nHi Chris,\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you as I didn't notice conductivity property in the blind tool (because I didn't expect it be there). Now I have more troubles as it is not very evident for me what do inputs \"zone data1...3_\" mean? Additionally what do I connect to _HBObjects? Windows or shading geometry? Then what is expected to come out of \"windowBreps\",\"shadeBreps\" and HBObjWShades? I ask as it was skipped in your video tutorials. If I am not correct, please give me a hint where I can find it.\n\n\n\nBut I am obviously curious of what is the best way to test elements that substitute each other according to the schedule. If this was a tool this would be EXTREMELY powerful as it one of fundamental strategies in adaptive architecture.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not know what happens behind the interface as before I have been an EDSL TAS user which is promoted at the AA school as user friendly).\n\n\n\nThe flow for the NatVent settings in the proposed settings is suitable for preliminary studies. However it would be helpful to control apertures by the weather data in a more tricky way. I mean that the input should be dynamic and obviously instead of using the outdoor temperature to open or close the window I would prefer to use the indoor DBT which appears dynamically while the conditions are calculated. Anyway you should know better!\n\n\n\nThank you for prompt help.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Artem Polomanyy", "created_at": "December 10, 2014 at 05:48AM", "created_by": "ArtemPolomanyy", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184835", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184951"}
