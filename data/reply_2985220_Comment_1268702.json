{"body": "\nHi Joyce\n\n\n\nYou can download a Hong Kong epw file by using the Ladybug_download EPW Weather File component\n\n\n\nThere are a number of ways to get this into GH but an easy way is to copy the Hong Kong shortcut and paste it into a panel in GH. Then plug that into Ladybug_Open EPW And STAT Weather Files and then plug that into your Landybug_Import EPW component as above.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nDuncan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1268704", "name": "EPW.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "April 21, 2015 at 10:09am", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "parent_id": "topic_1268913", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1268702"}
