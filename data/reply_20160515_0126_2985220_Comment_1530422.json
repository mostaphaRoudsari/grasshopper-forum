{"body": "\nHi Nick,I am working with Therm too. <br/> As Mauricio corrected me, I had missed convection and radiation transfer in my calculation, regarding conduction as the main transfer way for a solid. Still for a simple box of Aluminum, I expect an almost similar U-value and lambda, (not equal due to radiation and convection transfer) if the box is 1 m length. But the amounts are very very different. While Al- lambda is 237 W/m.k , Therm calculates the U of the assumed box 4.59 W/m^2.k . I guess this is because of my mistake in assumption of Hc factor, which I don't know how it should be defined.\n\nthe assumed Boundary condition for therm calculation was: <br/> (interior boundary Hc = 4.65 W/m.k and temp=21 centigrade<br/>\nexterior boundary Hc = 10 W/m.k and temp= -18 centigrade)\n\nIf I put 237 for Hc of both exterior and interior boundaries, the U-value would be 79.47 W/m^2.k.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Farnaz", "created_at": "May 15, 2016 at 01:26AM", "created_by": "Farnaz609", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1758248", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1530422"}
