{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\nExactly for the same reason that you said that the area of the surfaces are not the same we need to multiply the values by area before adding them together. Imagine you have a horizontal surface with area of 20 m2 vs another surface with area of 10 m2. If you use different grid sizes the result will stay the same in the current approach (and that's what the right value) but with your approach the value will be drastically effected by the grid size. For an extreme case think of a single test point in the center of both surfaces. They will show the same total values.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 28, 2015 at 06:15PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1411183", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1411460"}
