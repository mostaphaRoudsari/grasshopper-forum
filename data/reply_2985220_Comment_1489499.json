{"body": "\nDear Chris and Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for your clarification!\n\n\n\nYes, I agree with you that using \"Indoor operative temperature\" for the Y axis of the adaptive comfort chart might be less confusing, and plus it is consistent with what is presented in the ASHRAE standard.\n\n\n\nUsers should be able to use the outputs of this component to filter out those measurements within or outside the acceptable limits.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of the outputs of this component, I got the following issue which I'd like to have your advice:\n\n\n\nAs shown in the image, the output of the \"comfortableOrNot\" node has 2 branches and 17534 values, which is strange because the input epw file has only 8760 hourly data (8767 including the headers).\n\n\n\nSth must have caused the duplication, and I hope you can kindly point out what I missed here.\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/WlEYvnGKT6CdgDpz1k8y1Rk-igJbTH9LrY16OSkLJBuRmpu4l4J4DjzJxY8TjE5Yz9MFksjOV9AfyU8yA-ndho3nceMvH3zl/Image1.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/WlEYvnGKT6CdgDpz1k8y1Rk-igJbTH9LrY16OSkLJBuRmpu4l4J4DjzJxY8TjE5Yz9MFksjOV9AfyU8yA-ndho3nceMvH3zl/Image1.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1489500", "name": "thermal_comfort_calc_v002.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "March 21, 2016 at 8:39am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1488537", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489499"}
