{"body": "\nNishant,\n\nThere something very important to note here. The HVAC system that you're applying is Chilled Beams + DOAS. This is a central system so electricity is consumed at the chiller plant level and therefore, you're not receiving zonewise\u00a0cooling energy. I believe that's the real reason why you're not able to visualize results for zones.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "February 08, 2017 at 01:07AM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1687348", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1687240"}
