{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, all,\u00a0\n\n\n\nNice feedback and very interesting topic!\n\n\n\nThe layers of a green roof depend always on the type (extensive, graveled, paved, intensive) that has to do with the type/size of vegetation and the substrates you need to use for each type and of course from the manufacturer. I am attaching\u00a0[a link](http://www.knaufinsulation.co.uk/media/786396/2_5-green-roofs.pdf) to an example manufacturer where there is an explanation of potential layers and options. Also please check this [link](http://www.optigruen.de/fileadmin/contents/Prospekte/1_Planungsunterlage/Optigruen-Planungsunterlage.pdf)\u00a0(in German) for an extremely elaborated breakdown of greenroof types and material used for each type. Finally this [report](http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/media/newsletters/brpost/winter2006/ASHRAEJeffSonne.pdf)\u00a0from\u00a0Ashrae Journal in 2006 that claims that Green roofs are expected to have various R values across their span from R-17 in the middle to R-38 at the edges. Based on the last paper I would say that is indeed very difficult to simulate one very precisely and I don't know if there is a good reason to do so if you know the layers and R-values of each layer and you want to evaluate potential benefits in an early design stage.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately I havent done any similar simulation in HB but I am planning to for the project I work on. I will probably stick to this level of detail though and will not try to elaborate further. I did simulate some green roofs with Ecotect some 3-4 years ago and the results were at least as expected!\n\nHope this helps!\u00a0\n\n\n\nTasos\u00a0\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "March 12, 2015 at 05:16AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1241036", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1241146"}
