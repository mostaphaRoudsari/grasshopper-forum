{"body": "\nHi Ladybug team,\n\nI just seem to bump into different issues with honeybee lately. Please see attached definition to check if these problems occur:\n\n1) Latest changes in Github did not show up when updating Hb using the component - had to download directly and overwrite files.\n\n2) Colorsurfaces component returns this: Solution exception:name 'lb_preparation' is not defined. I don't remember this being an issue earlier but now it won't go away unless I plug a slider to 'stepsOfSimulation' and then unplug.\n\n3) PETrecipe component returns this: Solution exception:global name 'Icl' is not defined. Goes away if value is unplugged from clothinginsulation @ bodycharacteristics component.\n\n4) AdaptRecipe component returns null for outdoor case with minimal inputs (worked fine earlier)\n\n5) Decompose EPmaterial: the last value (visual absorbance?) is missing from comments\n\n\n\nand a less technical question (so that I won't flood the forum with more threads): Can ecoroof material be used to simulate grass on ground? I did an experiment and I got higher surface-temp results than concrete and no indications of shadow effect from obstacles. I'd post this def. but I bumped into the above problems.\n\n-Aris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1752368", "name": "colorzones_issue.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Aris V", "created_at": "May 16, 2017 at 6:49am", "created_by": "ArisVartholomaios", "topic": "lb_preparation not defined (and some other stuff)", "id": "topic_1752369"}
