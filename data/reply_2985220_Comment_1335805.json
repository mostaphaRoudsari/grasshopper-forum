{"body": "\nHi, Chris, thanks for your advices!\n\n\n\nThe view I want to get is actually like a view looking out from a window. The Rhino's orientCameraToSrf is actually doing the opposite of want I want.\n\n\n\nBut I figure out a way to do it: create a small line section positioned at the centroid of a surface and align with the normal of the surface, and it will be used a reference to define a camera view by camera and target positions. (see Rhino file attached).\n\n\n\nAnyway, I figured out the workflow for view-based image rendering (perspective/fisheye) and grid-based Daylight Factor simulation in HB.\n\n\n\nCan you advise on how to color the analysis mesh, although I can visualize the DF value on analysis points?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/YoqhN--8jZdEztQChhqCWerPYqJBUuByZbtXWDndNy0CozwM0zzj1iL5RLvKDmoFEpg7o4bS4mO2fEPHo*1QbQgkue-Ui2BQ/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/YoqhN--8jZdEztQChhqCWerPYqJBUuByZbtXWDndNy0CozwM0zzj1iL5RLvKDmoFEpg7o4bS4mO2fEPHo*1QbQgkue-Ui2BQ/Capture.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1335807", "name": "AR2521_Radiance_v004.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1335808", "name": "view_v001.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 3, 2015 at 1:01am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1335758", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1335805"}
