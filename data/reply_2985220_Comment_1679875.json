{"body": "\nAmir,\n\nTo echo Mostapha's sentiment here, the world of HVAC (and especially very innovative HVAC) is so vast that we cannot possibly write all the scripts to enable this within the Honeybee community alone. \u00a0However, OpenStudio team has set up infrastructure for people to write custom ruby scripts with the OpenStudio API (called Measures) and simply run these scripts to apply highly custom, innovated HVAC systems to OpenStudio models. \u00a0What is even better is that they have set up the Building Components Library (BCL) so that people can share these scripts and the innovation of our community can grow! \u00a0Here is the list of scripts tat have been shared so far:\n\n[https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site?f](https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site?f)[0]=im_field_measure_tags%3A956\n\nAfter the (very soon) release of OpenStudio 2.0, the format for measures will be standardized and we will be able to finish a couple of components that allow you to apply measures to your model with Grasshopper (without the current bugs). \u00a0The biggest advantage of this workflow is that you can have custom inputs for each type of HVAC (ie. the number of boreholes on a Ground Source Heat Pump system).\n\nOnce OpenStudio team finishes this standardization, I have the working implementation of the \"Run Measures\" component as the last thing I will add to the legacy Honeybee before going full force on Honeybee[+]. \u00a0Any future HVAC templates that I make for my office or other work (ie. GSHP system templates) will be implemented as Measures and shared through the OpenStudio BCL.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 28, 2017 at 1:24pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1677329", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1679875"}
