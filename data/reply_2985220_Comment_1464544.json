{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI think it would be easy for you to actually make it work with the existing recipe-based workflow that currently exists in Honeybee.\n\n\n\nOn a very fundamental level getting Photon mapping to work basically requires the creation of an amb file for all the photons through mkpmap. Based on the discussion that I had with David during the workshop, the thing that isn't completely settled as far as Photon Mapping goes is the selection of number of photons and bandwidth for creating the photons. However, since then I have noticed a troubleshooting table at the end of the Photon Mapping manual. So, perhaps everything is stable now.\n\n\n\nI am fairly certain that I can write a hack for the existing Honeybee workflow to make it work with Photon Mapping. We could use that example to create a proper implementation in Honeybee. I will update you guys in a few days.\n\n\n\n(By the way, I totally agree with your comment about proper warnings and Greg's slide about choosing the best method.)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "February 16, 2016 at 2:17pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1464475", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1464544"}
