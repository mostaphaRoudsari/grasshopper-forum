{"body": "\nWell,\n\nThe idf file runs fine in my computer. I'm sure that if you run it manually in yours it will run too. No reason why not. Also sure the E+ is well installed.\n\nWhen i see the BAT file i only can suppose that there are issues with the path. Just for the sake of this, can you change the path of this file in GH? Maybe use default values (No working directory defined). Maybe in the computer you are using there is no E disk?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 23, 2015 at 9:28pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1292816", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1293816"}
