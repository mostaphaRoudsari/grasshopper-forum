{"body": "\nHi all! Very interesting.\n\nChris, I have two minor comments that you may want to consider.\n\n1. I think you need to catch the errors either in smaller part of the code or by considering type of exception so you can give a more related warning/error message.\n\n2. You may also want to give a warning to the user in cases that you are using the alternate methodology.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 1, 2015 at 10:14pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1233886", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1234552"}
