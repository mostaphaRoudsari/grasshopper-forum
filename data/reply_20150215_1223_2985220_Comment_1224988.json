{"body": "\nHi Tasos, hi everybody!\n\n\n\nI follow your discussion with great interest and I am looking forward to your plug-in!\n\n\n\nAs part of my Ph.D. project I developed a plug-in that Daniel mentioned earlier in his post ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVXCc3bSAxc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVXCc3bSAxc)). Once I have it cleaned up, I would be happy to publish it here. I employed the plug-in for a case study, which can be found [here](http://www.bso14.org/BSO14_Papers/BSO14_Paper_048.pdf).\n\n\n\nUp to now, I haven't worked with ladybug/honeybee yet, I used the ArchSim plug-in by Timur. For the EPDs I accessed the free German [\u00f6kobau.dat](http://oekobaudat.de/home.html). Nevertheless, I am very interested in working together to have LCA plug-in\u00a0compatible with different national databanks or EPDs. I'd be happy to help!\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\nAlex\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alexander Hollberg", "created_at": "February 15, 2015 at 12:23PM", "created_by": "Alex392", "parent_id": "topic_1224534", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1224988"}
