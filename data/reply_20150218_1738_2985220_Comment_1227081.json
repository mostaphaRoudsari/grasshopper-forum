{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nOnce I removed the zone that was not closed in your file and I updated your view factor component to the latest version, all seemed to be good.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/wdDZeipuIRxi54ElDLI64cEbdhXSyhXxso60NP5uXDnn6Dzns3OePfHRA6sIdrayCa--1aG8mfnr4FnRNYsw218jRWq5ll9S/GoodIndoorTempStudy.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/wdDZeipuIRxi54ElDLI64cEbdhXSyhXxso60NP5uXDnn6Dzns3OePfHRA6sIdrayCa--1aG8mfnr4FnRNYsw218jRWq5ll9S/GoodIndoorTempStudy.PNG)\n\nI think that the preivew issue that you mentioned is the same as the bug that I posted about on the general grasshopper group (see the link). \u00a0Hopefully the GH team will fix it in their next version of grasshopper. \u00a0As the thread says, you can temporarily fix the problem by turning off the breps previewing in the Rhino scene.\n\n\n\nA note about shading in the comfort map: if you add shading into the E+ simulation, you should be sure to either drop down the transmissivity of the windows in the Adaptive Comfort Recipe component or plug in the shadeBreps of the Window Shade Generator into the additionalShading input of the View Factor component (the latter is more accurate but it takes the view factor component longer to run). \u00a0Doing either of these will ensure that direct sunlight falling on the occupants is minimized in the case of shades. \u00a0Here's how your image changes when you account for the shades blocking direct sun on occupants:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/wdDZeipuIRyjTkNNtvV77LCBzgJSmr52OACdFuz69hAa5pqULIm3ItsUiOZCZsEm0PiZUIXPRMA9YTgTrocTusQHpp4Wgpcr/ShadesOnOccuants.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/wdDZeipuIRyjTkNNtvV77LCBzgJSmr52OACdFuz69hAa5pqULIm3ItsUiOZCZsEm0PiZUIXPRMA9YTgTrocTusQHpp4Wgpcr/ShadesOnOccuants.PNG)\n\nSee attached GH file.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1227082", "name": "OfficeTower_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 18, 2015 at 05:38PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1226470", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1227081"}
