{"body": "\nHi Nora!\n\nGlad to see that you are on the Grasshopper forums and thanks for posting.\n\nBoth the GH file that you have uploaded and the original example file on my dropbox run well on my system. \u00a0It seems that we are looking at an issue that is specific to your system.\n\nI think that there's a good chance that you did not install all of the OpenStudio libraries. \u00a0If you could post a screenshot of a panel connected to the output of the HB_HB component of the original example file, we will know for sure (check if it says the same thing as mine does in the image below).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/*E1*lxSss-egbvzfuntRSk-VzYQVTU88nsVoi5feQitlP-I422Fl15QIZeDF*lPRJUDmFpPbE4GtU1JonqOOGzg1nmG2jASZ/EPRunOK.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/*E1*lxSss-egbvzfuntRSk-VzYQVTU88nsVoi5feQitlP-I422Fl15QIZeDF*lPRJUDmFpPbE4GtU1JonqOOGzg1nmG2jASZ/EPRunOK.PNG)\n\nIf this is the error, the way to solve it is to download the openStudio libraries from here:\n\n[https://app.box.com/s/bh9sbpgajdtmmystv3n4](https://app.box.com/s/bh9sbpgajdtmmystv3n4)\n\nand copy the contents of the zip file into both C:\\ladybug and\u00a0C:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\n\nLet me know if that fixes it.\n\n\n\nAlso, it is generally a not a good idea to mix versions of LB_LB and HB_HB components with other components that are not the same version. \u00a0I imagine that this could become a source of error and so I would suggest starting again from the original example file on the dropbox.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 12, 2015 at 10:47pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1203295", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1203466"}
