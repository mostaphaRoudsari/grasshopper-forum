{"body": "\nHi Will, I checked your file again and one common mistake that I can see is creating couple of different materials with the same name. In this case one will overwrite the other cases. You need to select a unique name for each material.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/u-nuBgwJg3yywlVgzVHFT4FlPKCU8O2AF0dkSoHrpyA8PrLsvq60hZdG-G1Iqg-hUBmQ5*pgkZjLrGU*hKhcuKFoz3-jhsiF/materialNames.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/u-nuBgwJg3yywlVgzVHFT4FlPKCU8O2AF0dkSoHrpyA8PrLsvq60hZdG-G1Iqg-hUBmQ5*pgkZjLrGU*hKhcuKFoz3-jhsiF/materialNames.png)\n\nMy guess is that because of the order of the surfaces in one of the cases this order has been reversed. You can check the material assigned to each surface also from importRAD. Materials and surfaces branching should match.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 4, 2014 at 11:11pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1181423", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1181289"}
