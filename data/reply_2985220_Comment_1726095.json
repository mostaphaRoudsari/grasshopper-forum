{"body": "\nHi Djordje!\n\nWe've started to study your reply, just one quick question, in the example file you provided, in the \"context\" surface for the \"Ladybug Sunpath Shading\" calculation, shouldn't we put inside also the ground surface (that is used to create the analysis grid). This way even if it dosen't shade the grid points its influence on the calculation can be considered as reflection through the albedo default value of the component.\n\n\n\nkind regards!<br/><br/>Filippo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Filippo", "created_at": "April 3, 2017 at 3:35am", "created_by": "Filippo", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1721289", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726095"}
