{"body": "\nJulia,\n\nThank you for doing this validation and comparison of natural ventilation cases. \u00a0I have to admit that you are well beyond territory that I have tread in EnergyPlus. \u00a0If you are getting an error that is telling you to contact E+ team, you will probably get more help from them by posting on unmethours:\n\n[https://unmethours.com/questions/](https://unmethours.com/questions/)\n\nor to the EnergyPlus github as an issue (searching current issues is also a good idea):\n\n[https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/issues](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/issues)\n\nI tried to run your file but it seems that you forgot to internalize one of the glazing geometry surfaces. \u00a0Also, I don't have any of your CSV schedules on my system and, as a result, I was not able to recreate your error. \u00a0If you upload a GH file with these things fixed, I can have a look at recreating the issue.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 20, 2016 at 06:53PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1660323", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1660957"}
