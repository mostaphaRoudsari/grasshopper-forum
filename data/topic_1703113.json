{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nI have been looking at the Honeybee microclimate maps to evaluate external thermal comfort in Dubai. I was looking at the MRT results for shaded and non shaded areas and it seems that we have a difference of \u00a050\u00b0C between shaded and exposed areas. Moreover, MRT goes as high as 110\u00b0C in exposed aeras, does that seem plausible? Is anyone aware of measuring campaign in those areas?\n\nAttached is a benchmark script.\n\nThanks for your help,\n\n- Nicolas\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1703111", "name": "MRT benchmark.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1703112", "name": "2017-03-01 11_29_51-Untitled - Rhinoceros 5.0 Commercial - [Top].png"}], "created_by_name": "Nicolas Chaulet", "created_at": "March 1, 2017 at 4:30am", "created_by": "NicolasChaulet", "topic": "MRT in hot climate", "id": "topic_1703113"}
