{"body": "\nHi Olivier,\n\n\n\nHave you made sure you updated BF before running the case? There was an error in creating initial conditions and cases would diverge.\n\n\n\nThis is what seems has happened to your case. If you see, the results indicated in the error for pressure are, well I don't think I know the name for those numbers. But values of XE+118 mean the simulation was diverging. I would recommend you to update BF, if you haven't already, re-run the case and test after.\n\n<br/>Also, you can post your mesh settings here. Most other times is mesh quality causing this.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "August 22, 2016 at 08:14PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1574828", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1586335"}
