{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm having the following issue: I'm defining various zones based only on surfaces. There are 4 floors with about 3 zones per floor.\n\nWhen i create each floor and apply SolveAdjacencies it went OK.\n\nBut when i apply it for all floors together some of them doesn't show.\n\nI need to say that for the zones definition the ceiling surface of one zone is the floor for the other in the floor above it.\n\nI believe, and hope, the attached file is clear enough to see the problem (The rightmost adjacency is the whole building).\n\nWhat i'm missing?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1174962", "name": "Caldwell.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 24, 2014 at 02:58PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "Zones from Syrfaces and Solve Adjacencies", "id": "topic_1174963"}
