{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nhi guys,\n\nI was trying to find out a proper solution to a problem close to the topic of this discussion(achieve a UTCI of an outdoor area in front of a specific reflective surface);\n\nI have doubts that I want to share with you:\n\n- strange results: if you run the simulation twice(same input data in all the components) you will have different Solar Flux results: how is it possible? please have a look to the first gh file attached.\n\n-if you change the human body with a surface grid(to obtain different values on a give surface of study) and try to change the analysis period \u00a0into August for instance, you will see strange values; in some cases there are almost 2 degrees(\u00b0C) of difference between two closer grid points(I think we all agree that is a quite weird result, isn't it?)_please have a look and run the simulation of the second gh file attached.\n\nMaybe Radiance is not the proper way to give a solution to our problem?\u00a0\n\nthank u in advance,\n\nplease let me know what you think,\n\nErn\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1616299", "name": "ComfortableAnalysis_v1_CWM2_ERN.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1616300", "name": "ComfortableAnalysis_v1_CWM2_GRID.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ernesto Cesario", "created_at": "October 11, 2016 at 04:59AM", "created_by": "ErnestoCesario", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1346924", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1616297"}
