{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\n\nI'm having a bit of trouble figuring out the right approach for something..\u00a0\n\nI'd like to model a wall which has pipes embedded in the walls acting as heat exchangers throughout the day. I'd like to optimize the size of pipe, number of pipes, location etc etc using software like Therm which outputes a heat map.\n\n\n\nThing is, I'm having difficulty linking this up to Galapagos/Octopus since each run of analysis requires you to open up Therm Seperately, run an analysis and re-import it into GH.\u00a0\n\n\n\n... Any Suggestions how to go about this? Is there a way to perform the analysis entire through grasshopper so it can be easily linked to Galapagos etc.?\n\n\n\nthanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris bc", "created_at": "April 10, 2017 at 2:03pm", "created_by": "Chrisbc", "topic": "Thermal Wall Optimization", "id": "topic_1730805"}
