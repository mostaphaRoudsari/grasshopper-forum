{"body": "\nHi Mostapha &amp; everyone,\n\n\n\nI am exploring form finding for \"environmental performance\" (excluding structurla at this phase) \u00a0using as a reference your paper \"**BUILDING SIMULATION AND EVOLUTIONARY OPTIMIZATION IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A HIGH-PERFORMANCE OFFICE BUILDING**\".\n\nI want to be able to have 3D results of generations as in your : video\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYw7KexxThM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYw7KexxThM)\n\n\n\nIs it possible to do it without Matlab? and how would the workflow be?\n\n\n\nThanks for any insight,\n\n\n\nNita\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ltz8IQUQkiIkqYQPheVRxtHT*7Wn9stMEN94szrTMU7gtVDq3HU9l11pFJfuZD8w5uVEyGRU1Ejl9v9ovM00YlvJ2TDAAvdd/formoptimization.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ltz8IQUQkiIkqYQPheVRxtHT*7Wn9stMEN94szrTMU7gtVDq3HU9l11pFJfuZD8w5uVEyGRU1Ejl9v9ovM00YlvJ2TDAAvdd/formoptimization.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nit\u00eb", "created_at": "May 12, 2015 at 5:02am", "created_by": "Nita", "topic": "Baking geometry results after optimization with Octopus", "id": "topic_1285314"}
