{"body": "\nHi Cheney,\n\n\n\nI believe HB has a rotation study in one of the components but you can replicate that function quite easily in GH.\n\n\n\nIf your model is quite simple, and only used for daylighting, you can simply plug in its Brep to a rotate component and connect the output to the Run component. Then you can add a slider or values of the degrees you want it to rotate and use the fly component to run all values off of that. If you have true in your daylighting workflow that should generate parametric runs for you. Ofc, if I believe you can do the same thing on the North input of the Run components in HB.\n\n\n\nJust remember to link each run to a different file name in the Run daylighting component so you don't overwrite your results each time (a concatanate component to do smth like NameOfSimulation_#Run would be enough).\n\n\n\nThere are other, a bit more intricate ways, which actually provide much more functionality and ease of working (once you are more comfortable with GH) if you create the model itself parametrically in GH. Then you just use a similar method to all the parameters that can be influenced.\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n\nKind regards,<br/>Theodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 30, 2016 at 12:36AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519245", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519418"}
