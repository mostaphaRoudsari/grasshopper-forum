{"body": "\nNo need to remove and install from fresh!!!\n\nJust insert the updateHoneybee/Ladybug and connect a toggle boolean TRUE to the _updateAllUObjects and _updateThisFile inputs.\n\nThe first will sync the User objects globally (with the github) and the second will update your open file with your own library.\n\nAfter that if any component is giving you such kind of errors just reinsert them from the tabs of HB or LB. This becouse sometimes there are changes in the number of input/output items that the update process can't handle.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-A&gt;\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 23, 2016 at 8:44am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1623488", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1623493"}
