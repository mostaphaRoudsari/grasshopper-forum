I'd like to skip doing this in rhino because Therm actually seems a lot less hassle in this case since it has a one-click function.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Derin Yilmaz", "created_at": "March 14, 2016 at 11:46AM", "created_by": "DerinYilmaz", "topic": "Therm workflow question / comment", "id": "topic_1484413"}
