{"body": "\nBen,\n\n\n\nFrom the what you describe and re-reading Mostapha's comments, it sounds like it is an issue with copying things to the memory of your system (or the \"sticky\" that Mostapha mentioned). \u00a0I attached a file that has a GHPython component that just copies stuff to the memory and another that reads it back. \u00a0Let me know if you are able to open the and get a number in the panel in the file. If not, this may be a question that we need to field to the makers of GHPython.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1141348", "name": "sticky test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 1, 2014 at 8:53pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1140349", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1141347"}
