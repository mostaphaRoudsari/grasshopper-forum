{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nI see what's happening. It is because of the order that Grasshopper executes the script. For some reason it does execute the LB AnalysisPeriod before LB_Ladybug component, so when\u00a0LB AnalysisPeriod looks for Ladybug it is not there and it gives you the warning.\n\nJust changing Ladybug to True afterward doesn't help since LB AnalysisPeriod is not constantly listening to changes.\u00a0You need to re-execute the\u00a0LB AnalysisPeriod again after Ladybug is released to make it work.\n\nI'll send you an email. Thank you for your understanding and support!\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 18, 2013 at 3:13pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_874612", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_874450"}
