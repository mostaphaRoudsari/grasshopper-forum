{"body": "\nHi Sarith,\n\nThanks for your answer and your time. After two hours of work the file now run. I get your results. And the problem is incredible. First I tryed to update each component because often this was the problem with this kind of error. But it didn't help in this case. Finally I see something strange in the information I get from the panel that has as input the file path of my luminaire. The problem is that selecting a file path on my desktop the address stored for that file had two space between the words ( it was \" \\parans M1 small.IES\"). Changing the file's name into \"\\paransM1small.IES\" now it works fine.\n\n\n\nNow, the second problem is: I can controll the shading using a sensor or multiple sensors; the shading is open and closed when the sensor register less or more illuminance threshold . My intention is to switch off and on the lights ( they are system for bringing natural light when the sun is shining) at the same time the shading is open and closed. So the project should be: when the sun is shining the shadings are closed and the light on, when the sky is cloudy the shadings are open and the lights are off. I use daysim for climate based analysis with dynamic shading but now I don't know how add the contribute of the light in the annual analysis using this criteria and if it is possible.\n\nI hope I exlplain well the problem\n\nThanks in advance\u00a0\n\n\n\nDavid M\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Maimone", "created_at": "February 13, 2016 at 09:32AM", "created_by": "DavidMaimone", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1461725", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462266"}
