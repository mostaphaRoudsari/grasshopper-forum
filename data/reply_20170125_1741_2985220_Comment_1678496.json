{"body": "\nHi Devang, Thank you for the detailed reply. Great suggestions.\n\n---\n\n1. Can you share an example of the checklist? I would say the better idea is to create quality-check components based on these checklists/best practice approaches. We can definitely implement this in [+] components. For CFD Ilker had a similar idea but for post processing the results and give feedback based on the accuracy of the results.\n\n2. Testing inside Grasshopper is challenging.\u00a0[We started it here](https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybee-plus/issues/4#issuecomment-195815455) but then it stopped. For the python code itself it's must and [we are already writing tests for the new development](https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybee/tree/master/tests).\n\n---\n\n1. Totally! The new development is well documented and that's how [we're generating this API documentation](http://ladybug-analysis-tools.github.io/honeybee/doc/hbsurface.m.html). It might be too much work for the legacy version, and also if everything goes as planned we should retire the legacy version at some point soon.\n\n2. Thanks!\n\n---\n\nThank you for the feedback! Really helpful.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 25, 2017 at 05:41PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678049", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678496"}
