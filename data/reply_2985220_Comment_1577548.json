{"body": "\nJust a note about Theodore's parallel processing suggestion: because the parallel processing of the daylight studies is so simple (it's literally just one core per simulation), I don't think that you should have to use those commands. \u00a0These commands seem very relevant to CFD parallel processing, however, since you often need the cores to talk to one another when running parallel CFD studies. \u00a0As such, overriding the default tendency to run everything on one or a few cores for the CFD seems to be necessary.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 6, 2016 at 11:10am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1577166", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1577548"}
