{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\nI am still trying to solve my problem, :D\n\nI tried Galapagos and Octopus for optimizing the angle of exterior LS and length of interior LS, but the Rhinoceros stops working during calculation.\n\nI think the problem must be something with lightshelf surface.\n\nShould I connect LightShelf geometry like other parts of zone such as roof, walls, etc. as a HB surface to HB zone?\n\nMostafa said: \"In any case you need to model light-shelves as separate surfaces and not part of the zone.\" in this discussion:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/appcrash-fa...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/appcrash-fault-modul-opennurbsx64-dll?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1356278&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\n\n\n\nbut I didn't understand what to do, and where should these surfaces be connected.\n\nI have attached a primary sample file.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1364770", "name": "5-2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Fahimeh Motazedian", "created_at": "September 19, 2015 at 06:42AM", "created_by": "FahimehMotazedian", "topic": "Lightshelf as a HB zone surface?", "id": "topic_1364771"}
