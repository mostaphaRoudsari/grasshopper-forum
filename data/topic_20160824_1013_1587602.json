{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\n\n\nI'm working on the design of a passiv mobile shading device for a hospital in Nantes, France.\n\nThe main idea is to replace mechanical louvers by a more architectural shading screen, whose shading factor to be correlated to the irradiation. The track we are following is using bimetal elements, like the work of **[Doris Sungs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V17Lp1X0_ao)**\n\nWe have already established the physical behaviour of the bimetal element, in function of the temperature and determined the best size and shape for tiles to sustain wind pressure. The shapes we have kept are triangle, rectangle, and trapeze. So we are able to make a grasshopper component that gives the shape as an output of a temperature input.\n\n\n\nNext problem is to determine the temperature of the bimetal tile exposed to sun, air temperature and speed. As a first step, I will suppose air is calm, so I believe the main factor for temperature raise is sun exposure.\n\n\n\nDo you have any idea to start that work ?\n\n\n\nThanks to you all.\n\nRegards\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Frehel Denis", "created_at": "August 24, 2016 at 10:13AM", "created_by": "FrehelDenis", "topic": "Bimetal shading", "id": "topic_1587602"}
