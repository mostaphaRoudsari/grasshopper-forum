{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and group members,\n\n\n\nI made a model with variable shape and window rate. I would like to use Galapagos to optimize the \u00a0shape and window rate for lowest energy consumption.\n\nHere is three questions\uff1a\n\n1. As the optimization goes, more and more errors of zones appeared, and the line of Galapagos seemed confusing.\n\n2. When I checked the result again with the push of bottom \"Reinstate\", the previous \u00a0total energy calculation turned \"undefined\".\n\n3. The error is all about \"All of your HBSrfs must make a closed volume\".\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/xE1-ufgwx-9jHr07dHUuhR-OtJ4PScN0W1ebvGeQd6RoYfcf4su*oLHKQM3WCtQh*7Ae78xviuLygD3BysBRl9XWdTtaLE*Y/QQ20161117010135.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/xE1-ufgwx-9jHr07dHUuhR-OtJ4PScN0W1ebvGeQd6RoYfcf4su*oLHKQM3WCtQh*7Ae78xviuLygD3BysBRl9XWdTtaLE*Y/QQ20161117010135.png)\n\nI attached the gh file. I'll appreciate it if you give me a hand.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1640504", "name": "Stage02_Optimization_3.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "November 16, 2016 at 10:18am", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "topic": "Honeybee_Energy Optimization with Galapagos_Erro", "id": "topic_1640505"}
