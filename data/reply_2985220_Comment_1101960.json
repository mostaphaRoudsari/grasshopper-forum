{"body": "\nHi Justin,\n\n\n\nI guess you are using meshes (and not breps) for analysis. In this case Ladybug assumes you already taken care of face sizes so it doesn't regenerate the mesh. The scattered points are based on your input mesh. This feature let the user use any custom grid that fits their design.\n\n\n\nThere are two solutions for this:\n\n1. Convert test meshes to brep, and use them for the analysis. Brep input will be meshed based on your input for grid size. You don't need to do it for context, just for what you connect to input geometry.\n\n\n\n2. Generate the appropriate mesh yourself using any of the other Grasshopper plugins.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 14, 2014 at 5:44pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1101890", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1101960"}
