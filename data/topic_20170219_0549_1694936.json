{"body": "\nHi\u00a0\n\nI have installed the latest version of BF v3 and OpenFoam v1612.. but when I run BlockMesh component in Grasshopper, I get a severe error regarding Openfoam ...\n\n\n\n1. Solution exception:Failed to find container id.Do you have the OpenFOAM container running?<br/>You can initiate OpenFOAM container by running start_OF.bat:<br/>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ESI\\OpenFOAM\\1612\\\\Windows\\Scripts\\start_OF.bat\n\n\n\nI have read other Issue problems such as\u00a0[#1](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/butterfly-test-simulation-for-case-with-fvscheme-updated-is-not)\u00a0,\u00a0[#2](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/butterfly-block-mesh-error)\u00a0,\u00a0[#3](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/butterfly-doesn-t-work-with-opefoam-v1606)\u00a0or OpenFoam Installation instructions but till now I couldn't run the simulation .. I figured out there is sth wrong with my openfoam installation where there should be a container called of-plusv1612-centos66 that openfoam must read it but it can not find it .. I checked with docker quickstart terminal as showed in pictures .. It could read the image but can not find the of-plusv1612 container ..\u00a0\n\n\n\nDo you have any suggestions?\n\n\u00a0\n\nP.S. I have opened all the possible files with or without administrator permissions but wasn't solved ..\n\nThanks \u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1694933", "name": "of-start container power shell.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1694934", "name": "docker.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1694935", "name": "start-of.bat.png"}], "created_by_name": "AMIR TABADKANI", "created_at": "February 19, 2017 at 05:49AM", "created_by": "AMIRTABADKANI", "topic": "OpenFoam Error in Butterfly (BlockMesh)", "id": "topic_1694936"}
