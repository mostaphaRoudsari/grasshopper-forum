{"body": "\nArpan,\n\nYour specific question about the fan is helpful narrows down the topic a lot. \u00a0Still, there are a number of variables related to the fan that have the words \"Fan Power\" in them. \u00a0In particular, if you open an OSM in OPenStudio and click on a fan, you see there's \"Fan Power Minimum Flow Rate Input Method\", \"Fan Power Minimum Flow Fraction\" and several \"Fan Power Coefficients\".\n\nYou can see on the Honeybee airDetails component that I give you the option to override many aspects of the fan like the fanEfficiency and the fanPressureRise. \u00a0If you need the ability to change one of the fan power variables, just let me know and I can add it into the airDetails component.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 26, 2016 at 6:51am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571168", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571268"}
