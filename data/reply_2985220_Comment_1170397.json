{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nTesting your file I've found a bug with the runDaylightAnalysis OR\u00a0readAnnualResultsI components. I gave an input in the _numOfCPUs_ (4). The simulation went fine but after it finished the readAnnualResultsI component complains about an unmatched number of points (**1. Number of points in ill files: 10 doesn't match the number of points in point files: 43**). Running with 1 CPU is ok.\n\nOr i'm missing something ...\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 17, 2014 at 11:42am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1170166", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1170397"}
