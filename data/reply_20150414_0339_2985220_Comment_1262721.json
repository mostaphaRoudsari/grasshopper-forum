{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nI am not quite sure about the answer.Of course the conversion might be time consuming.The idea was to compare the results between HB and EP while keeping the geometry and/use input data that were already set in EnergyPlus.\n\n1. The Rhino to E+ was very complex because of the geometry(I didn't work on that).\n\n\n\n2. Assuming that I want to import while keeping the geometry(as it is on the .idf I sent to you), what would the workflow be?\n\nIs it the problem at the .idf, or I have to go back to Rhino and remodel?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-N\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nit\u00eb", "created_at": "April 14, 2015 at 03:39AM", "created_by": "Nita", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262237", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262721"}
