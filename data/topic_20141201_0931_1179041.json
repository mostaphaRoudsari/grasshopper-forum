{"body": "\nHi,\u00a0\n\nI had the following error in this script to find out the MRT distribution in a room:\u00a0\n\n**\"1. None of the connected srfIndoorTemp could be matched with the connected surface names and view factors. Note that this component does not currenlty work for curved geometry E+ simulations because the surfaces are broken up and meshed in order to run it through E+.\"**\n\nThe thing is it worked the first time I run the simulation but then I changed some parameters and I have not been able to make it work again.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KBI*TiKs6pKJq6zfWQX2prnmcvEojIyHQ27pXQBhgarfXl21IUJhmI4iBC8*t98VHuAxOfl-WZ5tMobRwZHCiwqBl4Fzsi7N/Capture2.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KBI*TiKs6pKJq6zfWQX2prnmcvEojIyHQ27pXQBhgarfXl21IUJhmI4iBC8*t98VHuAxOfl-WZ5tMobRwZHCiwqBl4Fzsi7N/Capture2.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1179040", "name": "141110_Mean Radiant Temperature - grid over a room error.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "December 01, 2014 at 09:31AM", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Error with HB_indoor radiant temperature map", "id": "topic_1179041"}
