For instance in an exterior condition where a building reflects sunlight onto a specific area.\u00a0I will like to now which are the rays\u00a0reflecting from the SourceSrf that reaches a given\u00a0target area (a park or house) As the component not only shows reflected rays it also draws the sunrays tha directly touch any context geometry.\n\n\n\nthank you\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "February 14, 2015 at 08:13PM", "created_by": "Claudio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223846", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1224764"}
