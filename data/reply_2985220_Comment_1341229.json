{"body": "\nChris,\n\nThanks for the debugging help.\n\nWhich component did you fix? Radiation_analysis or Analysis_period?\n\n\n\nAlso, can you explain why if I \"flip\" a surface (change the direction of the normal through the rhino command line) the radiation values change? I was expecting the radiation value to go to zero. That is one side gives a value when exposed to the sun and the value would go to zero when this same side is turned away from the sun due to flipping the surface and it being hidden by context...\n\n\n\nThank you\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "dustin", "created_at": "August 10, 2015 at 10:39am", "created_by": "dustin836", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1338640", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1341229"}
