{"body": "\nIf this is hijacking I hope someone to hijack every single discussion that we have here. This looks great and I think we should add it to Honeybee official release.

Looking forward for a PR after you have extrude curve added.\n\nMostapha\u00a0\n\n\n\nPS: I'm [finally] checking the electrical light files tonight!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1388751", "name": "extrudeCurve.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 28, 2015 at 06:52PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1388746", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1388750"}
