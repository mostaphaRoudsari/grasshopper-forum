{"body": "\nHello Mostapha and Chris,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if you also think that an EMS component would be a great addition for Honeybee.\n\n\n\nIn my part of the world, all green building construction has to have an EMS system installed. It would be great for us engineers to show the predicted impact of an EMS system to the building in terms of energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort.\n\n\n\nI understand that Energy Plus has an EMS object, although I have to admit I do not know how developed it is.\n\n\n\nDo you think there would be space for one more item in the wishlist?\n\n\n\nIf not, I wonder if anyone in the community has some experience in using the EMS component. Specifically in adding it through the extra strings in Honeybee simulation component.\n\n\n\nThank you all in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 17, 2015 at 8:56pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "What about an EMS component?", "id": "topic_1289122"}
