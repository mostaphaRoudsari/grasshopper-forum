{"body": "\nChristian,\n\n\n\nI have finished putting together two new Ladybug components that will streamline the use of the method that you have posted here.\u00a0 The components are:\n\n\n\n**Ladybug_Surface View Analysis** - A component that calculates view factors from a point or plane to a set of surfaces.\u00a0 The component uses a ray-tracing method that increases with accuracy as you increase the viewResolution (I recommend using a value of 2 to ensure that your view factor error is below 1%).\u00a0 Because of the ray-tracing method, the component should be able to handle any surface geometry that you put into it. Importantly, if you input a point, the view factors will be calculated without a bias in direction but inputting a plane will calculate the view seen by a surface in the plane, which includes the directional bias induced by the direction the surface faces. This image gives you a sense of how the component works showing you the surface temperatures from EnergyPlus mapped onto the sphere of view:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/iRPFRg2AvJEDIk**T6J6AaRELMVyTWUjkOI1A2uWVxsCmZ-ajxPH4jyhE-hWm7bUx6ftzOWyKVw57DgqkaH3drvsQPQ0eR0q/RadiantTemperatureField.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/iRPFRg2AvJEDIk**T6J6AaRELMVyTWUjkOI1A2uWVxsCmZ-ajxPH4jyhE-hWm7bUx6ftzOWyKVw57DgqkaH3drvsQPQ0eR0q/RadiantTemperatureField.JPG)\n\n\n\n**Ladybug_Radiant Asymmetry Discomfort** - A component that calculates the percentage of people dissatisfied (PPD) from radiant asymmetry.\u00a0 It uses the formulas that Christian has posted on this discussion, which are also the formulas published in ASHRAE 55:\n\n[https://www.scribd.com/doc/194468127/Ashrae-Std-55-2010](https://www.scribd.com/doc/194468127/Ashrae-Std-55-2010)\n\nAnd in the CBE comfort tool:\n\n[http://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/](http://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/)\n\n[https://github.com/CenterForTheBuiltEnvironment/comfort_tool/blob/m...](https://github.com/CenterForTheBuiltEnvironment/comfort_tool/blob/master/static/js/local-discomfort.js#L11-L14)\n\nWith this component, you can convert the temperature difference across a plane:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/iRPFRg2AvJEVrFbw-4V5wocgJtx5FOtL-priTsuL9YIWlAiuWLI029fTpipxTi-9ew2ALNrCotzOOwEOD5hvt7ADWTXuwcJh/TempDiff.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/iRPFRg2AvJEVrFbw-4V5wocgJtx5FOtL-priTsuL9YIWlAiuWLI029fTpipxTi-9ew2ALNrCotzOOwEOD5hvt7ADWTXuwcJh/TempDiff.JPG)... to a percent of people dissatisfied (PPD) from radiant asymmetry:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/iRPFRg2AvJEzkQ4QAdW8IbfHpDsTKWrz*N4pzWRb7FmvJOqSi4N2YHDrM5CwPks27VgtGjl-KgYXNUwEWurXH39wMkbs12Yf/PPD.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/iRPFRg2AvJEzkQ4QAdW8IbfHpDsTKWrz*N4pzWRb7FmvJOqSi4N2YHDrM5CwPks27VgtGjl-KgYXNUwEWurXH39wMkbs12Yf/PPD.JPG)... and then to a temporal plot of radiant discomfort risk:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/iRPFRg2AvJHaQWXymfQi-LjLHF-Nn9BXhwR*wJAe0pBECxUxOuh2yswyPUNs-I4r3Z1uAvEJ8ZNBJWx0YvMQyy5U4v-w9rDI/RadAsymDiscomf.JPG\" width=\"717\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/iRPFRg2AvJHaQWXymfQi-LjLHF-Nn9BXhwR*wJAe0pBECxUxOuh2yswyPUNs-I4r3Z1uAvEJ8ZNBJWx0YvMQyy5U4v-w9rDI/RadAsymDiscomf.JPG)\n\n\n\nIf you sync with the github, you can find these components under the WIP section.\n\n\n\nHere you can find an example file that shows you how to estimate radiant asymmetry discomfort using these components and the results of an EnergyPlus simulation:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Radiant_Asymmetry_Discomfort&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1.0000000000000004&amp;offset=64.23627386566636,-8.784339845403167)\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any feedback, Christian.\u00a0 If you get the chance to ask Olesen the question about the wall asymmetry, please let us know.\n\nThanks again for all of the info that you have posted here.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 8, 2016 at 1:23pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1502799", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1503886"}
