{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\ni would like to ask you if it is possible to\u00a0recover the results of the zone operative temperature\u00a0(both values results\u00a0and plotting results)\u00a0in order to don\u00b4t run the simulation again, which takes hours.\n\nThis is my workflow:\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/y9G3WvU4wnScvEOfyB97XVuHbvlvzIq6w42m8knr01kmBWngiwZiUQJkIV8bdyjbylPTPJktLTuSI0yOX7Jn9h4R*z9-S5SY/1.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/y9G3WvU4wnScvEOfyB97XVuHbvlvzIq6w42m8knr01kmBWngiwZiUQJkIV8bdyjbylPTPJktLTuSI0yOX7Jn9h4R*z9-S5SY/1.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have tried to connect the resultFileAddress (in HB_Read EP surface result component)\u00a0with the address of the results i have obtained once i have run the simulation, but the output of resultValues from the \"Visualize microclimatemap\" is \"**NaN To NaN**\", so i guess i am doing something wrong.\n\nSomeone can help me?\n\nI don\u00b4t think/hope that run the simulation again is the only solution ;)\n\nPS In the HB_Microclimate Map Analysis component i left the writeResultFile input as default, so it is set to true.\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "July 27, 2016 at 08:21AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Recover Results \"NaN To NaN\"", "id": "topic_1571947"}
