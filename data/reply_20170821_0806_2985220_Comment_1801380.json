{"body": "Abraham,\nThe error should mean exactly what it says. You have connected inputs that have made desirable conditions that are beyond the boundaries of the psych Chart. Connecting high clo or metabolic rates can make extremely cold temperatures desirable according to the PMV model and it's perhaps easiest to see this in the online CBE tool:\nhttp://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu\n\nYou should also keep in mind that the PMV model has been shown to be a poor predictor of comfort at these higher close/met values since discomfort at these temperatures is typically driven by the temperature difference between extremities and the torso (rather than the \"full body\" discomfort that PMV estimates). Particularly when you have a clo value of 3, we're talking about the insulation equivalent of an Arctic Parka so I would take those results with a grain of salt.\n\nYou should be able to get those 3 polygons connecting up the inputs as you aHave there (I would just suggest lowing the closing of 3). Also, I am not sure what you are referring with the passive strategies. Could you elaborate?\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 21, 2017 at 08:06AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1801349", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1801380"}
