{"body": "\nGiuseppe,\n\nIt will be nice if you upload a file with your problem pointing out where the problem is. In this case also, what are the expected results and what are those that you get.\n\nI don't have access right now to GH but as I recall the results of the U don't show the influence of the air layers but they are definitely taken into account during the simulation. There is a component, don't remember which one, that you can ask for the U with those air layers.\n\nHope this is your \"problem\", meaning there is no problem.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "September 09, 2015 at 03:35AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1357076", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1357362"}
