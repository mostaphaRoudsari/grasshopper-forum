{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nFor a location for which a weather file is not available from any source, and paying for\u00a0proprietary services is not an option, is there a way to fabricate weather data?\n\n\n\nChris,\n\nCan Dragonfly help in this regard?\n\n\n\nWhat I have come up with in my search on this is Urban Weather Generator from MIT that generate hourly urban air temperature and humidity values for a location based on weather data for that city. But what I am interested in is rather a full fabricated weather file.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "January 27, 2017 at 3:30am", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "topic_1233405", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1679269"}
