{"body": "\nHi Burin, Decompose HBZOnes is exactly designed for what you are using it for. There were couple of issues here and there though.\n\n1. To make zone attributes component work faster the component creates a copy of the initial zone and then uses that for next iteration. In cases like your example you need to set recallHBHive_ to True so it updates every time. I think we will change the default to True to avoid confusion ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/282](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/282)).\n\n\n\n2. Once you are creating zone from surfaces you need to flatten the list so all the surfaces go in the same branch.\n\n\n\n3. You don't need to recreate HBSurfaces. When you do that you overwrite the construction that you'ver assigned. They are already HBSurfaces so just change what you need to change and put them back together. It is as easy as this.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8k2*97pl68yE05E9RY71utc6-SaHn4OPfcUHFJ2zVnosg1daT04dC5mbNsERCvsvwTtdYzJJkcB3i4GN-MQFkQDPII7BYxlA/DecomposeZone_II.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/8k2*97pl68yE05E9RY71utc6-SaHn4OPfcUHFJ2zVnosg1daT04dC5mbNsERCvsvwTtdYzJJkcB3i4GN-MQFkQDPII7BYxlA/DecomposeZone_II.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1224993", "name": "Decompose_HBZone_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 15, 2015 at 12:29pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1224499", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1224991"}
