{"body": "\nHi Gjergji,\n\n\n\nIf you can provide your GH script it will be easier for people to take a look and help.\n\n\n\nI am guessing that you are assessing the impact of multiple trees following Chris's example. If the geometry representing the trees is simple enough (most of the time flat surfaces will do) it should not put much stress on the simulation. I am not sure what happens with more complex shapes and the view factor calculations. You can try starting with a very coarse grid and move to more refined studies perhaps.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "September 21, 2016 at 09:35PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1602887", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1603912"}
