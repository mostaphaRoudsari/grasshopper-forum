{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI would like to get a better hang of OpenStudio so that I can make adjustments to a model generated with Honeybee. Would anyone have suggestions for best learning resources based on personal experience? I am willing to pay for these materials if need be.\n\n\n\nI am primarily interested in a pure Honeybee &gt; OpenStudio workflows - but I have also run into situations where I felt like it would have been beneficial to know SketchUp and to know how to generate an OpenStudio file with SketchUp.\n\n\n\nAny and all thoughts would be much appreciated!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ernst Bay", "created_at": "August 28, 2017 at 08:50AM", "created_by": "ErnstBay", "topic": "OpenStudio Learning Resources", "id": "topic_1805220"}
