{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nis it possible to insert (by an Honeybee tool) the \"ShadingProperty:Reflectance\" to associate with the \"Shading:Building:Detailed\" geometry? I would use this parameter in order to set all the reflectance\u00a0properties of the possible external shadings (louvres, fix shadings etc..).\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf i use the RADmat, does it take into account the Radiance material properties in the E+ calculation? If yes, where is the shading material in the .idf file?\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nNic\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "falko", "created_at": "December 21, 2016 at 3:52am", "created_by": "falko", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1526890", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1661126"}
