{"body": "\nAris,\n\nI apologize that this fell through the cracks for almost a year but I finally remembered to implement it:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/fe8fb38e97dd1551...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/fe8fb38e97dd1551f101e72b4ecbcc302966faab)\n\nThis is going to be much easier to explain to people now and I updated the description in the component as follows:\n\nThe units for shade desirability are degree-days, which are essentially the amount of time in days that sun is blocked by a given cell multiplied by the degrees above (or below) the _balanceTemperature during that time. \u00a0So, if a given square meter of _testShade has a shade desirability of 10 degree-days, this means that a shade in this location provides roughly 1 day of sun protection from conditions 10 degrees Celsius warmer than the balanceTemperature_ to 1 square meter of _testRegion.\n\n\n\nThanks again for suggesting this.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 07, 2017 at 10:45AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1605707", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810102"}
