{"body": "\nYes! This is broken for now. :| I worked on the issue one weekend and found a work around but it can bring some security issue so I left it open for now:([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/194#issuecommen...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/194#issuecomment-63257133)).\n\nMeanwhile you need to manually download the files from github (or use github app) and provide address to userobjects to folder to component using sourceDirectory input. We are aiming for a new release this week so I can't work on this issue right now but I will try to address the issue soon after the release. Sorry and thank you for your patience.\n\n- Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 18, 2015 at 7:08pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1206649", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1206671"}
