{"body": "\nHi Ding,\n\nYour explanation sounds convincing and i feel more comfortable with it.\n\nI checked the schedule file and i see that effectively, you have there the fraction of the light used for each hour. So that compensates somehow the lack of the Daylight class in E+. A difference of 3-4% is bearable. I checked also with my local EPW and i get the same range of difference.\n\nNo doubt the daylight simulation with Radiance/Daysim is more reliable than the E+, but just for you to know (maybe you do), E+ allowsup to 2 sensors in each thermal zone. It will be interesting to \"downgrade\" the daylight simulation to just one or two grid points (locates strategically in the space), instead the whole grid, and see how the results change. For calculation time in your model it won't make a difference, but if you have a more complicated model i will probably will select carefully the proper sensor location.\n\nI'm not sure what do you call Heat Waste, but light in E+ also represent a source of heat (internal heat gain, such as the equipment) that will affect the Heating/Cooling loads.\n\n\n\nGood luck,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 05, 2015 at 09:13AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280821", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280846"}
