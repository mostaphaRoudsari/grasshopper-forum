{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI'm checking the Example of Shade Benefit file you uploaded above. It runs fine. I updated all the components and there is an issue with the HB_EnergyShadeBenefit. It complains about (red component):\n\n1. Solution exception:Local variable 'legendFontSize' referenced before assignment.\n\nThen i connected the LB_LegendPar to see if it can solve the situation. Then i get (orange component):\n\n1. The calculation has been terminated by the user!\n\nFor now i pasted the \"old\" component and it is working, but ... just to let you know.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 17, 2014 at 12:26AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1192157", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1189495"}
