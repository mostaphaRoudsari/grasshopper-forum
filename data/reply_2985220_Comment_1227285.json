{"body": "\nHi Theodoros,\n\nNo way the windowTransmissivity refers to the properties of the glass/window. Those you get/give when you define the proper material.\n\nThe hint in the\u00a0AdaptComfRecipe says:\n\nwindowTransmissivity_: An optional decimal value between 0 and 1 that represents the transmissivity of windows around the person.\u00a0 This can also be a list of 8760 values between 0 and 1 that represents a list of hourly window transmissivties, in order to represent the effect of occupants pulling blinds over the windows, etc. Note that you should only set a value here if you are using this component for indoor analysis where the only means by which sunlight will hit an occupant is if it comes through a window.\u00a0 The default is set to 0.7, which is the trasmissivity of the default Honeybee glazing construction.\n\nI understand here that the intention is to combine the influence of shading devices as for the amount of sunlight that enters the space. What i see in the hint is that i can define this \"coefficient\" for each hour of the year. In this way is kind of Shading Coefficient for the window That's why i'm asking.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 19, 2015 at 3:46am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1227264", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1227285"}
