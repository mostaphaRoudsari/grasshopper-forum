{"body": "\nhello Guys,\n\nI need to simulate\u00a0\u00a0if the radiation relflected from a\u00a0high gloss fa\u00e7ade will affect the comfort of a person standing beside this fa\u00e7ade on the exterior side. I'm planning to use A EP simulation to get the mean Rad temperature from the reflective fa\u00e7ade and plug that to a Ladybug_Outdoor_Solar_Temperature_Adjustor. And from there plot with a UTCI from a LadyBug_Outdoor_comfort_Calculator.\n\n\n\nIS this the right way to go. Any suggestions\n\n\n\ncheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "February 25, 2015 at 8:09pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "Mean Rad Temperature how to get account for surface radiation from surroundings", "id": "topic_1231901"}
