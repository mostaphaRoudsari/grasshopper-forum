{"body": "\nDevang :\n\nI thought about that but I don't know T(in) before the simulation, so it would require to run the simulation twice and create a schedule of time when T(in) &gt; T(out) . But then again, this would change the simulation result and thus T(in).. so maybe after a few iteration you could consider that you result is quite good but it makes it quite complicated to run ..\n\n\n\nAbraham :\n\nI read the discussion, but it does not solve my problem..<br/>The problem is that the component allows you to specify a range for T(in) and T(out) separately but for instance if I want to use natural cooling, then I want to cool when :\n\nT(in) &gt; 24\u00b0C \u00a0IF T(out) &lt; T(in)\n\nFor instance, if T(in) = 25\u00b0C and T(out) = 26\u00b0C, I don't really want to open the windows, which is what this component does.\n\n\n\nAurelien\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aurelien Keller", "created_at": "January 30, 2017 at 02:15PM", "created_by": "AurelienKeller", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1681169", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1681089"}
