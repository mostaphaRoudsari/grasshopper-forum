{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for the response.\n\n\n\nOn the first point you are right, it is exactly what the component does. However, I was wondering if we could get a string output of the calculations with dominant orientation and wind speed per height. Unless there is one and I missed it in which case I'm sorry.\n\n\n\nOn the second point, thanks I did not know that! Will try it asap.\n\n\n\nFor the final point, and to sum up basically, you are right. I am asking for CFD simulations I am currently running. I think with a simple output the component is already useful as an input to CFD as it will provide an output the wind profile in different directions. So I must admit a personal interest in this.\n\n\n\nThanks again for your help!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 11, 2015 at 08:14PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1237563", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240844"}
