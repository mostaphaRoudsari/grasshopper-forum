{"body": "\nSorry it is still running here as well and can't open the file.\n\n\n\nI believe I'm concatenating to create their names, typical MassingOrientation_XX_LeftBuildingAngle_XX_RightBuildingAngle_XX if i'm not mistaken.\n\n\n\nThe component is close to the simulation component because it also assings the same name on the layer on which the result are baked.\n\n\n\nBtw, if you are running my definition I should warn you it will take around 4 hours. Haven't found a way to cancel fly component but the task manager will do (and actually you can still open the .csv in pollination after).\n\n\n\nI am guessing that by parallel you mean two different simulations. I haven't tried that yet. Wouldn't just adding another set of recorders connected to the second simulation output work? Not sure though can't check yet.\n\n\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 09:40PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447885", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448110"}
