{"body": "\nHi Ilya,\n\n\n\nThank you for the nice comment.\n\n\n\nLet's make sure we are comparing similar values together. First of all make sure that you are using the same weather file for both Ecotect and Ladybug.\n\n\n\nMoreover Ecotect's sky model is different from Ladybug's sky model ([http://naturalfrequency.com/wiki/sky-subdivision](http://naturalfrequency.com/wiki/sky-subdivision)). Ladybug uses Tregenza/Reinhart sky models and Radiance's gendaymtx which are both validated methods.\n\n\n\nFor what you are calculating it is easy to compare the values with the weather data. Check global Horizontal Radiation values from the weather file and compare them to your results of the simulation for a roof. They should be pretty close. The more you add to sky density the closer the values will be. Check the attached file for an example.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1105785", "name": "globalHorizontalRadiationComparison.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 24, 2014 at 3:31am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1105043", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1105783"}
