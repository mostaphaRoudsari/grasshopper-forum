{"body": "\nSo, I've discarded the methods above and replaced the SplitBuldingMass component with a number of native GH components. By doing so the workflow is more straight-forward (Geometry-&gt;HBSurface-&gt;HBSrfWGLZ-&gt;HBZones) and It should work better when the design gets more complicated.\n\nI've come across a new problem I that I haven't faced before though, the Decompose Based On Type outputs are strange... In PrintSceen1 the Solve Adjacencies component is previewed and it looks like everything is working as it should. But the Decompose component only show the roof and a couple of the walls (PrintScreen2)? What have I done wrong?\n\nI've also attached the GH model.\n\n\n\nThanks again for your help!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1237819", "name": "PrintScreen1.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1237820", "name": "PrintScreen2.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1237821", "name": "HBZones problem.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sverker Dahlblom", "created_at": "March 06, 2015 at 02:48AM", "created_by": "SverkerDahlblom", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1236262", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1237818"}
