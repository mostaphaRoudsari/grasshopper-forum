{"body": "\nHi! My understanding is that a parabola concentrate all the rays on focus point if the rays are parallel to axis(?). I tried to reverse engineer and find the axis from the geometry and use it to create the \u00a0vectors. It give a better result but it's not perfect. Have you tried to test it with an standard parabola shape?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1316774", "name": "raytracing_parabola_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 27, 2015 at 2:34pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1315902", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1316773"}
