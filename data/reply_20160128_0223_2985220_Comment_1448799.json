{"body": "\nI think you are wrong saying that the % difference between values is what is making the result more or les reliable. Take the result as is. -0.141 and -0.0988 is not even a 1% of the significance of the result. You are looking for PMV (or any other for that matter), you have to compare in relation to the possible values on this measuring scale and not in relation to the values obtained. At least not in the range of values you get. A difference of 1-2% can be acceptable, because of the reasons i mentioned before.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 28, 2016 at 02:23AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448582", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448799"}
