{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThank you for your quick response. Ideally I would like to separate each zone by rooms if possible, but I can settle for removing the walls and separating zones by floors for now.\u00a0\n\nI didn't know it was possible to import a gbXML file directly into Rhino/GH. I assume that is what you mean right? I will have to do some research on that. If it's possible to import a room based model in, then I will gladly take that approach instead; that seems much easier than working with the DWG. Also, HB and LB will be able to use the room data?\n\nI also tried using the import idf HB example file to import an idf file of my building, and I'm getting this error when I try running the energy simulation: \"Solution exception: 'str' object has no attribute 'name'. At first I thought it was because the model had no value in the \"str\" field before exporting the idf, but I double checked and it does. Any other suggestions? And if it's possible to bring the room based gbXML directly into Rhino/GH then ignore this question.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/C1Uy1o3oshpYAj7O3W59W3VGHdwhrMCm7dKK71w2VIAUTfNmvtVLlTAu2j5bjXubbCepIeE2x1YaTH7w-w-64kiSeYTELgvQ/20161115_102106.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/C1Uy1o3oshpYAj7O3W59W3VGHdwhrMCm7dKK71w2VIAUTfNmvtVLlTAu2j5bjXubbCepIeE2x1YaTH7w-w-64kiSeYTELgvQ/20161115_102106.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeremy Kong", "created_at": "November 15, 2016 at 11:32am", "created_by": "JeremyKong", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1639610", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1639973"}
