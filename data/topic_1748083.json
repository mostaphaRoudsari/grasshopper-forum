{"body": "\nHi Ladybug team,\n\nI ran into this problem where the MicroclimateMap component returns a 'terminated by user' error when trying to calculate UTCI for a day. I searched the forum and found that the problem has been around for some time. Has anyone found a solution to this?\n\nI attach the gh definition below and the E+ results in.csv file to save time as the simulation can take 20 mins.\n\n\n\nAnd a slightly off-topic question: is it possible to create another MicroclimateMap component that is fed surface temps and radiation data from honeybee and all the other parameters from Envi-met? This hybrid approach could help generate more spatially detailed results.\n\n\n\nAll the best\n\nAris\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1748081", "name": "courtyard_EPLUS_internalised.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1748082", "name": "in.csv"}], "created_by_name": "Aris V", "created_at": "May 9, 2017 at 1:57am", "created_by": "ArisVartholomaios", "topic": "MicroclimateMap termination error", "id": "topic_1748083"}
