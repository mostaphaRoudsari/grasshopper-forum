{"body": "\nHi Antonello,\n\n<br/>Thank you very much! This is exactly what i needed, now that the data is formatted the way in need it (both radiation and temp), i can start optimizing shapes with it.\n\n\n\n**(If you are interested what im going to do with this data: I want to directly relate radiation and the needed amount of generated engery through windows. So that i can find the perfect location of windows throughout the day, on a shape that has very high freedom of form. I want to see if the form freedom of 3d printing with concrete has potential to more efficiently use solar radiation in a passive way.)**\n\n\n\n**cyyo**\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "cyyo", "created_at": "December 02, 2015 at 05:25AM", "created_by": "cyyo", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1413192", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1413502"}
