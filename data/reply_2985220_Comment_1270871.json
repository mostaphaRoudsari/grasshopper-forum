{"body": "\nHi Mostapha\n\n\n\nthe point is outside.\n\n\n\nWell I noticed, that for HoneyBee radiance case, I also had the ground plane included in the simualtion. Without groundplane the result is 776 W/m2, which is almost the cumulative Sky value.\n\n\n\nOk, this leads me to another question:\n\nThe above calculations were done with a grid size of 3, resulting in a single test point on the exploring surface. When I decrease the grid size to 1, resulting in 16 test points and take an average of the values, the result is 464 W/m2 for the same HOY.\n\n\n\n-rpict\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1270873", "name": "Irradiance.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "rpict", "created_at": "April 23, 2015 at 1:55am", "created_by": "rpict", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1270015", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1270871"}
