{"body": "\nHi Amadeo\n\nI'm not an expert on this but from what I understand reflections on glass are very dependent on context. In your case the images out of Radiance has no context what so ever so it s normal that no reflection is displayed by the software. Perhaps you could model some context bldgs. as well as some interior geometry and compare the results. Also a more oblique POV will give\u00a0 a more pronounced\u00a0Fresnel effect therefore more reflections. From what I can see in your example image the glass unit seams to have quite amount of reflections, if your glare study is for an exterior POV then a mirror like material will give better results\n\nGood luck\n\nclaudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "April 1, 2015 at 7:09pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "parent_id": "topic_1254320", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1254533"}
