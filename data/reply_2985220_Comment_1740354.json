{"body": "\nHi Ji,\n\nWhy don't you connect directly the brep component to the HB_Mass2Zone? This works fine.\n\nThe boxes you create don't intersect between them. They have only a common face. I assume that this is what confuses the HB_IntersectMass.\n\nOf course, i assume each box will be an independent zone and you don't want to make combinations of boxes into 1 zone.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 26, 2017 at 10:56am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1740240", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1740354"}
