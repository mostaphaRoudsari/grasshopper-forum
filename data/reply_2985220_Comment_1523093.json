{"body": "\nHi Antoine,\n\n\n\nThank you for checking the results and opening the discussion.\n\n\n\nI can't recreate the difference between EnergyPlus run and EnergyPlus through Honeybee. Can you share idf file(s) or result file(s). Did you check the csv files? Are the values shifted inside the files? I'm trying to understand if it is an error in the results parser or the file itself.\n\n\n\nBack to the second question we don't add frames to Windows and leave the fields empty in EnrgyPlus. We currently don't support Frame and Dividers in Honeybee but it can be provided if there is enough need to use it. Back to the difference are you using the same Glass properties in IES and EnergyPlus? With and without the frame the rate should stay the same however the total value will be different.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 4, 2016 at 8:42pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1522191", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1523093"}
