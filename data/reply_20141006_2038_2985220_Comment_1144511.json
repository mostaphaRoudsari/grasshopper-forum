{"body": "\nHi Nate,\n\nI cannot generate as much as difference as you have in your image. I can still see a difference though which is as expected.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/l4W8jVdh3X9ZZA6NvHweDk10wQTRR2XQ-04IR2RkDkqN9WwGfcqXCSggv-MPGJHQcx1vjXZBhfp27D1AHmRWHMIb2eWtdRWu/results_12pm_Top.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/l4W8jVdh3X9ZZA6NvHweDk10wQTRR2XQ-04IR2RkDkqN9WwGfcqXCSggv-MPGJHQcx1vjXZBhfp27D1AHmRWHMIb2eWtdRWu/results_12pm_Top.png)\n\nIt is mainly because the sky is pretty clear at the hour that you are testing and as you have probably seen in the paper Daysim methodology has quite a bit of simplification for the direct lights. If you try it for another hour with less direct light you will see that the results will closely match (e.g. 10 am the same day)\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/l4W8jVdh3X-UB2rqF8K2wHYHmlEdrPBYvvARMwQUH6n1S8LMi5uY-N7g*c78yn23lTF06zSGA2FhX--0dUj9S7QfFDwUQo8A/results_10am_Top.png?width=680\" width=\"680\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/l4W8jVdh3X-UB2rqF8K2wHYHmlEdrPBYvvARMwQUH6n1S8LMi5uY-N7g*c78yn23lTF06zSGA2FhX--0dUj9S7QfFDwUQo8A/results_10am_Top.png)\n\nYou are probably thinking that how can you trust the results from Daysim then! Well, if you check one of the annual measures, for instance check the area that has illuminance &gt; 500 lux, you will see the results will be pretty close.\n\n\n\nSaying this, I should also add that there are newer methodologies (3-5 Phase methods) that are trying to address this issue. Implementing them to Honeybee will open up a new set of possibilities.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 06, 2014 at 08:38PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1143836", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1144511"}
