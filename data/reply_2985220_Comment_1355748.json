{"body": "\nDaniel,\n\nI believe that EnergyPlus requires a minimum of 1 warmup day and, if the warmup conditions do not converge to a stable value in the warmup period, E+ gives you a severe error to tell you that you simulation is probably wrong. \u00a0That is why we write the default values in if you put in warmup days that are &lt;= 0.\n\nI haven't checked the E+ Input/Output reference enough to know if there is a way to plug in custom conditions for the warmup period:\n\n[http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/)\n\nIf you find something in there that sounds like it will do what you want, let us know and I can try to implement it in Honeybee.\n\nI am not sure which attachment you are referring to in your most recent post.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 6, 2015 at 11:10am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1349415", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1355748"}
