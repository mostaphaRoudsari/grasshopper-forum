{"body": "\nHi Oussennan,\n\nCan you explain what are you exactly trying to do? You can just use createHBSrfs\u00a0component and assign glass material to the surfaces.\n\nNevertheless if you added the glazing to the surface then you can use Run_Daylight Analysis and run the analysis for your geometry.\n\nIf you upload an example it will be much easier to help.\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 16, 2014 at 9:59pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1045415", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1045841"}
