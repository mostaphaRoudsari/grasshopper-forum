{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nYes. I could easily implement that inside the component. But I am concerned about adding good two inputs for colors. One for frequencies and the other for average velocities. The advantage of doing this outside the component is that one can also color the Title Text (The text Below WindRose) if one wants to. If you and Mostapha are good with adding two more inputs then I will implement it.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "January 28, 2017 at 1:10pm", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1680114", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1679957"}
