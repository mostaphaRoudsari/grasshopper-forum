{"body": "\nHi Aurelien,\n\n\n\nI would customize the occupancy schedule.\n\nCreate a new schedule with the values of the occupancy file with a function that substitute the values=0 (when there is no occupancy) for the amount that you need. You can always calculate this value by inputting a fraction of the ventilation per area or per person, as suits you.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3oOh0daNY6Nib5L6TXS0Br0A6Bc-qQoY1G-R-ziRzfRxoDoKw8jzpHhsFt7rhr9ZLbhkpuzxi3LwR0yglG2D4OM9c704i7VZ/schedule.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3oOh0daNY6Nib5L6TXS0Br0A6Bc-qQoY1G-R-ziRzfRxoDoKw8jzpHhsFt7rhr9ZLbhkpuzxi3LwR0yglG2D4OM9c704i7VZ/schedule.PNG)\n\nHope it helps\n\n\n\nJulia\n\n\n\nEdit: keep in mind that the simulation will calculate the ventilation per area/person multiplied by the number of the new schedule (approx to explain it in a simple way, hope Mostapha doesn't kill me for saying that), so be very careful with the numbers that you put there\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1675579", "name": "customized schedule.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Julia T", "created_at": "January 20, 2017 at 09:23AM", "created_by": "JuliaT", "parent_id": "topic_1675648", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1675577"}
