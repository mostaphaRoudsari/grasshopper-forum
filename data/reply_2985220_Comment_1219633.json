{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\n\nI attach two images that demonstrate the problem:\n\n**1) _TerrainType input:** The integer that I input doesn t correspond to the description of the input. I input 1 it is set to \"country\". While in the description it says \"suburban\". That s the same for value 0 2 and 3. They give different outputs of what is in the description.\n\n\n\n**2) epwTerrain:** Whatever the value there is either no output in the readMe! or no output at all.\n\n\n\nNot sure if its the readMe! output problem or the values have been shuffled.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDimitris\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1219635", "name": "Wind_Img_1.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1219636", "name": "Wind_Img_2.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "February 6, 2015 at 7:56am", "created_by": "doompop", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1219286", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1219633"}
