{"body": "\nHi Lenald,\n\nYour assumptions in the first paragraph is correct.\n\nAbout the second paragraph it's about the solid angle and converting the values from\u00a0kWh/m2.str to\u00a0kWh/m2 (which is also related to size of the patches). Each row has a different value for solid angle. For Reinhart sky the values are this list for each row: [0.00921483254, 0.00612971396, 0.0121875626, 0.00905126163, 0.0119026242, 0.00974295956, 0.011436609, 0.00974713106, 0.0108025291, 0.0117312774, 0.0125224872, 0.0105335058, 0.0109255262, 0.0111894547, 0.0113221971]\n\nOnce the original values are multiplied by solid angles the ones with lower conversion numbers are creating the bounds and since in diffuse sky the values are so close you can see the difference. If you change the conversion list with all 1's you will see the image that I uploaded before which has no bounds. Maybe I should visualize the skies with\u00a0kWh/m2.str to avoid this issue.\n\nI think I should also reply to Ian on the email. They know much more than me how to calculate these angles and conversions. I'm just keeping it for a time spot that I can follow up on the emails.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 6, 2015 at 11:51pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1199325", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1200050"}
