{"body": "\nMostapha, Chris and all,\n\nHappy ladybug+honeybee anniversary. Thank you all for this great effort, happy to know about using VR\u00a0connection with LB+HB. \u00a0I'm very lucky to be a part of this motivating &amp; inspiring forum, I learnt a lot from you and you are motivating me to work harder\u00a0to follow the Lb+Hb updates. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nfor my small wish list :) \u00a0\u00a0\n\n- I wish that some of the simulations take less time, especially radiation analysis &amp; comfort shade benefit\u00a0evaluator, as I tried many v.good PCs to run them but it was difficult and the building was too simple to have all that time. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n- for large scale &amp; high rise buildings, I wish that we can have a simpler way to define them in HB, as I should build every zone as surfaces \" walls, floors, ceiling \" so I can have a thermal zone and get my results without errors.\u00a0I know that's the right way to define the zone but it takes time, especially in the final performance evaluation of the building with all of its details. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n- Recently, I was working on a large scale building consists of 4 stories with different design plans, but fortunately, I had a building block to copy and mirror and I found the Hbmirror\u00a0&amp; Hbmove\u00a0very useful. I used it to move and mirror that block with many thermal zones which are moved with its names &amp; I had some errors,\u00a0I'm not sure that I used it in the right way. But I wish that there's a tool can help me copy or mirror thermal zones with its properties to make the process of defining the building's zones easier. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nwish you all success, happiness &amp; the best,\n\nMona \u00a0\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "February 07, 2017 at 06:21PM", "created_by": "monarezk", "parent_id": "topic_1677014", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1687223"}
