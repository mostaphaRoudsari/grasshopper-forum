{"body": "\nThanks Chris,\n\nThis is clear now. I think the input name _prevailingOutdoorTemp is a bit misleading in the sense that the hint recommends to plug the DryBulb from the EPW. I believe there is no other possible input here, right (the prevOutTemp is not provided elsewhere).\n\nCan you point me where in the component's code you calculate this average/mean?\n\nthank you again!!\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "September 3, 2016 at 3:01pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1592895", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1593178"}
