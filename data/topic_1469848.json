{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am running an energy simulation with honeybee and kept getting and error about \"EPFenSurface\u00a0object has no attribute blindmaterial\" when running the runEnergySimulation component. It pointed me to line 1536 of the script where it is looking for shading devices. As my model had no shading devices I just 'commented' the lines and it run (see below)\n\nBut althought it run, it did not output any of the glazing surfaces... it reported:\n\n\"unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'str' and 'lidt'\n\nFailed to write p_north_Srf_1_glz_0 to idf file\"\n\n\n\nAny ideas why this is happening?\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\nGustavo\n\n\n\n\n\n<img/>\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Gustavo B", "created_at": "February 23, 2016 at 9:04am", "created_by": "GustavoB", "topic": "error on energy simulation: object has no attribute blindmaterial", "id": "topic_1469848"}
