{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI have a couple of questions regarding your recommendations here above.\n\n1. windowTransmissivity: Can i assume that if i give a value (for instance 0.8) it means that the blinds are covering 80% of the window? This is what i understand from the hing in the input, but want to be sure.\n\n2. The HB_Zones coming out from the EPWindowShades is connected to the runEnergySimulation. The HBZones connected to the IndoorViewFactor come from each individual zone with outdoors facades. Then the output coming from EPWindowShades is also connected here. Are not the shades taking into account twice in this way? Once for the EP simulation and once more for the comfort recipe? I find this a bit confusing ... Just want to understand the logic of the process and calculations.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 18, 2015 at 11:23PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1227086", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1227174"}
