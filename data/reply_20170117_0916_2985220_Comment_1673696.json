{"body": "\nHi Boris,\n\n\n\nFirst of all, great tool!!! very interesting.\n\n\n\nI would like to ask something. I didn't have the opportunity to test the tool yet, so sorry if it's stupid.\n\n\n\nIs there any way to create the mesh for the solar rights under the condition of the surroundings getting just 1h of sunlight?\n\n\n\nI am thinking on a very restricted area, so how to get the minimum sun rights without reducing too much the available volume for your development.\n\nI get that it can be tested just for 12:00 as the most vertical sun position, but sometimes the urban morphology is quite tricky and another hour may be better for the solar access.\n\n\n\nJulia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julia T", "created_at": "January 17, 2017 at 09:16AM", "created_by": "JuliaT", "parent_id": "topic_1351457", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1673696"}
