{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\n\n\nThe location and timezone are correct. However, you may be on to something. The data that I was given (the direct, diffuse data shown above) is not tied to a specific location - it is arbitrary solar data for a theoretical location. I have simply selected a location that is applicable to my problem.\u00a0\n\nWith your comment in mind, looking at the sky generated by my replacement data almost seems as if time has been \"phase shifted\" which has caused the sky patches to move and reflect the asymmetry that we see.\n\nSo perhpas my data is not properly representing the sunrise / sunset of my location which causes the \"weirdness.\"\n\nWhat do you think?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mike Johnson", "created_at": "March 16, 2017 at 11:40AM", "created_by": "MikeJohnson", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714032", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714031"}
