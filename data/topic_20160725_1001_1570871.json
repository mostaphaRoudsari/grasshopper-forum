{"body": "\nHello everybody, I am quite new to energyplus and I decided to try it with for a study I am doing for a pedestrian bridge.\n\nI prepared the results and in first pace they made sense to me but looking at the air flows per area I realised there is something wrong, It look like energy plus has trouble with air wall as external wall as showed in the picture.\n\nI am not too sure how to set \u00a0natural ventilation as the windows in this example are closed and the air is coming only from the \"holes\" where the stairs are.\n\nDoes anybody has any idea? I attach the file for reference.\n\nThanks\n\nAmedeo\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1570869", "name": "elevetated pedestrian passage.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1570870", "name": "Picture13.png"}], "created_by_name": "amedeo scofone", "created_at": "July 25, 2016 at 10:01AM", "created_by": "amedeoscofone", "topic": "Natural ventilation of an open structure", "id": "topic_1570871"}
