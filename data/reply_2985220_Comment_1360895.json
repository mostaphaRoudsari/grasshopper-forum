{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nI can see a workflow in which we have 4 components that each perform one of the 4 key types of transforms (translation, rotation, reflection and scale) and I can see how this might make things a bit easier on our end rather than a single \"re-read geometry\" component.\n\nHowever, I am not sure if the way that you are proposing it would really solve this issue that Theodore and I are bringing up. \u00a0This is mainly that we don't want to simply take a HBZone and transform it (which we can do before creating the HBZone anyway) but that we want to take an existing HBzone and both transform it and turn it into a completely new zone with a new HBID. \u00a0This way, we can take both the non-transformed zone that - let's say - represents one floor of a building and the transformed zone representing another floor, run them both through solve adjacencies, and plug them into the Run Simulation component to be run as one model.\n\nSo, regardless of our implementation method (be it with 1 component or 4), we would need a function that copies all of the properties of a zone and copies all of the surfaces and child surfaces to create a new transformed zone. \u00a0Correct me if I am wrong but this is what you are describing as causing a big headache. \u00a0If so, leave it to me to investigate how to do this and just met me know if you have a preference for having one \"re-read geometry\" component or one component for each of the 4 major types of transforms.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 13, 2015 at 3:25pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1359669", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1360895"}
