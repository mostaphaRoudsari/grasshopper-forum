{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for your response. It is good to know I'm not the only one seeing this. I realize it is a Rhino thing mostly. To be honest, as a novice in Rhino, I do not understand how exactly the normals are assigned. Since most of my surfaces are extrusions from curves (aka the floor plan) I wonder if the normals of the curves should be set prior to creating the surfaces. I also am not sure if the normals are reassigned when you modify surfaces (trim, split, cut, merge, etc.).\n\n\n\nI have no problem at all with time matters to be honest. At least in serious models I would prefer to have things set up correctly. So I would welcome and test the approach you are describing.\n\n\n\nI do wonder however. Is this really an important issue though? I mean, does it compromise the Energy Simulation results seen as it is not a severe error for EP but just a few hundred warnings (simulation runs and finishes)? Only asking because I'd like to be sure I can trust my model right now.\n\n\n\nAs for the model itself, I am not in the work pc today. I will upload a few adjacent zones that reproduce the warnings tomorrow when I'll be back at it.\n\n\n\nP.S.: Ignore my adjacent surfaces comment. Took me a while to read Mostapha's comment with clear mind and yes I did go back to the videos to settle it :)\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 02, 2015 at 07:10PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1278966", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279214"}
