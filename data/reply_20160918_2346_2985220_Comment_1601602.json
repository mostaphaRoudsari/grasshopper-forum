{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nthank you for the reply. Well of course I know about the possibility to read the characteristic of the Radiance material but I mean in the case we don't apply any Radiance material. So the question is what is the reflectance of the default materials. I say this also because I get an error when I use the \u00a0component Get from radiance library. So I thought I get this error because the default materials are not Radiance materials properly defined.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/RBh5pTSdbmuSxPvK3tL4tima6QrbmkQHU6bM1Rd-vqPJly0UTYh2-RWsy6Yc4HMB9zgdLz4kFrQfXX2k6ikmNJv0WJUTj6zp/Untitled1.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/RBh5pTSdbmuSxPvK3tL4tima6QrbmkQHU6bM1Rd-vqPJly0UTYh2-RWsy6Yc4HMB9zgdLz4kFrQfXX2k6ikmNJv0WJUTj6zp/Untitled1.jpg)\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "September 18, 2016 at 11:46PM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "topic_1600208", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1601602"}
