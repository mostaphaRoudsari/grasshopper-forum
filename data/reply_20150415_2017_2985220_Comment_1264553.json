{"body": "\nPatrick --\n\nI suspect the culprit is some surface normal issues.\u00a0Look at the error file generated by E+ to see if the window or wall\u00a0geometry are facing each other (not desirable) and not outwards as they should be (you can also check the orientation in grasshopper using Vector Display). \u00a0You will need to flip their orientation before E+ is able to treat these surfaces as proper windows/walls. Once these surfaces are oriented outwards you should see changes in energy use as E+ will be able to recognize the window\u00a0geometry.\n\n--J\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "JPE", "created_at": "April 15, 2015 at 08:17PM", "created_by": "JPE", "parent_id": "topic_1263296", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1264553"}
