{"body": "\nhi everybody\n\nI'm optimizing Daylight Autonomy and PMV comfort and my parameters are angle and the width of louvers. At some months like December,January,February it doesn't show any results for optimization and it doesn't show any red cubes at the screen . I don't know where the problem is. Is it possible that octopus doesn't show anything for maximizing DA and PMV comfort?\n\nCan anyone help me? I'll appreciate it\n\ntnx[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-d4odOMqXTxDv75uJoHa6xqeIXwkVUXyLqykXyJiGYifu0isFx*V*zMpXi0YYgnwK1OfK*Ov5p0SZKRKA3y3D4SYSn53Rfm5/photo_20170727_235543.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-d4odOMqXTxDv75uJoHa6xqeIXwkVUXyLqykXyJiGYifu0isFx*V*zMpXi0YYgnwK1OfK*Ov5p0SZKRKA3y3D4SYSn53Rfm5/photo_20170727_235543.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1814318", "name": "photo_2017-07-27_23-55-43.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "leila pasandi", "created_at": "September 16, 2017 at 08:20AM", "created_by": "leilapasandi", "topic": "optimization problem", "id": "topic_1814319"}
