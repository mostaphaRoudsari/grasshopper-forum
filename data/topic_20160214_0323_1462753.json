{"body": "\nA bit off topic.\n\n\n\nI'm in the midst of a pedestrian comfort study and I'm currently analyzing wind velocities on 12 orientations. To do that I need an average velocity over the year for each of the orientations (0, 30, 60, ..).\n\n\n\nI use a simple definition with native components to extract this information from the epw file. However, I run into some 'trouble'.\n\n\n\nThere seem to be a lot of 0 values in the wind velocities. Most of these 0 values seem to be associated with the 0 direction (north direction is common in this weather file, i.e. Singapore, but I doubt it is so many 0s).\n\n\n\nI then proceeded to cull all the hours with 0 wind velocity and did the averaging over all the remaining hours (around 7100 for this weather file). However, I still get a bit of odd results that don't coincide with other data I have for the area. For example, average wind velocity in the north seems to be 1.12m/s while officially Singapore reports 2.1m/s. More discrepancies arise in the frequencies of the wind directions (the hours of each direction per year divided by total hours) from publically available data.\n\n\n\nAnyways, I don't want to tire you with so many specifics. The question to the forum is if anyone has used .epw files to collect wind data before and if we believe they are dependable for such calculations? If not, do you have any idea on where I could find open wind data of good quality?\n\n\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\nP.S.: Will be adding the definition once I'm in the office, even though it is quite straightforward.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 03:23AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Question about the quality of wind data within DOE epw files", "id": "topic_1462753"}
