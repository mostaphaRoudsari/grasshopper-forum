{"body": "\nRegarding the attached image, there are two overlapping surfaces. When creating a usual window (AddHBGlz/byRatio) the surfaces don't oberlap. Will this cause problems or falsify the results?\n\nIf not, I thought about two concepts.\n\n\n\n**Concept1:** Building the two windows separatly with **WindowShadeGenerator**, put it in the Mass2Zones component, solve adjacencies and put it in the E+ Simulation component.\n\nProblem: when I set **writeIDF** to true it says **'EPZone' object has no attribute 'cenPt'**?\n\n\n\n**Concept2** is about the **WindowShadeGenerator**. When you have Electrochromic Glazing, the **shadeBreps** output is empty, but what about the **windowBreps**. With ECs, is this output just the base geometry brep or is it the current shading state and does it contain any shade material data?\n\nThe thought behind this is, if you have the data when and which shading state (geometry+material) is active, you can use it as child surface in an AddHBGlz component and tell E+ when and which shading material is active (hourly).\n\n\n\nDoes this make any sense, can E+ even handle this?\n\nJakob\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jakob Schmidt", "created_at": "April 07, 2016 at 06:30AM", "created_by": "JakobSchmidt", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1501190", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1502790"}
