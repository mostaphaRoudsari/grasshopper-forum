{"body": "\nHi all.\n\nI just want to know if it is possible to run parametric energy simulation as parametric daylight analysis in tutorials? since i work on multi-objective optimization, i think it's better first run all possible solutions and then use them for optimization. any idea in this case can be so helpful.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mahr", "created_at": "December 8, 2015 at 1:47pm", "created_by": "mahr", "topic": "possibility of parametric energy simulation!", "id": "topic_1417543"}
