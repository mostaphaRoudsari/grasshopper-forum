{"body": "\nHi Nate and Chris,\n\nThis is an interesting discussion. I will check the files after work today. Keep in mind that Daysim is using a simplified method (both for sky and ray-tracing) to minimize the analysis time. Naturally it will always give you different and less accurate results than using Radiance for each hour. Look for this paper online:\u00a0Bourgeois D, Reinhart CF, Ward G, \u201cA Standard Daylight Coefficient Model for Dynamic Daylighting Simulations\u201d Building Research &amp; Information 36:1 pp. 68 \u2013 82, 2008.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 6, 2014 at 7:54am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1142337", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1143836"}
