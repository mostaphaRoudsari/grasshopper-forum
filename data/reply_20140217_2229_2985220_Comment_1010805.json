{"body": "\nHi Won Hee Ko,\n\nAs far as I can see you are using an old gencumsky component (VER 0.0.35) with the new Ladybug version (VER 0.0.54). That's why it gives you this error. Remove the old component and use the new one and it should be all fine.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: Where did you find the component from the old version? Hopefully not from the new release or the example files?\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 17, 2014 at 10:29PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1010878", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1010805"}
