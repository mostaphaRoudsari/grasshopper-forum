{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nI've enjoyed experimenting with these new tools and it seems to open up some interesting new workflows. One question I have, related to the earlier discussions, is to do with the insertion of elements created in Window:\n\n\n\nIn Therm, when you insert a Window component you have the option to orient it 'up', 'down', 'left or 'right' which allows you to use the glazing systems in a range of different scenarios. The grasshopper component only seems to allow you insert the elements in the 'up' orientation, with some planar rotation.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to replicate this insertion functionality within grasshopper? At the moment I cant see how you would model the top of a window frame without manipulating the window geometry natively in Therm after export.\n\n\n\nMany thanks\n\nMike\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mike", "created_at": "March 21, 2016 at 07:43AM", "created_by": "Mike185", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489056", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489482"}
