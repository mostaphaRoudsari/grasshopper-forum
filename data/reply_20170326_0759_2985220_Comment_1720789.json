{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for getting back to me! I am going to have a look into the Dragonfly example as it seems like a good place to start.\n\n\n\nNow that UWG has come up, it reminds me of the first option I was looking into for this project... I was originally going to use UMI ([http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/](http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/))\u00a0to evaluate UHI and to quantify building energy demand in different scenarios. It seems that the inter-functionality of UMI-UWG is no longer available though.\n\n\n\nDeclan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Declan Fay", "created_at": "March 26, 2017 at 07:59AM", "created_by": "DeclanFay", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1720875", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1720789"}
