{"body": "\nThank you very much for the detailed response djordje, you have answered all questions spot on.\n\nWhat I am now interested in is to show the TOF of all of my panels that are tessellated tangentially as in the .gh-file below. However, it takes a very long time to generate this calculation, even four about five panels or so, while I have about 1600 on the hyperbolic paraboloid. You once told me in another discussion that the **TOF component** did less calculations than the **PV Surface component** and would therefore be faster. However, it seems to go even slower when you have multiple surfaces.\n\nSo what I would like to know is how to have an idea of which PV panels would be worth of keeping on the hyperbolic paraboloid. For instance, to visually represent the panels with a TOF of &gt;90%, &gt;80%, &gt;70% and so on, without too long calculation time.\n\n(You will have to zoom out quite a bit to see the surfaces. The TOF component is in the red group and there is some part of the code that is irrelevant for this question, but it's quite clear.)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1567924", "name": "PRINGLE_PV TOF Analysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Erik Pelicaen", "created_at": "July 18, 2016 at 11:58AM", "created_by": "ErikPelicaen", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1567882", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1567922"}
