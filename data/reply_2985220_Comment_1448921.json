{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks. I was aware of the update :-)\n\nAs for taking the HB_VSC out i won't do it. When Mostapha just released it we did\u00a0 some intensive testing and found good agreement with the standards. See [this](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/vertical-sky-component-great-job?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A812013&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987) and [this](http://www.waterslade.org/main.htm) (right now seemd to be a broken link but hopefully not). I believe the answer for my original question is that is not correct to use SVF for VSC and visceversa. They are close but not fully (see that VSC takes into account 2 sky conditions, uniform CIE and cloudy while SVF is clean of that).\n\nBTW in your example i also added the LB_shadingMask and the agreement with the LB_shadingMaskII is completely equal (43.13% vs 43.04%).\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 11:58pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1377260", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448921"}
