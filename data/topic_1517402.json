{"body": "\nHi All,\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe attached GH file is designed to calculate the area of the working plane with a direct view of the sky. It names the room being assessed and culls the mesh to values above a defined threshold before displaying this in Rhino.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, it only works for one reference plane / room at a time. I've tried a bunch of things but am getting nowhere fast. When I select 3no. floorplates for the Test Surface brep, GH reports that the reColourMesh stage fails and is reporting the following: '1. length of the results [=288] is not equal to the number of mesh faces [=864]''. However, I can see that the .pts and .res files both have 864 values each. (288 values is the number for a single room)\n\n\n\nI would appreciate help on adapting it to do the following:\u00a0\n\nI would really appreciate any help from you all.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMany thanks\n\n\n\nNick\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1517400", "name": "View of Sky_160427.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1517401", "name": "3roommodel.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Nick Devlin", "created_at": "April 27, 2016 at 6:11am", "created_by": "NickDevlin", "topic": "Multi grid analysis", "id": "topic_1517402"}
