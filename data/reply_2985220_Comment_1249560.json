{"body": "\nRafat,\n\n\n\nI apologize for responding so late. \u00a0I have been so busy over the past week with my thesis.\n\n\n\nI think that your best bet with the ventilation will be to use the SetEPAirflow component and make a custom ventilation object (Option 2 on the NautralVentilation Type). \u00a0With this custom object, you can really take control over all of the inputs using the area of the net, the height of it, etc. \u00a0You probably want to drop down both the wind discharge coefficient and the stack discharge coefficient to account for the fact that the netting will create additional friction and slow down the air slightly. \u00a0Also, you probably want to use two\u00a0SetEPAirflow components in tandem and set the angle of the two ventilation objects to be opposite one another (to account for wind-driven cross flow). \u00a0Your final set of components should look something like this:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/HQSy6kXC6MpeHmK-x3pLlX5xeYoX*2iaxVIOm4Zogoypo0UGQQXE*W*xSLwekunjbtbgFOXuab74Dbx07QIfv*8wCivUDghq/NatVentForNet.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/HQSy6kXC6MpeHmK-x3pLlX5xeYoX*2iaxVIOm4Zogoypo0UGQQXE*W*xSLwekunjbtbgFOXuab74Dbx07QIfv*8wCivUDghq/NatVentForNet.PNG)\n\n\n\nTo clarify mostapha's comment on constructions and radiance materials, here is an image on how to assign them:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/HQSy6kXC6MqkJSCdfTgocVtZ78l0AvRcMY1-lY1eJ0nyd-ywpZqPT*PHRTPwmfI-p2WXhWm6Dfshjaer5kWEWFyjxB9urnQV/CreatingFilmMaterial.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/HQSy6kXC6MqkJSCdfTgocVtZ78l0AvRcMY1-lY1eJ0nyd-ywpZqPT*PHRTPwmfI-p2WXhWm6Dfshjaer5kWEWFyjxB9urnQV/CreatingFilmMaterial.PNG)\n\nI made some guesses about what the reflectance of your film is.\n\nYou can find more info on constructions in this video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeoXlQyPxg&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeoXlQyPxg&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=18)\n\n\n\nAnd more on radiance materials here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4MA82_CPPA&amp;list=PLkjfDmSc5OryX...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4MA82_CPPA&amp;list=PLkjfDmSc5OryXkWSt57ltJFU4qXD5ss1v&amp;index=1)\n\n\n\nAlso, if you want to get really deep into PAR, you will probably have to find some of your own ways of accounting for the changing color of sunlight at different angles (just the lux and radiation values won't get you accurate results in moles of photons). \u00a0You might want to check out the Ladybug_Colored Sky Visualizer to get a better sense of sky color with changing sun altitudes.\n\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 24, 2015 at 3:49pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1247218", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1249560"}
