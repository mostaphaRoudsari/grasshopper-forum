{"body": "\nHi Yafim\n\n\n\nYep geometry is now all there.\n\n\n\nSo I think the issue is that that you are decomposing your zones to create your glazed surfaces. This is causing a couple of problems.\n\n\n\nOne of the issues is that the stair zone surfaces adjacent to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th zone vertical surfaces with windows are failing as the stair surfaces are looking for glazed child surfaces. \u00a0You can split out your surfaces and then solve adjacencies to overcomes this so that surfaces with windows are not adjacent. You can of course split these out in the geometry beforehand. I'm not sure if this is a recurring problem as I have not noticed it before, perhaps Chris or Mostapha can comment.\n\n\n\nI've also a feeling that as you have split your zones the zone centre point is being thrown out so if you rebuild the zones afterwards this should overcome the issue.\n\n\n\nApologies as I have updated the file to new HB but I don't think this was causing the problem.\n\n\n\nI'd take notice of the report output as you have a number of warnings coming out of that file.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nDuncan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "May 24, 2016 at 06:32AM", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535681", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535855"}
