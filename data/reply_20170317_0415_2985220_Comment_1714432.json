{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you for your clarifications and your time on this.<br/><br/>\n\nThe .csv option also seemed a good idea for me, but the file is quite heavy (1GB roughly), which Grasshopper was not capable of handling either. At least not with reasonable computing times.\n\n\n\nI had not thought of the following option you suggest, which is a clever solution for the problem. This is definitely what I was looking for!\n\n**I'll also say that, if you are only interested in the results at a single hour, you can always take the radiant temperature and air temperature maps from the mircolimate analysis and plug them into the Outdoor Comfort Calculator component along with your CFD values for wind speed. \u00a0This will give you comfort values at each point for the hour in question.**\n\n\n\nCongratulations for Butterfly!\n\n\n\nRafael\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rafael A.", "created_at": "March 17, 2017 at 04:15AM", "created_by": "RafaelA", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1712698", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714432"}
