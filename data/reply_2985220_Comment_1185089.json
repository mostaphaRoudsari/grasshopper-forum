{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nI was just expecting the DOY/HOY component to work with Series in combination with the \"Honeybee_Read Hourly Results from Annual Daylight Study\" to give results for periods of time or day etc. (attached)\n\nI am probably missing the obvious here but I can t figure out how to use the \"Honeybee_Read All the Hourly Results from Annual Daylight Study\"\u00a0and select the hours that you need.\"\n\nAny chance to provide an example here?
