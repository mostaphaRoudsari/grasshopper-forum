{"body": "\nCongratulations team for the awesome work done so far. We appreciate this.\n\nHowever, I believe the IDF export shouldn't be phased out because of limitless modeling capabilities that can be accessed through ONLY IDF editor. By doing this we are completely incapacitating the simulation Path which helps immensely to intermediate and advance users. I completely sync with the OSM capabilities too. So I would be glad to see both the options added and developed in future releases.\n\nThanks in advance.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Javed Iqbal", "created_at": "August 25, 2016 at 09:41PM", "created_by": "JavedIqbal", "parent_id": "topic_1580355", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1588775"}
