{"body": "\nHi Claudia,\n\n\n\nWhen you're using addHBGlz component a window should have the same normal direction as the wall (which Reinhardt mentioned) and also all the corners of the window should locate on the wall. The tolerance in your Rhino file is very high which causes the issue. For example there is a case that the window is outside the wall (image below) but since the difference is less then the tolerance Honeybee considers the surface to be on the wall but then it will cause issues when it tries to split the window from the wall.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/088*6UBF7TAo-Ae7tvjav-Sdz6DdkU9ca7I8et*3ROfocnI0NogW1fGTHDeZDlkPP78XxXsWnEL3wzKHQx7m56z4zj-SxZqC/missed_window.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/088*6UBF7TAo-Ae7tvjav-Sdz6DdkU9ca7I8et*3ROfocnI0NogW1fGTHDeZDlkPP78XxXsWnEL3wzKHQx7m56z4zj-SxZqC/missed_window.JPG)\n\nBeing planar is also relative to tolerance. As Claudio mentioned Radiance needs planar surfaces with accuracy of 10^-6 of the unit. The tolerance in your model is 0.1 which means a surface can be planar in your model but won't be planar from Radiance point of you. In many cases you can disregard the warning but in your case it's causing issue with exporting the geometry.\n\n\n\nMy suggestion is to redraw your model with a smaller tolerance value. That will solve many of the issues. If you set the tolerance to 0.01 and re-run the Grasshopper you'll see that many of windows will be missing which needs to be fixed by redrawing the windows or the wall or both.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 07, 2016 at 05:27PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1433195", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1433784"}
