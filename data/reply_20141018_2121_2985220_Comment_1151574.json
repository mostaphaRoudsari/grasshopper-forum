{"body": "\nHi Simone,\n\nChris's method does what you need. You can connect a series of numbers and graft them instead animating the slider and then remove record component and the panel for faster calculation.\n\nYou can also use annual daylight recipe with Honeybee, and change the type to radiation analysis. Then you can use read hourly results from annual study to get the results for all the hours.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 18, 2014 at 09:21PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1149748", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151574"}
