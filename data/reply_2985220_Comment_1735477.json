{"body": "\nThank you so much for your help. That seems really good and it completely works as a start, I just have to introduce internal windows to that. My intention was to introduce internal windows between atriums and internal spaces so I divided the zones. Also for next steps I may need to define different conditions for different zones. Don't know if I can make that to work. But the model that you sent me is a big help. Thanks again for your time.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nMitra\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mitra Sajjadi", "created_at": "April 19, 2017 at 1:25am", "created_by": "MitraSajjadi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1735438", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1735477"}
