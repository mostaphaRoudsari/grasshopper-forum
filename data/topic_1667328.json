{"body": "\nHello everyone\n\nI check the results of LadyBug radiationAnalysis component with energy plus result for\n\nSurface Outside Face Incident Beam Solar Radiation Rate per Area [W/m2](Hourly) .\n\nI have checked the energy plus InputOutputReference and the explanation for this output variable is :\n\n1.9.45.13<br/>Surface Outside Face Incident Beam Solar Radiation Rate per Area [W/m2]<br/>The solar beam radiation incident on the outside of an exterior surface, including the effects of shadowing, if present. The beam here is that directly from the<br/>sun; it excludes beam specularly reflected from obstructions.\n\nDose radiationAnalysis calculate the same thing?can any one explain ?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mostafa", "created_at": "January 5, 2017 at 10:18am", "created_by": "mostafa", "topic": "why LadyBug radiationAnalysis and energyplus differ in results?", "id": "topic_1667328"}
