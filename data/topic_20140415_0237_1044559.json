{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI'm an Italian student at the University of Pisa. Due to the fact that I'm doing my thesis through Ladybug and Honeybee I had to verify Ladybug+Honeybee data reliability. Down here you will be able to check them. The analysis has been run for [Pisa](http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata/6_europe_wmo_region_6/ITA_Pisa.161580_IWEC.zip) during May, September and January.\n\n\n\nReading the results I have extracted from the softwares I can say they are quite good. The data pattern is fine and the most difference can be found on the north exposition. This is because of the Italian Regulation Data that you will find inside\u00a0data_matching.gh takes the values through the Liu-Jordan model, considering different mode to build sky dome (isotropic). Indeed Ladybug or Honeybee use an anitropic sky model Perez-based.\n\n\n\nPleased to know your opinions,\n\n\n\nClaudio Campanile\n\n\n\nPS:\u00a0I have internalized data and turned off the radiance tool toggle to not choke your pc as you open the file.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1044558", "name": "data_matching.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "April 15, 2014 at 02:37AM", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "topic": "Data reliability", "id": "topic_1044559"}
