{"body": "\nThank you, it worked! I was able to use your component successfully to change the .epw file by substituting in my data.<br/><br/>I then tried to feed the new EPW file into the following components: genCumulativeSkyMtx \u00a0&gt; selectSkyMtx &gt; SkyDome for visualization. This required an Ladybug update, so i used the update component to update everything from 0.0.63 to 0.0.64.
