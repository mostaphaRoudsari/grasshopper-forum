{"body": "\nHi Dan,\n\nClaudio answered your initial question so I just reply to the new ones.\n\n1. Yes. You can use the component but make sure to update your components and use the latest. I mistakenly put EPConstruction input for the component however EnergyPlus doesn't consider the constructions for site shadings. There are alternate methods that you can use if it is critical to have this effect in energy simulation.\n\n\n\n2. If you are still using the same geometry that I have seen before, then set the quality to 1, and add -ab to a higher number. That should save you some time.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 24, 2014 at 11:26AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1120585", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1120688"}
