{"body": "\nMike,\n\nYour hypothesis sounds promising and I think that it might explain the situation. \u00a0Abraham, to clarify why using the selectedSkyMtx might not address the issue, the GenCumSky component is still running to produce a matrix for the entire year and the selectSkyMtx only pulls certain values out of this based on the analysisPeriod. \u00a0I'm going to try a test now where we only replace one day in the EPW with the radiation data (istead of replacing the whole year) and see if this fixes it.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 17, 2017 at 1:10pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714070", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714577"}
