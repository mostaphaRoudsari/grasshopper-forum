{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI have a suggestion, if it is possible to make, for a new output (or a modification of the existing one) for the\u00a0Sunlight Hours Analysis component. Often is important to calculate on a facade the direct sunlight hours per node per day. With the actual component it is not possible (I think). You can calculate only totals (per node=sunlightHoursResult output and all the nodes=totalSunlightHours output). What is interesting the existing output\u00a0sunIsVisible but the thing is that it considers the hours of sun from the sunrise to the sunset so when you try to split the list using the 24h it doesn't work (fig 1). So if you don't know for every day of the analysis period the duration of the day you cannot split the list coming from the output sunIsVisible (Fig 1). To overpass this I had to calculate the actual hours of the day for every day of the analysis period from the sunPositionInfo of the SunPath component (Fig 2) but it is very tricky. So what I suggest is to add a second sunIsVisible outup but on the 24 hours. Thank you!!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/odYCBfvo76ZGFaz8aruSM*pRZImnAYqNeFhE60yRhqIsVcSi266Nouq7Hl57UnbvKyMPtB41ChCHR4C7QZoO7lmikWsEbIbA/24h.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/odYCBfvo76ZGFaz8aruSM*pRZImnAYqNeFhE60yRhqIsVcSi266Nouq7Hl57UnbvKyMPtB41ChCHR4C7QZoO7lmikWsEbIbA/24h.JPG)\n\nFig 1\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/odYCBfvo76a*vn6kvRCmcJyKZF53tFEUZtn5UuWSOvULAhj8KZpOjk44NlZBCMB83bNocAqB8Xbb*odORzKdunhTa0LrcE-x/varh.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/odYCBfvo76a*vn6kvRCmcJyKZF53tFEUZtn5UuWSOvULAhj8KZpOjk44NlZBCMB83bNocAqB8Xbb*odORzKdunhTa0LrcE-x/varh.JPG)\n\nFig 2\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "November 19, 2015 at 6:43am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "Sunlight Hours Analysis output", "id": "topic_1404582"}
