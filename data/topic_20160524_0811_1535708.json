Why did you use gendaymtx for the ladybug solar analysis but genCumSky for the Honeybee irradiance studies?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIs it possible to use gendaymtx for interior irradiance studies (with windows)? I assume that you can since it is actually producing a Radiance scene.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you for any insights!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "May 24, 2016 at 08:11AM", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "topic": "The difference between genCumulativeSkyMtx and genCumSky", "id": "topic_1535708"}
