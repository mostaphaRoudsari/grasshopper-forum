{"body": "\nHi\n\nI'm trying to find hourly horizontal sky illuminance.. I did use the example:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;amp...;](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Honeybee_Annual_Daylight_Simulation_Example)\n\nwhich use DAYSIM to find the daylight autonomy... I looked at the result folder and find internal illuminance, where it\u00a0started from 0.5 hour?!\u00a0\n\nMy question: is there is a way to find the horizontal sky illuminance\n\nand is it possible to have the internal illuminance estimated on the hour and half the hour ..\n\n\n\nthanks and appreciate your help\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1421947", "name": "1.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1421948", "name": "Honeybee_Annual_Daylight_Simulation_Example.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Khalid Al", "created_at": "December 15, 2015 at 11:51AM", "created_by": "KhalidAl", "topic": "finding the horizontal sky illuminace", "id": "topic_1421949"}
