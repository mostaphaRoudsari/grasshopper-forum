{"body": "\nHi Elzine,\n\n\n\nI think the surface normals for your glazings might be facing inwards. If I remember correctly, the code looks for the direction of the surface normals and then creates extrusions in that direction. This error will (hopefully) be resolved if you flip your glazing surfaces.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "January 28, 2016 at 07:20PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1449360", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1449627"}
