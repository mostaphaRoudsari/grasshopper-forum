{"body": "\nAhmad,\n\nVery good question but unfortunately, Radiance really isn't built to model light's wave-like properties.\u00a0 It's ray-tracing methods are exceptionally good at modeling illuminance in all of its forms but I don't think there's a rendering engine that currently exists that is able to model light refraction and diffraction in the way that you are describing.\u00a0 Sarith (one of the great Radiance gurus of our community) should confirm this but he already explained to me why light diffraction isn't modeled with Radiance here:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/issues/597](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/issues/597)\n\nExtending his explanation, we can also conclude that it can't model prisms and light refraction in the way that you describe.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 17, 2017 at 01:49PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1752950", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1753335"}
