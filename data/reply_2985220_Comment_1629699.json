{"body": "\nHi Bi,<br/><br/>1. Check\u00a0[this topic](www.grasshopper3d.com/xn/detail/2985220:Comment:1579727) for some explanations on your first question.<br/>Also Ladybug Photovoltaics can calculate shading impact on the final energy output.<br/><br/>2. There are two ways to calculate optimal tilt and azimuth angles:<br/>a) more precise, and slower one: by using Galapagos solver, and by iterating through tilt and azimuth angle sliders, until the optimal tilt and azimuth if found. Here is an [example video](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/video/annual-optimal-tilt-and-azimuth-angle-of-an-unshaded-pv-array), with [example definition](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p1bg0ved74sk983/optimal_tilt_azimuth_openRack.gh?dl=0).<br/><br/>b) less precise and quicker one: by using \"Tilt and Orientation Factor (TOF)\" component:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vl6FuIcyK*vPCGivX**UEG0Yg-8Giap6*Y3DeJtzDDw3Up5exSeV3WbbakcikGH2vyiLJ6bYobGMxDRczFPBFtQFttmLYuXP/2b.jpg?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vl6FuIcyK*vPCGivX**UEG0Yg-8Giap6*Y3DeJtzDDw3Up5exSeV3WbbakcikGH2vyiLJ6bYobGMxDRczFPBFtQFttmLYuXP/2b.jpg)\n\nHave in mind that the differences between 2)a) and 2)b) may mostly be less than 1 degree.\n\n<br/>To calculate the minimal distance between PV rows (the \"density you mentioned\"), which will eliminate the\u00a0[self shading](http://www.greenrhinoenergy.com/solar/performance/shading.php) from front PV rows, use the \"PV SWH system size\" component.\n\n<br/>I attached an example definition for 2)b) option below along with minimal distance calculation.<br/><br/>Let us know if you have any other issue or question!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1629701", "name": "optimalPV_tilt_azimuth_minDistance.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "November 1, 2016 at 8:23am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "topic_1629877", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1629699"}
