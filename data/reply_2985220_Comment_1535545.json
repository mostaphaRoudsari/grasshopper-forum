{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI have the same issue with the 'EPZone' object has no attribute 'cenPt' error.\n\nI've looked through all the forum posts about this, and I've checked my file multiple times...\n\nI tried putting the HB_HB back using Ctrl+B\n\nI tried re-enabling it\n\nI restarted my computer several times just in case...\n\nI checked the zone names but they seem to be fine...\n\nAttached are the internalized geometry with the script and an epw file that I used. Hopefully it will work for you so that will mean something with my HB version is wrong, I just don't want to re-install everything until that is the case.\n\nThanks :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yafim Simanovsky", "created_at": "May 23, 2016 at 10:24am", "created_by": "YafimSimanovsky", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1445782", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535545"}
