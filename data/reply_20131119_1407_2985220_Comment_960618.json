{"body": "\nUgur,\n\nI've playing a lot with the last file you uploaded. The results completely make sense to me. First of all i suggest to show always the legend so you can see what the colors represent.If you show a summer day (say 21.6) you'll see big differences between the vertical and the inclined planes. The radiation in vertical is much lower than in horizontal or inclined. As for winter (say 21.12) the vertical or slightly inclined (as in your example) the radiation is pretty similar. I hope i understood your points and that this helps.\n\n-A.\n\nPS Mostapha: Another one for you. See the attached. I tried to show the results of the RealTimeRadiation in the surfaces but didn't succeed. The results list is different than the one from the RadiationAnalysis component. Don't know how to change the List format. Can you suggest?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A960619", "name": "ANOTHERSURFACES_A.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 19, 2013 at 02:07PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_960517", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_960618"}
