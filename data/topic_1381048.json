{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to make a comfort analysis using Honeybee's comfort tools. One of the required inputs are srfIndoorTemp, which should come from the EP result. But the EP srf results have an uniform temperature distribution e.g. the whole floor is 18C.\u00a0\n\nMy question is; do you have any suggestions on how to make a more accurate surface temperature distribution?\u00a0\n\nMy thought was to use a radiation analysis and then somehow relate that to the EP result.\n\n\n\nCheers \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Kongsgaard", "created_at": "October 18, 2015 at 4:29am", "created_by": "ChristianKongsgaard", "topic": "Surface temperature distribution - Comfort analysis", "id": "topic_1381048"}
