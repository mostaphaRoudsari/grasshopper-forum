{"body": "\nJulia,\n\nYou can get the radiation using the HB_gridBasedSimulation and setting the _simulationType_ input to 1 (radiation). Pretty straightforward.\n\nThis [example](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Honeybee_Grid-based_Daylight_Simulation_Example_I&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0) can serve as a starting point. Is for daylight but just need to change the simulation type and probably the sky type.\n\nIf more help needed let me know, but i have the feeling you'll manage.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 09, 2017 at 10:22AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1688545", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1688377"}
