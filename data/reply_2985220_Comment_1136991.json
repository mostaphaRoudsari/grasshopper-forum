{"body": "\nHi Ben,\n\nIs that the case both for Ladybug and Honeybee? Ladybug shouldn't take long at all to load. In case of Honeybee the first time that you let it fly, it downloads a number of files that you can find in installation folder. I wonder if that is the reason of 4-5 minutes?\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 25, 2014 at 1:56am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1136843", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1136991"}
