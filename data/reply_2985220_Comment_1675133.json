{"body": "\nHi Charlene and Sarith!\n\nI just yesterday arrived at the same problem. I would like to run an annual simulation with both windows and IES-files and would love it if you could share your workaround for this. I try, and the IES-files works fine at a single point in time, but there seems to be some problem when Daysim is included.\n\n\n\nIt would be preferable for me if the IES files could be controlled like shading as discussed here: [http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/ldt-file-an...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/ldt-file-and-ies-file-interior-light-contribute-in-annual) , but if not I will run multiple simulations and slice the data afterwards!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anna Larsson", "created_at": "January 19, 2017 at 8:48am", "created_by": "AnnaLarsson", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1670857", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1675133"}
