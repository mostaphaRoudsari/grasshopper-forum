{"body": "\nHi everyone!\n\n\n\nI am totally new at grasshopper, honeybee and ladybug :)\u00a0\n\n\n\nI've been following Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari's youtube tutorials, and I have a problem with my test points - I believe that the wrong data is being shown.\n\n<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/b*u3sBO-oVU4p4HanzQFHvkjGF82nxdOCQd78JmGrCWH-gKkDRLm03sjAuo*cpLLkZPoEKe--kXYZdRJNWALZjnopS1jKk1q/ScreenShot20160331at8.58.15AM.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>\n\nI know that I have connected the 'illuminance files' from RunDaylightAnalysis to the '_results files' of ReadRADResults - which I think is incorrect as I should be connecting RAD files to it instead. I think that these RAD files should be within the 'radGeoFiles' from\u00a0RunDaylightAnalysis, but when connecting these together I obtain a rederror message saying 'Solution exception: need more than 1 value to unpack'.[<br/>](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topic/listForContributor?user=2o71qkfqc6voq)\n\n\n\nI have updated all components and re-loaded the specific components.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI really appreciate your help - thanks in advance! :)\u00a0\n\n\n\n/Sara\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1497098", "name": "006_Parametric_GridBasedAnalysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sara L.
