{"body": "\nHitoKanto,\n\nSorry for such a late reply as things have been busy with my thesis recently. \u00a0Also, sorry for\u00a0the confusion about the page of climate consultant that has the comfort model info.\n\nYou can and should put only one or a few values in for Mean Rad Temperature input. \u00a0Remember that this is the radiant temperature that is used to generate the comfort polygon and that radiant temperature is, itself, not plotted on the Psychrometric chart. \u00a0Effectively, what you are telling the psych chart component to do there is to generate a comfort polygon for each and every air temperature for every hour of the year (so 8760 comfort polygons). \u00a0Normally, I think that this process would run for hours into oblivion but I am glad that you get an error instead.\n\nTo further clarify, the \"Comfort Highest/Lowest Temp calculated by PMV model\" inputs on this climate consultant page are what are setting the radiant temperature of the climate consultant comfort polygon:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-FxrWMrAPzgUJS2oAyZf8UJPOzDuUm8ryJj46nACw0-L0gpVLT5l0fKWGD4V1ZgkQNyTx*ba5WGKEv9VWjrygPB5h1eXmUfZ/ClimConsult.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-FxrWMrAPzgUJS2oAyZf8UJPOzDuUm8ryJj46nACw0-L0gpVLT5l0fKWGD4V1ZgkQNyTx*ba5WGKEv9VWjrygPB5h1eXmUfZ/ClimConsult.PNG)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 10:43am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1268885", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1278858"}
