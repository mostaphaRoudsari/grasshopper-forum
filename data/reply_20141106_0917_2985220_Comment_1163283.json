{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\u00a0\n\nI look forward to testing it out when it's ready.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChris, your idea of using the Honeybee CB module is perfect. This should allow me to do exactly what I need if it can calculate sub-hourly skies. Once I generate a custom matrix of skies, how do I combine them back into the skyFilePath format so I can use it in the other Honeybee components? I can use this custom sky with a basic single-ray calc, but have been unable to translate this into a format radiance can use. I was hoping your new Honeybee components could get me there.\u00a0Do you know a way?\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlso, what sky models are used to create the luminance distributions? CIE clear/overcast/intermediate, Perez, Kittler, or a combination of others? There are so many.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks for your help.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "November 06, 2014 at 09:17AM", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1162866", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163283"}
