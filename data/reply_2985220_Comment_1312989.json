{"body": "\nHey John,\n\nYou can actually do it currently with Honeybee (using daysim advanced components) but it will take much longer as Daysim will simulate the cases with and without blinds! I think your current approach is more efficient. In any case, check the advanced example in Honeybee example files if you want to see how you can do it with Honeybee.\n\nIf you still want to keep it all in Grasshopper take a look at \"Honeybee_Read All the Hourly Results from Annual Daylight Study\" It lets you load all the results into Grasshopper and then you can apply the logic here inside the Grasshopper for post-processing.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 21, 2015 at 4:51pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1308772", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1312989"}
