{"body": "\nHi Kyle,\n\nThere are couple of issues in the file.\n\n1. If you want to have a list in a panel, you need to right click and remove Multiline Data. You were generating zones with similar names.\n\n2. You can use a single component for solveAdjacency. Identical names and using multiple solveAdjacency was making duplicate zones in your model.\n\n3. You were assigning Opaque construction to windows. You can't do this in EnergyPlus. Maybe I should add an extra check for this to give a warning to users. It wasn't your fault though. The component returns Wall constructions which it shouldn't. I will get that fixed, but meanwhile you can use search to filter window constructions. See attached file.\n\n\n\nHere is a screenshot of the results. I also updated Honeybee_Honeybee component in your file so result visualization won't fail. Unfortunately our update component doesn't work at the moment but you can always sync with github manually.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8fil5gmLgTbRTV*QONkjrSZuEFn35penqENd*Qx6lPvk7E6lm99j-7AWd-RJZ1XMbOHsBW0Zc4RTCLFaFEFfa-dHhy1NKAzS/zoneColoredBasedOnEnergyUse_Perspective.png\" width=\"583\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/8fil5gmLgTbRTV*QONkjrSZuEFn35penqENd*Qx6lPvk7E6lm99j-7AWd-RJZ1XMbOHsBW0Zc4RTCLFaFEFfa-dHhy1NKAzS/zoneColoredBasedOnEnergyUse_Perspective.png)\n\nBest of luck,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1175677", "name": "ZoneModel_3_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 25, 2014 at 10:17PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1175126", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1175675"}
