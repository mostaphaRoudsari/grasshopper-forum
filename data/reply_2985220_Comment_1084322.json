{"body": "\nOk, the medium-quality study has taken me a little bit longer 40 hours (!).<br/>To be sure that .gh and results matching I'll upload the gh file as well.\n\nAs you can see in the file, I have modelled an office room out of my building to control as good as possible the external shading. Indeed the rest of the building is shaped making it simpler enough to not make my laptop-RAM explode (despite its good performances).\n\nIn the gh definition you will see 6 grids (5 in the building + 1 in the office test). I am not sure about results of the shading group 1 (windows) on the 6th grid which is of the office test.\n\n\n\nThis is the result-file:\u00a0[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13141514/annual_mediumQ.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13141514/annual_mediumQ.zip)\n\n\n\nThank you very much,\n\nClaudio\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1084323", "name": "hall_annual_study_00 (II).gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "June 6, 2014 at 2:20am", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1082815", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1084322"}
