{"body": "\nTasos,\n\nI have a hunch about what the problem is. \u00a0If you drop a new Honeybee_Honeybee onto your canvass or if your Honeybee_Honeybee component does not lie further back on the canvass than your writeToProjectLibrary component, your project material library is overwritten by the copying of Honeybee_Honeybee classes to your system memory. \u00a0So you need to send your Honeybee_Honeybee to the back of the canvass by selecting it and hitting Cntrl+B. \u00a0Next, try re-run your writeToProjectLibrary component by disabling it and enabling it. \u00a0Then, use the run simulation component again and let us know if it works. \u00a0If not, upload your GH file.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 20, 2015 at 07:51PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228420", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228568"}
