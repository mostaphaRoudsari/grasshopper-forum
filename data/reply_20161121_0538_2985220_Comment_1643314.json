{"body": "\nHi Fransesco!\n\n\n\nThanks for sharing the example with us! Great job! And thanks for catching our mistake in the example file, it will be rectified shortly! The pressure is calculated based on the reference condition I believe, which yes usually this is 0. Bare in mind that OF divides pressure by density, so if you want the 'real' pressure you would need to multiply the results by 1.205 (perhaps we add this in BF at some point but it's easy in native GH).\n\n\n\nVector based velocity is a very good idea, and a nice and easy way to model these kind of flows!\n\n\n\nIf you wish to experiment even further with the custom boundary condition components you can try implementing a flowRateInletVelocity boundary condition (see\u00a0[https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-3.0.x/blob/master/src/finiteVo...](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-3.0.x/blob/master/src/finiteVolume/fields/fvPatchFields/derived/flowRateInletVelocity/flowRateInletVelocityFvPatchVectorField.H))\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt will allow you set the flows in m3/s, which is handy for usual HVAC specs. The direction of the patch follows the normal of the surface. Setting a minus in the volumetric flow rate assigns an opposite direction.\n\n\n\nThanks for using and sharing! Keep them coming!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\nP.S.: Try this as an expirement. Increase the refinement of your mesh, factor of 4 should be nice. You can simply reduce the the blockMesh cell size by 4 to accomplish that. Try running the case and see the impact on the residual graph.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "November 21, 2016 at 05:38AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1643066", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1643314"}
