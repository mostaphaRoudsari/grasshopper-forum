{"body": "\nHi\n\nI have setup UWG, Matlab etc (2015b, not latest version of Matlab) as per instructions.\u00a0\n\nTo check the installation works I have downloaded and tried running the Singapore example file.\u00a0\n\nStep 1 runs.\n\nStep 2 fails. Error Message is that the weather file is missing. I think this is because of the space in the file name that appears to have crept in in the 2017-06-05_1-17-57 image attached. This is presumably in the UWG component within Dragonfly\n\nThe actual error message states \"Could not find version 9.0 of the Matlab runtime. And a few other explanatory words. I cannot replicate this now, but part of the problem seemed to be on the first run that the path in which Dragonfly was looking for UWG was\u00a0C:\\ladybug\\\\UWG.\n\nI am wondering if this is because of the code shown\u00a0below. It seems to me that the code at lines 980-988 in the Dragonfly \"Main\" component sets the UWG program to be in folder DragonFly_Installation\\UWG\\ BUT in lines 112-119 the\u00a0Dragonfly_Installation is set to C;\\ladybug\\\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nCode at: lines 980-988 in Dragonfly main component\n\n\n\nif checkIn.letItFly:<br/>sc.sticky[\"dragonfly_release\"] = versionCheck() <br/> <br/>if sc.sticky.has_key(\"dragonfly_release\") and sc.sticky[\"dragonfly_release\"]:<br/>folders = df_findFolders()<br/>sc.sticky[\"dragonfly_folders\"] = {}<br/>if folders.UWGPath == None:<br/>if os.path.isdir(sc.sticky[\"Dragonfly_DefaultFolder\"] + \"\\\\UWG\\\\\"):<br/>folders.UWGPath = sc.sticky[\"Dragonfly_DefaultFolder\"] + \"\\\\UWG\\\\\"\n\n\n\nBUT:\u00a0\n\nEarlier (Lines 112-119) the Dragonfly_DefaultFolder was set thus:\n\n#set up default pass<br/>if not self.folderIsSetByUser:<br/>if os.path.exists(\"c:\\\\ladybug\\\\\") and os.access(os.path.dirname(\"c:\\\\ladybug\\\\\"), os.F_OK):<br/># folder already exists so it is all fine<br/>sc.sticky[\"Dragonfly_DefaultFolder\"] = \"c:\\\\ladybug\\\\\"<br/>elif os.access(os.path.dirname(\"c:\\\\\"), os.F_OK):<br/>#the folder does not exists but write privileges are given so it is fine<br/>sc.sticky[\"Dragonfly_DefaultFolder\"] = \"c:\\\\ladybug\\\\\"\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1763294", "name": "2017-06-05_1-12-25.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1763295", "name": "2017-06-05_1-17-57.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Michael Donn", "created_at": "June 4, 2017 at 7:30am", "created_by": "MichaelDonn", "topic": "Dragonfly code question?", "id": "topic_1763296"}
