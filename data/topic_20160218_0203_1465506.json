{"body": "\nHi All.<br/><br/>I have recently been diving into LB+HB.<br/>After a slight bumb its now running smoothly (wuhoo great work devs) and I am making template files for the architecture office i'm working at. <br/><br/>A colleague made an interesting question:Is it possible to run the simulation in silent mode?<br/>So the cmd.exe shell window does not pop up?\n\n\n\nThis made me think: Is it possible to make the shell window hidden and somehow pass a progress status from the simulation into grasshopper?<br/>So it would be possible to make a \"Simulation running\" pop up in the grasshopper window or in the 3D viewport until its done.\n\nThis would make the experience of using LB+HB very smooth in everyday uses. And could be nothing more than a Boolean value. Output:\"simulation running\" -&gt; True or False\n\n\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ejnar Brendsdal", "created_at": "February 18, 2016 at 02:03AM", "created_by": "EjnarBrendsdal", "topic": "Running Simulation in silent mode?
