{"body": "\nJoe,\n\nI'm glad that this worked.\n\nI am pretty sure that the reason why you cannot use ironpython's copy.deepcopy() function is a result of your version of Rhino and not your operating system. \u00a0I think that older service releases of Rhino were using a different type of ironpython or something like that. \u00a0If you can update your service release of Rhino that might fix it.\n\nOtherwise, I'm glad that you have what you need now.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 15, 2017 at 6:30pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1713106", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1713268"}
