{"body": "\nHello Grasshope,\n\n\n\nAs far as I know, the development of the actual Butterfly component and its code is currently underway and I know Mostapha will have much more actual news to share on this as he is the one developing it. I believe it is becoming a priority along with cleaning up LB/HB API.\n\n\n\nMe and Chris have also worked for some time in a workflow that links CFD results (coming from OpenFoam) to LB/HB and specifically his micro-climate components. Initial results have been very encouraging and we are just currently looking for a bit of free time to run a few more studies and comparisons in order to assess the accuracy of the method.\n\n\n\nSince Chris is the one developing the code and tools within the work flow I will leave it up to him to decide when he thinks they are stable enough to share. We are also looking forward to that since we understand how important an active community like LB/HB's will be in developing this further.\n\n\n\nAs for learning materials I would recommend you download and install OpenFoam in either platform you prefer, and then going over the amazing User Guide provided. It will work you through a couple of the (many) tutorials that are available within the installation of the software.\n\nAfter that, almost every question that you will have has been asked and answered here:\n\n\n\n[www.cfd-online.com](http://www.cfd-online.com)\n\n\n\nIt is quite a steep curve but after a bit of head smashing on the keyboard it gets much much easier.\n\n\n\nFeel free to ask anything here, either in PM or in this thread maybe and I'll gladly help if I can.\n\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 26, 2016 at 9:08pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1536958", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537281"}
