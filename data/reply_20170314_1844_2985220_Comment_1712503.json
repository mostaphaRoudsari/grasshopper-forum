{"body": "\nJoe,\n\nThis is not an ideal solution to the problem because, in the best scenario, we would find a way to get copy.deepcopy() to work on your machine. \u00a0However, because the THERM workflow really only involves the therm polygon components and the writing component, you actually don't have a need to copy the objects here (as you would with some other Honeybee components like those for energy simulation). \u00a0Accordingly, I made a change to the code on the github so that the THERM workflow doesn't copy the objects and everything should now work for you:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/commit/f36dd65a6136908...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/commit/f36dd65a61369083335c15c7d45b2a8a084aa2dc)\n\nThe working components are in the attached GH file and let me know if they fix the issue on your system.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1712504", "name": "CurtainWallTest_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 14, 2017 at 06:44PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1712578", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1712503"}
