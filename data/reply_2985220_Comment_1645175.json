{"body": "\nOK, so if I understand this correctly I need to first figure out what my demand is, then it will size the PV array (square meters) to accommodate that demand.<br/><br/>If I was interested in calculating a certain system output (kWh) based on surface square footage that is available to me, then i would need to give it a \"fake\" demand. This would be a sort of backwards way of finding out what is the possible max output of a system of certain square footage coverage...and later I can compare that against my actual demand when that becomes known to me. Of course I understand that this is ass backwards and not the intended use for your components, but unfortunately at the moment I don't know what the demand is. I will find out sooner or later. :-)\u00a0<br/><br/>Thanks for all the help. I think I am getting closer to figuring out what is what in these components. I would hate to perform any sort of analysis without having at least some basic understanding of what's happening and you have sure helped me here.\u00a0<br/><br/>Cheers!\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "konrad k sobon", "created_at": "November 23, 2016 at 7:19pm", "created_by": "konradksobon", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1645164", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1645175"}
