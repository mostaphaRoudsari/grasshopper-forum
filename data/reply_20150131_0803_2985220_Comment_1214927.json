{"body": "\nHi Theodores,\n\nIf you want to use Ladybug components you can use Ladybug_Capture View component and animate slider to export the images for each time step and then use another tool like Windows Movie Maker or online gif makers to make an animation. I assume they should be more sophisticated ways to do this with some other plugins.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/lQ0QUhfJdPHjn17GDFcq7swGf1kDKKBOuSW1CG3qTLlSS8F4ZX6COrgLl5R7nQ*1UpRG3etqs2RnZK*DNnJugxc0IsvsR8Wh/output_XsVcZC.gif\" width=\"620\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/lQ0QUhfJdPHjn17GDFcq7swGf1kDKKBOuSW1CG3qTLlSS8F4ZX6COrgLl5R7nQ*1UpRG3etqs2RnZK*DNnJugxc0IsvsR8Wh/output_XsVcZC.gif)\n\n\n\n\n\nRight click and animate the slider in the attached file and it will capture top and perspective views for first day of the year for few hours of the day.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1214929", "name": "animateSunPath.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 31, 2015 at 08:03AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1214921", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1214927"}
