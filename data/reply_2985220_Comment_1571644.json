{"body": "\nVinu,\n\nIf what you are asking about is whether we can translate the OSM to an IDF but not run the IDF through E+, I think that is a great idea. I wouldn't want to implement this capability on the 'Export to OS' component because I imagine that, more often than not, people just want to simulate and the extra boolean toggle could be annoying. \u00a0However, I can add it on the Re-Run OSM component and I have opened an issue for it here:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/542](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/542)\n\nYour error results from you not updating all of your components (including HB_HB). \u00a0Make sure that they are all up to date and it should work.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 26, 2016 at 10:22pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571582", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571644"}
