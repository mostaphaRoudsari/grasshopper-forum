{"body": "\nHi, Abraham,\n\nYou are right, I tried with the box and it works well. The reason I ask about the surface situation is for the data size. If I use a box, it will give me result for all 6 surfaces while I might only need one (like simulate for solar panel), the results then became quite redundant.\n\nBut I think I should try 360 degrees instead of 180, that should work.\n\n-Q\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Qinheng", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 12:47PM", "created_by": "Qinheng", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1518553", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519058"}
