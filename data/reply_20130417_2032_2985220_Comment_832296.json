{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nThe length shows the magnitude of radiation form each direction but the thickness of arrows is just an\u00a0arbitrary relationship between the length of the arrow and the scale. It doesn't show anything special. I found the default value based on annual runs and that's why it doesn't give you a good graphic for a single day. I should fix it for the next release to work for both cases.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile you can manipulate the number in\u00a0genRadRoseArrows function in Ladybug_ladybug component and find the right relationship for your study.\n\n\n\nThere is a line as:\u00a0ptMoveDis = 20 * internalSc\n\nChange it to:\u00a0ptMoveDis = .20 * internalSc\n\n\n\nlet the modified version of Ladybug fly and re-run the radiation-rose. It should give you an acceptable graphic.\n\n\n\nThanks for reporting this and let me know if it didn't work so I can send you the modified version.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 17, 2013 at 08:32PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_830669", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_832296"}
