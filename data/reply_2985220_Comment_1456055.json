{"body": "\nThis is a great discussion!\n\n\n\nMauricio, Honeybee uses OpenStudio template as the default library. I'm sure OpenStudio team would be happy to hear your comments about the glazing data-set. In the next version we will add a new input to set-up the construction based on climate zone and modeling standard ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/398](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/398)).\n\n\n\nChris, The import Window material is huge.
