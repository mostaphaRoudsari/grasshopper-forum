It is good to know about the daysim subroutine but I prefer a method that lives entirely in grasshopper.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIs there a method to combine multiple sky files into a single cumulative sky that can then be input into the _skyFile input of the honeybee components?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3KGM3KZVxz5S8Ace1qF2Czxs0gJTvnHvXRvaoNG8-M14EKLDNjGflbD4e1jPZgsLUi3c6K8vgEtBzn-YJtcJ-1mWx-BAJaHd/Capture.JPG?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3KGM3KZVxz5S8Ace1qF2Czxs0gJTvnHvXRvaoNG8-M14EKLDNjGflbD4e1jPZgsLUi3c6K8vgEtBzn-YJtcJ-1mWx-BAJaHd/Capture.JPG)\n\n\u00a0\n\nAgain, thank you both for your time.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "November 10, 2014 at 08:35AM", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1165106", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1165623"}
