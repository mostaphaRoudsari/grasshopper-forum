{"body": "\nHi Abraham and Ugur,\n\n\n\nAbraham, I think all you needed was flattening the test points (Image below), however, It reminded me that I should unFlatten the test points from the realTimeRadiation analysis component. [I added this as an enhancement](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/36).\n\n\n\nUgur, as Abraham mentioned the results makes sense. I wonder if you are concerned about the drastic change in the color? You may want to use legendParameter and set the minimum to 0 so the colors make more sense. Something like image below.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/IivmNnZoXsmiIxieHqTYtu0-4hnqawJJ9Cv5ZVx-eGxWEm7f0fsfvJBeBlok6DKRnhGYCEqkJavcfKL4skONddqZP*pjN8a5/radiationAnalysisResultsRemap.png?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/IivmNnZoXsmiIxieHqTYtu0-4hnqawJJ9Cv5ZVx-eGxWEm7f0fsfvJBeBlok6DKRnhGYCEqkJavcfKL4skONddqZP*pjN8a5/radiationAnalysisResultsRemap.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A961092", "name": "ANOTHERSURFACES_A_MSR.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 20, 2013 at 7:52pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_960618", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_961091"}
