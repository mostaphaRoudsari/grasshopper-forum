{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI'm getting 0 KWhr for 'totalSolarGain' internally out of 'runEnergySimulation/readEPResult' for a very simple model with one zone. I have large windows facing north (Australia, so heat gains should be there).\n\nTried all I can think of e.g. changing window material/construction types etc. I've got an EPMaterial with UV/SHGC/VT input to SetEPZone and childSurfaces input to HBSurfaces further down the line.\n\nI'm doing something wrong, so any ideas out there?<br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/><br/>Rob\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1272962", "name": "Canvas 1.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1272963", "name": "Canvas 2.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1272964", "name": "Canvas 3.png"}], "created_by_name": "Robert Doe", "created_at": "April 26, 2015 at 12:37AM", "created_by": "RobertDoe", "topic": "totalSolarGain", "id": "topic_1272965"}
