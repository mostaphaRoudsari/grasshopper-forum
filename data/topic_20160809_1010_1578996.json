{"body": "\nRhino version: 5\n\nGrasshopper Version: 0.9.0076\n\nLadybug/Honeybee version: 0.0.61/0.0.58\n\nQuestion: Is there a way to get results from Ladybug/Honeybee into 3D PDF. I can get the model in through SimLab/Tetra 4D, but the results mesh (or vector \u2013 I have tried both) do not show up. I\u2019m assuming this is because they don\u2019t have a material associated with them?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Samantha Peart", "created_at": "August 09, 2016 at 10:10AM", "created_by": "SamanthaPeart", "topic": "3DPDFs of Ladybug/Honeybee results", "id": "topic_1578996"}
