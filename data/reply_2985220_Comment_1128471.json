{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI'm looking to run a basic thermal performance simulation, with an intended end result of analyzing heat flow on the glazing. Eventually I want to do this on non-planar surfaces, however for now I'm just trying it on simple planar geometry as I'm new to this and just want to get the basics down. I've set my geometry up similar to the posts in this discussion with the only addition being the EPconstruction to the glass. However when I bring the surface together I get a null HBzone and I'm wondering why that is. Also do the same principles apply with this as they do to irregular geometries. Such as do I have to always use 3 or more walls plus a groundplane and ceiling to create a zone, or can I use 1 or 2 non planar ribbon walls that wrap plus the groundplane and ceiling to create a zone?[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/A1Qs8*3Ts4wMVDvXZlJgjmpCv1l5Plki9s4kELzYvkcxR8GsWn6KN5Cl4YzX11hzHP9EJods1tzRoncO29QKeCixHk*xcoXe/script.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/A1Qs8*3Ts4wMVDvXZlJgjmpCv1l5Plki9s4kELzYvkcxR8GsWn6KN5Cl4YzX11hzHP9EJods1tzRoncO29QKeCixHk*xcoXe/script.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "September 8, 2014 at 2:20pm", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "parent_id": "topic_1045415", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1128471"}
