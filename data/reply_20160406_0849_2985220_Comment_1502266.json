{"body": "\nHi Ernst,\n\n\n\n1. Rhino crashes is almost always happening because of some split/intersection calculation. I think when you have the geometry as a single mass it fails to intersect them right at the connection when the change happens. If you move the plane a little bit higher I think it will solve the issue.\n\n\n\n2. It should not really happen. We will take a look into this and report back:\u00a0[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/499](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/499)\n\n\n\n3. Totally agree. The reason that we don't actively work on new features such as dumpHBZones is the fact that we're re-writing honeybee ([https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybeex](https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybeex)) were many of the current wishes will be address in a much more elegant way.\n\n\n\nThe current development, as powerful as it is, is limited by geometry operations of Grasshopper (Number 1 in your least) and is not as flexible as it should be in specific cases (number 2 in your case) and the new library will address this by providing an API which can work on top of Grasshopper or Dynamo or neither of them. That will open up opportunities to develop more flexible, customized workflows for cases such as yours.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 06, 2016 at 08:49AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1501600", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1502266"}
