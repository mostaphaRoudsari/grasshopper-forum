{"body": "\nJakob,\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs far as I know there is no straightforward solution for temperature responsive parameters. I think (don't quote me on this) Energy Plus, Radiance and all packages will calculate thermal transfer (u-values, material transmittance,absorptance and reflectance by timesteps, in a dynamic calculation, however there is no way to tap or alter any of these material characteristics mid-calculation; so it kind of behaves like a steady state calculation in that sense.\u00a0\n\nI don't know of any straightforward way to simulate dynamic materials that rely on E+ outputs (internal temp). However, as an ugly solution you could try to recursively generate a schedule by running multiple simulations and setting the shading schedule based on temperature outputs. E.g. first simulation without shading will give you a desired time to activate shading. Second sim will include shading starting at the previous time and will indicate when shading is no longer needed. you can repeat this until you have gone through the desired simulation period.\u00a0\n\ngood luck. Let me know if you figure out a better solution.\u00a0\n\n\n\nregards,\n\nMauricio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mauricio Aguilar Cardenas", "created_at": "March 30, 2016 at 04:01AM", "created_by": "MauricioAguilarCardenas135", "parent_id": "topic_1496352", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1496356"}
