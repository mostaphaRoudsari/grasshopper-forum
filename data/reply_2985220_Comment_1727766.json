{"body": "\nHi vhoang;<br/>I didn't understand your solution. you said \"You have to connect directly the directory of your weather file to analysisRecipe component\". Can you please send me an example or correct my algorithm? I will appreciate it. :)<br/>By the way you said that my vectors are downward! what do you mean? My goal is to analyze the radiation and daylight autonomy throughout the school year(9 months) to see how much radiation my classroom is getting. and also for DA I want to analyze how many percentage of my classroom is getting 300 lux of daylight in average.<br/>This is what I understand from honeybee and if there is something wrong with my algorithm please tell me that :)<br/>Best\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "leila pasandi", "created_at": "April 5, 2017 at 4:30am", "created_by": "leilapasandi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1727408", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1727766"}
