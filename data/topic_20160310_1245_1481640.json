{"body": "\nStepping out the Rhino-sphere and into Revit and Dynamo. I'm looking to analyze environmental dependent facades and having trouble wrapping my head around how to get there? Current workflow is taking a jpeg of a heat map, reading the hues as values and assigning dependencies. Ideally, I'd like to analyze the facade through Ladybug and assign variables to the range of radiation values and further analyze the results post intervention. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!\u00a0\n\n\n\nB\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bomin Kim", "created_at": "March 10, 2016 at 12:45PM", "created_by": "BominKim", "topic": "Ladybug + Dynamo", "id": "topic_1481640"}
