{"body": "\nChelle,\n\nI believe this can be a problem of tolerance and being exact in the modeling.\n\nSee attached files. In the rhino one you can see, if you zoom in very close, that both window and wall are not planar. I isolated the problematic cases in different layers so you can see better.\n\nCheck your tolerance units and/or fix the model as the attached files.\n\nHope this helps ... a bit.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 19, 2016 at 06:29AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1487961", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1488083"}
