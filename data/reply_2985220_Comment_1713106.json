{"body": "\n\n\nBingo! the revised Write component did export the thmx file without error. \u00a0I wasn't able to get Therm to do the calculation of course because as you already mentioned the curves were not being interpreted properly, so I have some geometry clean-up to do.\n\n\n\nI have not done any energy simulations with HB, so can't say whether the same problem occurs when creating HBZones.\n\n\n\nFor what it's worth, I did get the same error (re the copy module &amp; \"failed to call _polygons...\") on both my office computer and my home laptop.\n\nMaybe it's related to the geometry that was being referenced? \u00a0Some of the geometry plugged into the Write component without issue, while others triggered the error. \u00a0All the geometry came from Revit, via AutoCAD for some cleanup and flattening, then imported to Rhino - so maybe some strangeness was picked up along the way.\n\n\n\nThanks very much Chris for digging deeper and finding a workaround.\n\n\n\nJoe\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Joe Simms", "created_at": "March 15, 2017 at 11:34am", "created_by": "JoeSimma", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1712503", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1713106"}
