{"body": "\nHi! <br/><br/>I want to optimize a single zone for energy and light metrics using octopus. Simple enough. The examples i find use a **single** window varying in size &amp; placement. I want there to be up to 3 windows on the same surface that do not overlap but vary individually.<br/><br/>All the solutions I can come up with involve either random placement or renaming the XZ placement plane in such a way that it would disrupt octopus from learning about the genome as the generations progress.\u00a0My last hand solution is making a simple pixel grid, but making this work unfortunately allows for an unlimited number of windows.<br/><br/>Im sure this problem has been tackled before, so I'm putting it out here instead of inventing the wheel.. Thanks for ANY input!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "January 31, 2016 at 4:15pm", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "topic": "Placing multiple windows on facade for optimization", "id": "topic_1451552"}
