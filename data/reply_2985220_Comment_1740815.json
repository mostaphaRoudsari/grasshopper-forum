{"body": "\nErik,\n\nYes, I plan to fully integrate epw morphing for climate change\u00a0into Dragonfly. \u00a0At the moment, I don't have Dragonfly code or components for this but, in the webinar, I will go over how I recommend doing this morphing right now with the CCWeatherGen Excel tool:\n\n[http://www.energy.soton.ac.uk/ccworldweathergen/](http://www.energy.soton.ac.uk/ccworldweathergen/)\n\nI have been trying to contact the scientists who developed the tool to see if they would share their code, which will make it easier to integrate their methods with the rest of Ladybug Tools, update them to the most recent climate change projections, and fix a couple of bugs that we have found in the Excel tool. \u00a0I haven't been able to get a response from them so I imagine that I might just end up rebuilding their methods from their two most important papers:\n\n[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778808001400](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778808001400)\n\n[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1191/0143624405bt112oa](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1191/0143624405bt112oa)\n\nI'll explain more in the webinar.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 27, 2017 at 6:28am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1740712", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1740815"}
