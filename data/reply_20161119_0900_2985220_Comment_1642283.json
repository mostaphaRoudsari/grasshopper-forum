{"body": "\nHi Prof. Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks very much for your timely reply and great advice.\n\nThere are two more questions about your advice above:\n\n1. How to set up a higher tolerance? And what's the tolerance function about?\n\n2. So excited to hear the news of major modification of Honeybee, just want to make sure the exact version. As I see, you mentioned the Version available on GitHub, so is it the latest one not the Honeybee 0.0.60? If so, I should download the latest file on GitHub and get the version on my pc (equipped with 0.0.60 right now) replaced with it?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2DwxeRmxZZFIXj9nTpHHiHmRXZpKAFLHWghiDoa-qpQbAe0sj5MRjx1XJUL9wgwPVLzTulY2b8LMB9XvR0xlcPpxpJDhkq41/QQ2016111902x.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2DwxeRmxZZFIXj9nTpHHiHmRXZpKAFLHWghiDoa-qpQbAe0sj5MRjx1XJUL9wgwPVLzTulY2b8LMB9XvR0xlcPpxpJDhkq41/QQ2016111902x.png)\n\n\n\nI'll deeply appreciate it if you take the time to give me a hand.
