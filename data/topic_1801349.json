{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm getting this error using the psychometric chart:\n\n1. Comfort polygon has fallen completely off of the psych chart2.\n\nIt happens when i change the clo value to something like 2 or more. The truth is that when i gave a value of 1.886 is ok and 1.887 is not (metabolic = sitting).\n\nTrying to see what happens when i wear a high clo value (while sitting).\n\n\n\nAlso wanted to ask if how i can combine sitting, standing, sleeping with clo values of 0.6, 1, 3. See images.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/mF32r5guwc3hEDk-BE2DhyjEsxmKCu5TsQWzvCa-4LTrDIjZL2*i94p9ziZCsACG969HhIaCZP8EvedSXGeLfUbkaBKQUQvE/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/mF32r5guwc3hEDk-BE2DhyjEsxmKCu5TsQWzvCa-4LTrDIjZL2*i94p9ziZCsACG969HhIaCZP8EvedSXGeLfUbkaBKQUQvE/Capture.JPG)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/mF32r5guwc3-NCsp75ikIOU-0S9BcCnUK7Xl9DptW*1Edr67Qw4a1-3uaGYWta-aemSiUf-ujsF7HckNnV7k7cDzqUVDXn3G/Capture1.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/mF32r5guwc3-NCsp75ikIOU-0S9BcCnUK7Xl9DptW*1Edr67Qw4a1-3uaGYWta-aemSiUf-ujsF7HckNnV7k7cDzqUVDXn3G/Capture1.JPG)Also, following this discusion, i wish the issues mentioned there regarding the passive strategies were solved ... unfortunately y understood that they are not.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 21, 2017 at 3:08am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "PsyChart error", "id": "topic_1801349"}
