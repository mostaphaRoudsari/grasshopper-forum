{"body": "\nHi Juan,\n\n\n\nThat script on github is actually for Honeybee[+]. You can read about it [here](https://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2016-padua/presentations/213-SadeghipourSubramaniam-AutomatingWorkflows.pdf). If all goes to plan, we should have a public release of that sometime this month. The emphasis on that project, however, is on matrix-based daylighting simulation methods like the Three Phase method. So, I am not sure if Pcomb will be \"exposed\" for general use.\n\n\n\nAnyways, I had written a light wrapper for pcomb a while ago. I have cleaned it up a bit. You should be able to use it. See the attached gh file. As to what the script can do, see the video below:\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0W22IiyHbgM?wmode=opaque\" width=\"475\"></iframe>\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1687855", "name": "pcomb.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "February 08, 2017 at 07:32PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1687553", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1687854"}
