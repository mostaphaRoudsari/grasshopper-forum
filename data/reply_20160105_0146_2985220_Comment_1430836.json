{"body": "\nOk this is embarassing, I have no idea why I never responded to this. Maybe I gave up on what I was doing at the time.\n\n\n\nI came into an issue with BSDF again I wonder if I'm doign something wrong. I am getting an unknown material type \"BSDF\" error from radiance when I connect a Windows 7.4 xml glazing file using the radBSDFMaterial HB component.\n\n\n\nThe model is a simple box, just meant for testing thermochromic glazing. All components updated.\n\n\n\nI am attaching the xml file. The material definition seems right\n\n\n\nvoid BSDF ThermoTest<br/>6 0.000 C:/Users/Public/LBNL/WINDOW7.4/BSDFs/LowE.xml 0.000 0.000 1.000 .<br/>0<br/>0\n\n\n\nI have Radiance 4.1a installed, so it shouldn't be that. BTW can update to the last version and still have HB working? I should note that grid based analysis worked.\n\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1430837", "name": "LowE.xml"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1430838", "name": "LowE.csv"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 05, 2016 at 01:46AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1270552", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1430836"}
