{"body": "\nI have changed this error message from a couple of weeks ago. Are you sure that you have updated butterfly recently? You need to close both Rhino and Grasshopper after the update.\n\nIn any case, just from the images that you have updated there is an error with the OpenFOAM installation which doesn't really have to do with butterfly. Did you see any errors while installing OpenFOAM? I would suggest to post this issue on GitHub if re-installing didn't solve\u00a0 the problem.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 19, 2017 at 09:45AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1694787", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1694987"}
