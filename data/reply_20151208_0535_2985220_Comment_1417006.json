{"body": "\nHi Dwayne,<br/><br/>I'm not really an expert since I started using these tools just few weeks ago, but I think that if you run just daylighting analysis using Radiance as a software engine you have no problems in adding this \"isolated\" objects. You just have to assign them a radiance material using a\u00a0'Honeybee_createHBSrfs' panel and then plugging them into the \"_HBObjects\" input of the\u00a0\"Honeybee_Run Daylight Simulation\" panel.\n\nRadiance should not care about zones, if they're opened or closed etc..\n\nRegards,<br/>Claudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Marini", "created_at": "December 08, 2015 at 05:35AM", "created_by": "ClaudioMarini", "parent_id": "topic_1417072", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1417006"}
