{"body": "\nDaniel,\n\nThe material and construction i defined (AY-SF-065-080-130 and W_AY-SF-065-080-130) are at the file level (not library). They can't be referenced in your CustomizedLibrary unless you put them there (as you already know).. If you see the IDF look for them. at the Construction class and WindowMaterial:SimpleGlazing class. Just be aware that i've just defined something without thinking much about the values. They should fit a relatively good Low-e window.\n\nI updated the file (attached) and now you get the loads.\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1319911", "name": "150701_MATERIALS_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 03, 2015 at 11:21AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1319819", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1319910"}
