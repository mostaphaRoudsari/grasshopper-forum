{"body": "\nHello everybody,\n\n\n\nI'm a beginner on Ladybug. I have been practising Ladybug by watching all videos on Youtube. But there is a small problem showed up. When I was setting up point for textpoints, the points which were supposed to show up on the Rhino didn't show up and I thought It's probably because\u00a0I didn't link sunvetors but, after I linked sunvectors to Sunlight Hours Analysis, the programme stopped working. I don't know how to solve this one. I'm currently using 0.0.62 ver and the lastest one of grasshopper. Thanks for reading :D [<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/MlwUY2Ci1enDMX012UFFQmQO3kkPreovkt4EiIQsVD8myBy1lHFRYOBCBjLEGyj6hsooOAiflrLjjGIWWeKyZyhWUdjdI1cD/file.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/MlwUY2Ci1enDMX012UFFQmQO3kkPreovkt4EiIQsVD8myBy1lHFRYOBCBjLEGyj6hsooOAiflrLjjGIWWeKyZyhWUdjdI1cD/file.JPG)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/MlwUY2Ci1ek6OqrvFoKOaTubfkOShGJsdRdOwLKcBaTMHqVbJbgMNS1KCHDlYVsGe2vdcYYxbbyWpsjzM3M10k75yaxNyg0F/2.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/MlwUY2Ci1ek6OqrvFoKOaTubfkOShGJsdRdOwLKcBaTMHqVbJbgMNS1KCHDlYVsGe2vdcYYxbbyWpsjzM3M10k75yaxNyg0F/2.JPG)[](http://api.ning.com/files/1uifLWOMLze6J7j3Brl8vfXqqOsMdRbEXyUM334wKrZFyHTKFI4OOjXUw7RPI4-MznZcBpcDvxxylefLmXUrOSU2NPj8HU2l/file.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Misung Kwon", "created_at": "April 06, 2016 at 12:44AM", "created_by": "MisungKwon", "topic": "A problem/Ladybug_Sunlight Hours Analysis", "id": "topic_1501936"}
