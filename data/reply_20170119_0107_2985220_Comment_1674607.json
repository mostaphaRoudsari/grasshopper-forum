{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nusing setRadMaterials works fine but it would be great if the default values could be defined e.g. with an ini-file.

Not a big deal at all but nevertheless a possible source of error for the users.\n\nBest regards,\n\nHeiko\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Heiko W\u00f6hrle", "created_at": "January 19, 2017 at 01:07AM", "created_by": "HeikoWoehrle", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1672395", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1674607"}
