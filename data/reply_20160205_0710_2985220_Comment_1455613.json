{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for your advice! This should increase the efficiency of outdoor microclimate analysis significantly.\n\n\n\nYour example file works on my computer. So, I tested on my file attached here by specifying only the output variable related to surface outdoor temperature. However, I got the following warnings :\n\n**1. If you have connected a viewFactorMesh that includes regions on the indoors, you must connect up energy simulation data for zoneAirTemp, srfIndoorTemp, zoneAirFlowVol, zoneAirHeatGain, and zoneRelHumid.**\n\n\n\nI checked the workflow, and it seems to be the same as your (except those complicated geometry generation workflow). Appreciate if you can help to take a look and advise what I have missed here.\n\n\n\nThank you very much!\n\n\n\n**[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/46eV39TuMKiXwQmzcWQ*ezCO5h1TC00XFddq*1JrKP0gWP7Dn49HfSXqUEsmKL4Vo3nMzlCCdmOpq6wqcXIDY3Oa2DKPG97A/1.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/46eV39TuMKiXwQmzcWQ*ezCO5h1TC00XFddq*1JrKP0gWP7Dn49HfSXqUEsmKL4Vo3nMzlCCdmOpq6wqcXIDY3Oa2DKPG97A/1.PNG)**[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/46eV39TuMKjCQQGMVD3ieo0hewDLfM-6n6M*ixPgbe6QUTauScL1IJbZpBGXb9qycSkUEkqgQbFPSiMPhm00GBrmgkHajdIb/2.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/46eV39TuMKjCQQGMVD3ieo0hewDLfM-6n6M*ixPgbe6QUTauScL1IJbZpBGXb9qycSkUEkqgQbFPSiMPhm00GBrmgkHajdIb/2.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1455614", "name": "typology_v085_UTCI_simple_workflow_test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "February 05, 2016 at 07:10AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455452", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455613"}
