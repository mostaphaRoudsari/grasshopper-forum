{"body": "\nLudvig,\n\nYou are right that the previous version performed a bit different than the new one. Though the component was updated quite a few months ago.\n\nThe actual one, allows almost (if not all) the possibilities of shade definitions allowed in E+.\n\nSaying that, your file works fine with me AFTER i updated ALL components (with the updater). Notice that, depending which shading option you choose, the geometry produced here will or not be part of the E+ simulation. In any case you can see the shadeBreps output, that will give you the geometry you are asking for. If you want to use it in the simulation you have to use it as a context. Otherwise E+ will use a blind/shade object (not geometry).\n\nHope this makes clear things for you. If not ... ask again.\n\n-A.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/*R7YIBaka1uWEleRUHe-flVT7*EWvHgaM0TUKOketWLtDWARHn09Y5GrvfifbOjoKfT18XK4gHEsdkHHZ2fliZ8HxJdthEDi/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/*R7YIBaka1uWEleRUHe-flVT7*EWvHgaM0TUKOketWLtDWARHn09Y5GrvfifbOjoKfT18XK4gHEsdkHHZ2fliZ8HxJdthEDi/Capture.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 8, 2016 at 8:46am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1634572", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1635098"}
