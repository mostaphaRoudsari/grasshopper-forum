{"body": "\nThanks for finding the bug. I just added an issue to GitHub. I don't remember if I have changed the code for daylight modeling. Anyways, I won't be able to check this until later tonight or during the weekend. Feel free to send a PR if you get a chance to test it against a number of scenarios: 1. planar glazing. 2. Multiple planar glazing on the same surface. 3. Multiple non-planar glazing.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 23, 2017 at 5:50am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1698397", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1698563"}
