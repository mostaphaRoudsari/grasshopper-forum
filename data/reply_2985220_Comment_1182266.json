{"body": "\nHi Albert, Unfortunately I don't have a simple example. The ones that I put together were for office projects with dozen of zones, however if you can share a simple example I would be happy to set it up based on your file. It shouldn't take long. Also I want to capture some videos on tips and tricks for modeling with Honeybee and I never did. Maybe this one can get me started.\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 5, 2014 at 8:48pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1181794", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182266"}
