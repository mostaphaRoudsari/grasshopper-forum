If they are not this can (and will usually) cause chaos make sure your honeybee components are up to date by downloading them from user objects on github here:\u00a0[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/tree/master/userObjects](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/tree/master/userObjects)\n\n\n\n- Ive outlined how to set schedules and loads in the GH file\n\n\n\n- Don't use join to join your HB surfaces together you can simply put them into the Create Honeybee zone component\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n\nAnton\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1350840", "name": "LightingComfort_v5_testAJS 28.8.2015.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "August 28, 2015 at 2:24pm", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "topic_1349849", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1350839"}
