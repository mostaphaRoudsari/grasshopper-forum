{"body": "\nSarith,\n\nIt would quite cool to be able to get RGB values out of Daylight simulations in LB Tools. Is this something that could be possible in HB+? Or is it something very difficult to achieve within LB Tools?\n\n\n\nThis would make my ML studies interesting :)\n\n\n\nP.S.: An external Radiance script could work but if there isn't much hassle getting this information then I think not going outside HB is better.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 3, 2017 at 12:05am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1744543", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1744825"}
