{"body": "\nI have been running on an urban context. I have successfully generated a number of results on this scale. However, when I start to run the analysis on a number of the boundaries ( i have to extrude them to run as I ran into another \u00a0issue where I cannot run them as surfaces or meshes)...<br/> <br/> The latest issues is that a number of the outlines cause the daylight analysis to throw and error saying: \"solution exception: index out of range: 0\"\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/C*P8XcSSeqcbkqU6IY72S2AFfYefGHkjlN8wc2fhcvSkHYSsh1p-wbDQ*Uu8*HS3ZJ4N**K9q85y10S6BhsJr2d-HT-DqL9K/ladybugerror.JPG\" width=\"619\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/C*P8XcSSeqcbkqU6IY72S2AFfYefGHkjlN8wc2fhcvSkHYSsh1p-wbDQ*Uu8*HS3ZJ4N**K9q85y10S6BhsJr2d-HT-DqL9K/ladybugerror.JPG)<br/> <br/> It does happen for every curve ( have been able to isolate at least one group that does not cause the error). All curves are close, periodic and planar. Im working in meters and my min grid size is 10 meters (i know this is large but when you are working on a city it is not very big)...\n\n\n\nI have updated to the latest version so i know it is not a version issue. I've also tried reducing the grid size to 1 m.\n\n\n\nI've internalized a sample that does not work and a sample that does work. does anyone see anything i've missed?<br/> <br/> I've also reviewed similar posts but none of them seem to help:<br/> <br/> [http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/questions-f...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/questions-for-gridbasedanalysis-illuminanceanalysis-and-shading)<br/> <br/> [http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/daylight-an...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/daylight-analysis-index-out-of-range-frozen-stuck-cmd)<br/> <br/> <br/> The GH file with the internalized data is too large to upload here (88mb).
