{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nFirst of all a big thanks to Sarith for these amazing components!\n\n\n\nI have only played around them for a bit and they look amazing. It is actually incredible how much faster than Dialux it makes the electric lighting assessment process, especially since I can run a whole floor of HB zones at once.\n\n\n\nI had a small request though. I realize that we can probably do top down or perspective views quickly by selecting a dark sky and no roof in zones. But I was wondering if instead we could have a quick selection of a view inside a zone (much like dialux does when you make a room). I could do it manually but it is a bit time consuming especially when the number of zones increases. Furthermore, by allowing the zones to be simulated 'as is', the components are seamlessly integrated into my other workflows (e.g. energy models/definitions).\n\n\n\nI am not aware if there is an automatic view selection of a zone for the Rhino camera. And I am also not sure if small areas will fit well with Rhinos camera (perhaps a change in angle and zoom is needed there). Any ideas how this can be done?\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 05, 2016 at 06:59PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Electric Lighting Components - Automate view selection", "id": "topic_1455852"}
