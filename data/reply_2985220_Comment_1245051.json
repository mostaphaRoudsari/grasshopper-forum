{"body": "\nHi Rania,\n\nThe problem (or part of it) is that you didn't have updated components.\n\nSee attached, where almost everything is working (didn't test it, but they are not orange anymore). See two X marks (red and blue), where i updated the components. I left both the old and the new so you can see. Also HB_HB and LB_LB weren't last versions.\n\nAlso the EP_SetAirFlow wasn't updated correctly.\n\nIf some components don't work again, just Ctrl+B and Ctrl+E twice the HB_HB and LB_LB. Then pick the orange components that warn that you need to let the LB/HB fly first, and Ctrl+E them, also twice (disable/enable).\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1245052", "name": "New_Glazing_sys_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 18, 2015 at 10:39am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1244486", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1245051"}
