{"body": "\nTHanks for the reply,\n\n\n\nFor now, we use ladybugs own points for the ASE and then \"our\" generated points for the colored sDA map. The reason we use our own, is that then we have a mesh following it and because we're doing smooth isocurves in the final result, i need the points to be at corners of the mesh and not in the middle of the mesh faces (as ladybug does now).\n\nWe also added different features such as automatic naming per floor (and a RH script to group everything per floor in the end). I've attached a part of the script generating points. I will make a post about the entire script as soon as it's finished.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in the image, half of the numbers are displayed (too small and looks like points now), however they are in a regular grid.[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/GZs8qdvnOuE4jLR840gfo-YFzn-J-cBC*K0PCP7xrTg9-U2b7KVnKU8t8wC7yc7h29VlShETC*wN4kx3raIP5bmuVouayefs/screenshot_RH.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/GZs8qdvnOuE4jLR840gfo-YFzn-J-cBC*K0PCP7xrTg9-U2b7KVnKU8t8wC7yc7h29VlShETC*wN4kx3raIP5bmuVouayefs/screenshot_RH.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be super nice for the possibility to import just point + vector (+ a mesh if needed). For instance use the LB_grid.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1678732", "name": "HLA_Points_Generation_2017.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1678733", "name": "HLA_Points_Generation_2017.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mathias s n", "created_at": "January 26, 2017 at 01:23AM", "created_by": "Mathiassn", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1670536", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678731"}
