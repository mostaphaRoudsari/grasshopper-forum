{"body": "\nTo answer the first question, with whatever functionality is already is existing in Honeybee at the moment, the most straight-forward way to do this (in my opinion) would be to:\n\n1. do a simplified DGP calc based on ([http://ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2007/p231_final.pdf](http://ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2007/p231_final.pdf)) . To do this you'd have to do a single point vertical illuminance calc,\u00a0 which is very easy with Daysim. This result is valid only for those hours for which sun isn't directly visible in your field of view.\n\n2. Identify those hours for which sun is visible from your view point based on [sunlight hours calculations.](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Find_when_sun_is_visible_to_a_point&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n3. Run a glare calculation for those hours. You can probably pick one-in-three cases and cut down the time for calcs further.\n\n4. A more invasive method, described in ([https://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_0944_951.pdf](https://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_0944_951.pdf)), requires getting illuminance values from daysim and luminance-based values from evalglare. That will require some additional outputs to be added to the existing Honeybee_Glare Analysis component.\n\n\n\nClear all of this with your advisor first!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "February 27, 2017 at 10:21PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1702042", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701798"}
