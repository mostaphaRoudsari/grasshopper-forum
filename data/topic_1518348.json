{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI am doing DA analysis regarding multiple surfaces but the mesh results turned out to be that \" Length of the results [X] is not equal to the number of mesh faces [Y]\". I tried to flatten the mesh list and join them together. But it still had the same problem.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCan anyone help?\n\n\n\nThanks very much in advance!!!!!!\n\n\n\nAttached the gh.. The 3dm. file is too big I will try to compress it and upload later.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/HGcA*VF6WbpwHzog0C6Ps5yxrcWi0Iu23KXNz74ltupvpXFBQrgR5*NCufYTdYDECUzfZcDgQKC8rLf3MPY-leH*b*TUBdgg/Pic.png?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/HGcA*VF6WbpwHzog0C6Ps5yxrcWi0Iu23KXNz74ltupvpXFBQrgR5*NCufYTdYDECUzfZcDgQKC8rLf3MPY-leH*b*TUBdgg/Pic.png)\n\nFig 1: surface of interest\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1518347", "name": "DaylightAutonomySimulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Maria X", "created_at": "April 28, 2016 at 10:13am", "created_by": "MariaX", "topic": "Multiple Surfaces_DA Analysis_Mesh results problem", "id": "topic_1518348"}
