{"body": "\nHI Abraham\n\nThanks for giving it a shot. Unfortunately I can't see the graphs due to some error in Ladybug 3D chart:\u00a01. Solution exception:unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'. There is something wrong with the internalized data component. Maybe if you split the results to solar gains and temperature it will work. Another thing is that I don't know what you mean by fixed shading etc. I ran the script couple of times with / without buildings / with shading that covered both windows.\u00a0\n\nTotal solar gains for zone were as follows\n\nWith surrounding buildings: 1425 kWh\n\nWithout surrounding buildings: 1624 kWh\n\nWithout buildings, with HUGE shading 1324 kWh\n\nIf you look how the building is located regarding north, the gains, when turning on/off the buildings, should have completely different shapes and should occur in totally different hours. The surrounding buildings should cut down some of early hours gains, and all they do they cut down gains after midday, and a little in the early hours.\u00a0\n\nAs for the shading that I just ran, it should cut down almost all gains and it doesn't, take a look at the file.\n\n\n\nAntoni\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1480633", "name": "SHADING ROOM1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antoni Balcerzak", "created_at": "March 9, 2016 at 9:22am", "created_by": "AntoniBalcerzak", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1480716", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1480631"}
