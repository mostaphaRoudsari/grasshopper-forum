{"body": "\nHi there!\n\nIs it possible to make the legend face the camera like the sun position tags in your tutorial? That way it would be readable regardless of the current perspective...\n\nAlso I'd like to transform the psychrometric chart into a Mollier i,x diagram (just because I'm more used to it). Would that be hard to do?\n\nThanks in advance! :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Albert Pressler", "created_at": "January 15, 2015 at 04:10AM", "created_by": "AlbertPressler", "topic": "Legend facing Camera", "id": "topic_1204652"}
