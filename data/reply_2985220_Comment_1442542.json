{"body": "\nChris,\n\nI actually don't have any other bug to report but I'm going to use this tool quite often since now so I'll basically keep testing it more deeply and I'll eventually let you know, of course.\n\nI attach a GH file as required with 2 panels. The original one shows the bug while in the modified one I deleted the space between the words \"ALWAYS ON\" in the line 997 of the code. Basically the problem occurs when you set that the shade is always on.\n\nThank you, as always, for fixing these bugs!\n\nClaudio\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1442543", "name": "EnergyPlus_Window_Shade_Generator_CMmodif.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio Marini", "created_at": "January 20, 2016 at 10:21am", "created_by": "ClaudioMarini", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1440019", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1442542"}
