{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for your input. I realize that the level of detail at that point is just ridiculous and I wouldn't try to model at that level. However my case is a bit more challenging since the whole roof (an expanse of around 9000 m2) has a series of hundreds of small, circular windows (imagine a pattern with small circles with center at the points of a Delaunay mesh). To top that madness off there is an interior perforated screen pattern, misaligned (on purpose) with the circular skylights.\n\n\n\nThis is the situation I find myself in and I wondered if people had any experience or ideas on how to model. I think it's fair to say that at least in terms of solar calculations this internal mass will have an impact. If however the impact on the total thermal energy of the whole zone (this is a single zone I guess) is minimal I'm up for following the sane path of WWR for the skylights.\n\n\n\nI will test either options, if I can manage to make a few thousand windows run, and let everyone know.\n\n\n\nBtw, I love how this can be included in the comfort maps!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 02, 2016 at 10:11PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1521123", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1521217"}
