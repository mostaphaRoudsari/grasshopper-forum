{"body": "\nHi Carmen,\n\n\n\nThe error is \"not an octree\". If you search the group and online you will find an explanation for it. Take a look at this discussion as well: [http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/octree-erro...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/octree-erroe?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1269557&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\n\n\n\nAs for the error could be a number of things. Quality of your geometry, type of geometry, or geometry stretching outside radiance's bounding box around your geometry. Perhaps try including a ground plane that extends around your geometry or try expanding your test points outside your geometry?\n\n\n\nOr even better try what Mostapha is suggesting in the thread above :)\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 04:59AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1277438", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1277200"}
