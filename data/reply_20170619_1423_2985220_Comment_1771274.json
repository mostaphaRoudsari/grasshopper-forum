{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI have some large windows (double height volume space) facing west and are getting baked by radiation in the summer due to solar radiation. \u00a0Replacing glazing would be too expensive. \u00a0I am thinking of applying film. \u00a0I have seen some decorative/ frit like films. See link to one of the designs below. \u00a0But before making the decision to buy and install the film. \u00a0I am looking for Honeybee data to guide my decision.\n\nI am assuming this film has 50 % opacity (dot frit ratio). I plan to model the frit as a surface and run **both daylight and energy studies.**\n\nFor Daylight I am thinking couple of hourly studies with radiance should give me a good idea of the resulting reduction in illuminance and solar radiation. \u00a0I did not think of running an annual study but may be I will run one.\n\nFor the energy model I am not very sure hence the post on the forum. I was\u00a0thinking adding a brep (maybe using a HB context shading) and locating it in the same plane as the glass. Although I plan to apply the film on the inside of the window, I feel the effect would be as if the glazing and film are in plane. \u00a0Would this be a right assumption\n\nI did some shading studies with location of the brep. \u00a0I find that if brep is located outside the window I see huge reduction in cooling load. \u00a0if brep is located in-plane with the glazing, i see some reduction in cooling load. \u00a0if brep is located inside the glazing, i don't see any reduction in cooling load. Hence i am confused as all the film manufacturers say there will be significant reduction in cooling load. \u00a0Any advise would be helpful.\n\nThanks,\n\n[https://www.decorativefilm.com/3m-fasara-sh2fgim-illumina-50-high](https://www.decorativefilm.com/3m-fasara-sh2fgim-illumina-50-high)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ibby", "created_at": "June 19, 2017 at 02:23PM", "created_by": "Ibby", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1771529", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1771274"}
