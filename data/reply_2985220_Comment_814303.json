{"body": "\nThis is great advice, thanks guys! I wouldn't underestimate my imagination though :)<br/><br/>As stated in the OP I am performing the\u00a0initial\u00a0research (think\u00a0methodology, tools, when/why/how etc.) on how to inform the design of a static shading device system for school/office building typologies on the northern\u00a0hemisphere located in a consistently\u00a0hot climate with a high degree of radiation\u00a0all year (which I learned from the data extracted using the importEPW\u00a0file reader, hooray!).<br/><br/>Of course I am approaching the subject with the appropriate amount of respect and trying to inform myself as much as possible. Beyond papers (and Wikipedia!) I found several websites (like [this one by Autodesk](http://sustainabilityworkshop.autodesk.com/building-design-concepts)) which describe the basics of environmental building design concepts. If you have any good tips for papers/books/links this would be highly\u00a0appreciated\u00a0as well.<br/><br/>Perhaps boring was not the best adjective I could have used, but I suspect you got the gist of what of was saying. Consider both my thumbs up high as well.<br/><br/>Thanks again,<br/><br/>Anders\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anders Holden Deleuran", "created_at": "March 21, 2013 at 5:10am", "created_by": "AndersHoldenDeleuran", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_813637", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_814303"}
