{"body": "\nHi All!\n\n\n\nI am currently creating a file which will allow for a parametric simulation of a 2 storey building. I will be adding the myslider component to the parametric sliders once I have the file working. As is, I have a file which works to run a daylight simulation, create a lighting schedule and then use this to run an energy plus simulation (ParametricTest_Single).\n\n\n\nThe file is using custom made schedules and constructions for the NZ context (userCustomLibrary.idf)\n\n\n\nMy issue now is that I want to split the zones according to orientation (interior and perimeter), run daylight simulation for the grids within the individual zones, create a lighting schedule based on the DA result for each zone and then combine the zones again to run an energy simulation. However, I believe my workflow must be incorrect to do this, as I cannot get it to work. It simply comes up with a \"Solution exception: index out of range: 0\". This is in the Splitzones_issue file.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions? Much appreciated for any help!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1361910", "name": "SplitZones_Issue.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1361911", "name": "ParametricTest_Single.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1361912", "name": "userCustomEPLibrary.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "September 14, 2015 at 5:29pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Coupling Daylight and Energy Simulations - issues in splitting zones to create individual lighting schedules", "id": "topic_1361913"}
