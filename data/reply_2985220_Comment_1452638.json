{"body": "\nHmm it is strange because I feel that DF calculation involes firing equal luminance beams from all the sky into the model and calculating the lux levels inside. At least that's the impression I have. I don't see how time and date could be relevant as the above is quite time irrelevant in itself. Perhaps I am missing something or perhaps Dialux allows for Climate based simulations (which do get time and date as inputs) without naming them as such?\n\n\n\nI'm sorry I can't help more but I'm sure people much more knowledgable than me are on their way :)\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 2, 2016 at 2:36am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1452628", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1452638"}
