{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\n\nThanks for the prompt reply. I looked into the the CPU count. I am running 8 CPUs which hasn't been a problem in the past. However, I am also testing only 1 test point (for a quick turnaround). When this happens, the annual simulation does not work. When I changed the grid count to be greater than 8, the annual simulation ran.\n\n\n\nIt appears it does have something to do with exactly what you stated above. Let me know if that helps.\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nReinhardt\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reinhardt Swart", "created_at": "July 1, 2015 at 7:14am", "created_by": "ReinhardtSwart", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1318298", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1318718"}
