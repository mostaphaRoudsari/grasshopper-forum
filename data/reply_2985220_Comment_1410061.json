{"body": "\nHi Carl, This issue can have different reason. I wonder if this is similar to the other post yesterday that the component doesn't wait for the analysis to be over so when it checks for the results there is nothing to collect and it gives an error. Can you confirm that it will give you similar error on a different type of analysis (e.g. gridBased)? Also which version of Windows are you using?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 26, 2015 at 5:52am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1409791", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1410061"}
