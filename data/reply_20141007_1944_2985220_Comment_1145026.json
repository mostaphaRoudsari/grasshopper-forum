{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nYou are always a step ahead of our documentation and tutorial resources :)\n\nThe image Mostapha posted is how the blinds material is used currently. \u00a0The workflow is fully-functional right now such that you can model dynamic blinds but I didn't include it in the Honeybee Energy modeling series because I think that I will make a whole other series on shade that will cover everything from the shade designer to the solar fan/envelope to the shade benefit evaluators to the dynamic blinds and shades. \u00a0We have so much stuff dealing with shades that it seems to make sense to give them their own series.\n\nAlso, you are right that the Honeybee blinds material component diverges from the definition in the IDFEditor. \u00a0There are so many inputs for the blinds material in the IDF that Mostapha and I thought it was a good idea to separate it into two components. \u00a0Also, the second of the components in the image above makes it easy to visualize your shades as Rhino breps and understand the geometry of shades that you are inputting, which the IDF Blinds material does not really compute.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 07, 2014 at 07:44PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1144703", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1145026"}
