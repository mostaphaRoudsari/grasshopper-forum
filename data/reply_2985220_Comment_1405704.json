{"body": "\nHi Saurabh,\n\nThere is no good answer for this. If you search in Radiance mailing list you should [find Jan's answer to a similar question on Radiance's mailing list](http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010847.html):\n\n\"Be aware, that DGP is just a measure for discomfort\u00a0glare\u00a0INSIDE a building. It does not include disability\u00a0glare\u00a0and is also no measure for discomfort\u00a0glare\u00a0OUTSIDE\u00a0a building, where you have much higher adaptation levels.\"\n\n\n\nI would say a ray-tracing analysis can give you a good idea of potential issues but then how to calculate DGP values based on an image analysis is something that I can't really comment on.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 6:11pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1405857", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1405704"}
