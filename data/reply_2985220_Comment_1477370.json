{"body": "\nHi Antonello,\n\n\n\nLooks like some of the stuff that you're recently working on are very similar to what I have implemented in the new Ladybug library:\u00a0[https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/ladybug-core/blob/master/...](https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/ladybug-core/blob/master/tests/ladybug-test.py#L62-L67)\n\n\n\nOne the one hand, the new development will be behind the current plugins and it's great that you're adding these features that are really needed. One the other hand I'm worried that we are duplicating work. It might be a good idea to get you involved in the new development as soon as possible to avoid this issue however then it will take much longer for your development to be ready to use by everyone in Grasshopper... I'm just thinking loud here. Thanks for the great work.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 4, 2016 at 8:48am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1476989", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1477370"}
