{"body": "\nHi Atis,<br/><br/>You posted your second reply 2 minutes before I posted mine. Sorry for not seeing it, and not refreshing the page.<br/><br/>Yes, I assume that this is the problem: your epw file does not contain the separate directNormalRadiation and diffuseHorizontalRadiation. This is why you are always getting zero optimal tilt angle.<br/>Chris recently posted a\u00a0[link to other free epw files](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/EnergyPlus_Support/files/Meteonorm_Weather_Files/) not released by US department of energy. These are exported from [Meteonorm application](http://meteonorm.com).<br/>You can download the Riga epw file [from here](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/EnergyPlus_Support/files/Meteonorm_Weather_Files/Europe/Latvia%20%28LVA%29/).\n\n\n\nMeteonorm application additionally has weather data for 8325 locations around the world that can be export to .epw file. Sadly one needs to pay to activate this feature.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 04:18AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1330983", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1331089"}
