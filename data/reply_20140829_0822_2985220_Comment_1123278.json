{"body": "Hi Reinier,\n\nIs your complex input geometry mesh or Breps? Honeybee's default workflow is designed based on breps, which potentially provides a cleaner workflow and rad file and also let's you manipulate the geometry (e.g. add window to surface based on %).\n\nIf you input a crazy mesh it will first convert it to brep and then write it to. Rad files which will potentially take so long.\n\nIn case you have a mesh there is a mesh to rad component that should generate the Rad file in few seconds. You can use output files of this component and add them to the scene using additionalRadFiles input in runDaylight component.\n\nHope it helps. I don't have my laptop on me right now but I can send you an example on Wednesday if you couldn't figure it out on your own.\n\nMostapha", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 29, 2014 at 08:22AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1123351", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1123278"}
