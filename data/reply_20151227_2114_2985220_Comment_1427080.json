{"body": "\nMaria,\n\nThere is no problem at all with your model. If you see the whole south (from SE to SW) is free of obstructions. The lower mesh you get is telling you that your solar elements can be installed at those low heights without being affected by the surroundings. The default low value is -20 m, which is the lower mesh you get. You can input less than that (i did -50) and still get the possibility of having the solar collectors very low.\n\nIf you want to test what i'm saying just put some buildings at the south and you'll see that the solar collection mesh will rise. At an ideal situation you want it as lower as possible. In this way you are granted to receive sun at your plot, since the neighbors are not blocking it from you.\n\nAs for the solar envelope something similar but opposite is happening. Your context is pretty much away so you can build high. The default height is 50. You can give a higher number and you'll see that.\n\nHope this is clear.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 27, 2015 at 09:14PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1427135", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1427080"}
