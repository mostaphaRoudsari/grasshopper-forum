{"body": "\nHi everybody!\n\nFirst of all i would like to say thank you to Abraham, Chris and Mostapha for all the support and help you gave me till now.\n\nI am here again to ask help\u00a0for a daylight error i got during the simulation:\n\nAs you can see from the pictures below, two windows don\u00b4t seem to be counted in the dalight simulation, the daylight preview\u00a0shows them as they were opaque.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/17W2v0xf-z8B90JK5wgYyoRBMcGfram5UEC*EwR2LKrozJ5T*74SGYHxYyowAc2R6EhiLlPScGCW8xQzpD-aWj-lDV5FCaH3/1.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/17W2v0xf-z8B90JK5wgYyoRBMcGfram5UEC*EwR2LKrozJ5T*74SGYHxYyowAc2R6EhiLlPScGCW8xQzpD-aWj-lDV5FCaH3/1.jpg)\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/17W2v0xf-z*VrY9Flu3DuUvOw76MQzvdKN9sJCJvDft4EdPQOm-jDBp-hSkzubNHSHbt12-3XjuGM4rFb1okmKxxoyPyVhfp/2.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/17W2v0xf-z*VrY9Flu3DuUvOw76MQzvdKN9sJCJvDft4EdPQOm-jDBp-hSkzubNHSHbt12-3XjuGM4rFb1okmKxxoyPyVhfp/2.jpg)\n\nI\u00b4ve checked with the \"honeybee zone label surfaces\" component that they are radiance material and i\u00b4ve checked also that they are\u00a0planar (even if during the simulation i receive two warning:\n\n\"warning non planar vertex for polygon 2ca24ea4e41s41848s33_7_0\u00a0\"\n\n\"warning non planar vertex for polygon 2ca24ea4e41s41848s33_4_0\u00a0\" )\n\nAny advice??\n\nI have also checked if the problem was the normal of the windows but it\u00b4s not, because they are in the right sense.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1433318", "name": "Floor.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1433319", "name": "Floor.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "January 07, 2016 at 04:19AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Daylight Simulation Error/Warnings", "id": "topic_1433320"}
