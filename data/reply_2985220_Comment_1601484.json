{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\n\n\nYes, you should absolutely be changing the clothing with the seasons. \u00a0There is now an overwhelming amount of research, which shows that using the PMV model with a fixed clothing value typically results not only in increased building energy use but also greater occupant discomfort when applied to real-world cases. \u00a0In particular, there is usually greater discomfort in the summer because buildings are often over-cooled thanks to an assumption that many occupants are wearing more clothing than they actually are (such as a 3-piece suit or equivalent). \u00a0This may be a fair assumption for winter cases but even conditioned buildings with the strictest dress codes will usually have some variation in clothing from summer to winter that will merit some warmer summer temperatures.\n\n\n\nYou can use an expression like you have there but there is also a component called the \"Ladybug_Clothing Function\", which is made to help you generate an hourly list of clothing values based on the outdoor temperature. \u00a0The function comes from research published by the thermal comfort scientist\u00a0Stefano\u00a0Schiavon at the Berkeley Center for the Built environment. \u00a0I have also modified the function so that you can adjust the minimum and maximum clothing to suit different dress codes.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/RBh5pTSdbmu7wx2aQG0uFxJyVj2DUPi6nOJHf9yRqQ*K914C2x2f2-uhCd*6zEeyZWyifRfztTt5B*8ro3An-37eT6-81Vok/LadybugClothingFunction.JPG\" width=\"444\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/RBh5pTSdbmu7wx2aQG0uFxJyVj2DUPi6nOJHf9yRqQ*K914C2x2f2-uhCd*6zEeyZWyifRfztTt5B*8ro3An-37eT6-81Vok/LadybugClothingFunction.JPG)\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 18, 2016 at 12:51pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1601462", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1601484"}
