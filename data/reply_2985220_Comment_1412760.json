{"body": "\nI decided to take another way and finally i\u00b4ve got some results that look realistic. Anyway I have a question regarding natural ventilation component.\n\n\n\nAn importan parameter for natural ventilation calculation is the terrain type. I can see that ladybug has a componenet where terrain type is taken into account to develope wind profiles. Since EPW files are developed in open terrain i guess this assumption is taken by the simulation but i would like to change it and analysis how results vary.\u00a0\n\nQuestion: I would like to know how i can implement terrain type into energy calculations.\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nEduardo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Eduardo Artigas", "created_at": "December 1, 2015 at 1:42am", "created_by": "EduardoArtigas", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412680", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412760"}
