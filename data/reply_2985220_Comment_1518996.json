{"body": "\nHi Antonello,\u00a0\n\n\n\nAwesome! Just like to ask you a further question. Let's say we want to do Ladybug_solar envelope study for a site and we expect to know the volume generated on site will have no solar blocking impact on surrounding targeted buildings.\n\nSo far I can define an analysis period however they are not relevant to sunrise/sunset.\u00a0\n\nSince solar height near sunset/sunrise is very low and I intend to exclude them from the calculation. The criteria could be defined, for example 2hrs after sunrise and 2hrs before sunset.\n\n\n\nIs it possible a schedule with respect to such criteria could be generated and input into \"Ladybug_sun path\" so that the calculation of \"Ladybug_solar envelope\" will be dynamic and respect each day's sunrise/sunset hours?\u00a0\n\n\n\nYour feedback will be greatly appreciated!\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nCheney \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Cheney", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 2:03pm", "created_by": "Cheney", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1469337", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1518996"}
