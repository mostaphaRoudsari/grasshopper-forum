{"body": "\nDear bugs and bee,\n\n\n\nI understand that:\n\nthe \"**cooling loads**\" as reported on the **Read EP Results** component is actually calculated based on the output variable\n\n\"**Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Total Cooling Energy [J](Hourly)**\"\n\nwhich is the sum of\n\n\"**Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Sensible Cooling Energy [J](Hourly)**\"\n\nand\n\n\"**Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Latent Cooling Energy [J](Hourly)**\"\n\nin the .csv result file.\n\n\n\nHowever, I don't know what \"**Zone Ideal Loads Zone Total Cooling Energy [J](Hourly)**\" is as highlighted below in the csv file that is about 158kWh less than \"**Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Total Cooling Energy [J](Hourly)**\" ...\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/D4tgE4d4mNo26MRDChb1ht1IYG5M2RNX16ujbgyykZqZ6IvtI9G6qGH8DSUK6x8lUxCyom02-L8wOOsURBD8SNoJZ7QNI*F8/Capture.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/D4tgE4d4mNo26MRDChb1ht1IYG5M2RNX16ujbgyykZqZ6IvtI9G6qGH8DSUK6x8lUxCyom02-L8wOOsURBD8SNoJZ7QNI*F8/Capture.PNG)\n\nIs it true that:\n\n**Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Total Cooling Energy [J](Hourly)**\n\n**=**\n\n**<strong>Zone Ideal Loads Zone Total Cooling Energy [J](Hourly)**</strong>\n\n+\n\n**Zone Ideal Loads Outdoor Air Total Cooling Energy<br/>**\n\n... according to the following link: [http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/pa...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/page-032.html) ?**<br/>**\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/D4tgE4d4mNphjpwWUiGhvGG7dCiSbXwT2tV8CQT0zDq1JORASX19NNQ6TDjcMx8cMINbxch6R7Evwa1DvxsSpGK45bgIh19i/2.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/D4tgE4d4mNphjpwWUiGhvGG7dCiSbXwT2tV8CQT0zDq1JORASX19NNQ6TDjcMx8cMINbxch6R7Evwa1DvxsSpGK45bgIh19i/2.PNG)\n\nIf it is the case, then how come **Zone Ideal Loads Outdoor Air Total Cooling Energy** is not reported in the .csv result file?\n\n\n\nAnother question is:\n\nWhat is the output variable \"**Zone Ideal Loads Zone Total Heating Energy [J](Hourly)**\" as shown in the csv file image above? Why does it have non-zero values, because the simulation result is for a building with no heating needs as indicated by the zero value for the output variable \"**Zone Ideal Loads Supply Air Total Heating Energy [J](Hourly)**\"...?\n\n\n\nHope I explained clearly...\n\n\n\nLooking forward to your advice!\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "October 09, 2015 at 07:33AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "what is \"Zone Ideal Loads Zone Total Cooling Energy [J](Hourly)\"?", "id": "topic_1375974"}
