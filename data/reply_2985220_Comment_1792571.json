{"body": "\nHello Chris\n\n\n\nThanks for response. I finally got .csv data and edited them in Excel, but there are some issues with third-party weather data records (many records are missing, but they are working to fix it). The whole file is attached.\n\n\n\nLet's say I wanna evaluate that data with Ladybug. So the EPW file contains only one year data, right? What is the best idea to get some relevant data if I have hourly records from 2012 to 2017? My idea was to create an average of every hour of each year to have average year data.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1792573", "name": "Anse Rouge Weather Data.csv"}], "created_by_name": "Petr Vacek", "created_at": "August 2, 2017 at 2:56am", "created_by": "PetrVacek", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1779273", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1792571"}
