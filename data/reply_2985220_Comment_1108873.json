{"body": "\nHi Michal,\n\n\n\nThank you for reporting. Looks great and I like the visualization down there. pretty cool. I didn't understand your question 1.\n\n\n\nFor question 2, all the errors that I see here are coming from an update. Update userObjects and then replace the components with new ones from the tab and they will be solved.\n\n\n\nBack to error with GB looks like you are using old libraries. Copy attached files to c:\\gbxml and try again.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1108874", "name": "gbXMLSerializer.dll"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1108875", "name": "VectorMath.dll"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 30, 2014 at 7:18pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1108752", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1108873"}
