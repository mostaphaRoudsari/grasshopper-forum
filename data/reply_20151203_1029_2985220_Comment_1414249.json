{"body": "\nEduardo,\n\nI apologize for responding so late. \u00a0It seems that Mostapha has pointed you in the right direction and thank you, Mostapha, for being here in my absence.\n\nThe problem with 4 sets of outputs was not related to natural ventilation. \u00a0You connected the geometry of the Ladybug_North component to the north_ input of the run simulation component. \u00a0If you read the description of the _north input, it is supposed to be either a vector or a number representing the degrees to rotate the model. \u00a0It is not\u00a0the compass rose geometry that you get from the Ladybug_North Component.\n\nAlso, when setting up a hybrid nat vent and actively cooled building, you should leave a gap of a degree to two between the indoor temperature at which the windows close and the indoor temperature when the cooling system turns on. \u00a0Otherwise, you get the AC cooling the building to the point that the windows open and suddenly you loose all of the cool air in your space, forcing the AC to come back on 10 minutes later. Something like this would work a lot better:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2iuP6rjeNNJnJ1W7MQtuDwlHg-fI7puIn7Tw5qJrJjvw6iPgwbnmhZy7s1YHEInMbN4WIXR78XQU*4B3mCVe81Hrti7IKFbE/GoodNatVent.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2iuP6rjeNNJnJ1W7MQtuDwlHg-fI7puIn7Tw5qJrJjvw6iPgwbnmhZy7s1YHEInMbN4WIXR78XQU*4B3mCVe81Hrti7IKFbE/GoodNatVent.JPG)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 03, 2015 at 10:29AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1413070", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1414249"}
