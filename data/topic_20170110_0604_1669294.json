{"body": "\nHello,\n\nusing the component\u00a0Ladybug_Sunlight Hours Analysis there are two inputs:\n\n- geometry (Geometry for which sunlight hours analysis will be conducted)\n\n- context (Context geometry that could block sunlight to the test geometry)\n\nDuring some recent tests the results I get are very strange, it looks like the geometry objects are self-shading (i.e. I have a group of buildings surrounding two buildings if I analyse the two buildings separately the result is different than if I analyse the two buildings together). Is it like that? I always thought it was not and that if you wanted to use a \"geometry\" also as \"context\" you should have feed that in both inputs. Or something is changed in recent version of LB?\n\nThank you.\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "January 10, 2017 at 06:04AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "Ladybug_Sunlight Hours Analysis geometry self-shading?", "id": "topic_1669294"}
