{"body": "\nHi Mostapha\n\n\n\nThanks for your response. I do see C:\\ladybug on my computer.\n\nI feel that it is because of my OpenStudio or EnergyPlus because I can see daylighting results but not energy simulations.\n\nI read on other discussions that OpenStudio should be in C:|program files and since it automatically wants to be located on C:\\OpenStudio, I created a folder myself in C:\\program files and called it OpenStudio and saved the openstudio documents there while installing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn regards Eplus, I have had all versions including V-8.3 and V-8.5 before re-installing LB+HB. HB picks V-8.3 automatically. I don't know if that could be a problem too.\u00a0\n\nPlease help me to get these bugs fly again!\u00a0\n\nThanks\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "July 19, 2017 at 10:03AM", "created_by": "LillyGD", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1786033", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1785905"}
