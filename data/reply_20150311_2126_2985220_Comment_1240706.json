{"body": "\nHi Chenyang, I forwarded a couple of emails from EP discussions on modeling green roof to you. It would be great if you can share your final findings here. We may create a parametric Green Roof construction for Honeybee. Looks like there is also and example file in EnergyPlus example files for modeling Green roof.\n\n\n\nFor modeling a building with surfaces underground move your model to -z and Honeybee will assign ground as the boundary condition. Alternatively you can assign ground boundary condition to the surface manually.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ec4fSw8DDIxKIM6GHLkSPe92a8bYuGiiUnQMMewbEYcpwRSXos1-jUzGOL4XLk9szOKSUbyiASHMlVdkG27kwVmltysZDkXt/ground_boundaryCondition.png\" width=\"675\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ec4fSw8DDIxKIM6GHLkSPe92a8bYuGiiUnQMMewbEYcpwRSXos1-jUzGOL4XLk9szOKSUbyiASHMlVdkG27kwVmltysZDkXt/ground_boundaryCondition.png)\n\nHi Tasos, on that note, do you have an example of different layers of Green roof that you can share?\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 11, 2015 at 09:26PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240082", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240706"}
