{"body": "\nDimitrios,\n\nI am not sure if I understand the request. Do you mean that initial radiation should be calculated based on input Rhino geometry or should it somehow try to use the LiDar geometry data that mapDwell does? (Note that it is often difficult to obtain LiDar data outside the US and my experience has taught me that most governments outside the US are not very open with their GIS data).\n\nAlso, it is very difficult to know what the tax credits and cost of panel installation are since it varies a lot from location to location. \u00a0As I understand it these days, for every Watt of PV installed, around $0.80 is for manufacturing and somewhere between $2.20 and $3.20 is for shipping and installation. \u00a0\n\nIf you know of a good global database with good estimators of labor installation costs and tax credits, let us know and we can try to link to it but I feel that Mapdwell would probably be using such a database if it existed.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 11, 2015 at 2:35pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1222273", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1222677"}
