{"body": "\n... OK, I may have found the explanation:\n\nOn page 13 of ASHARE 55-2013, paragraph 5.4.2.4, it is indicated that if operative temperature is above 25 degrees, the upper limit of acceptable temperature is allowed to be increased, depending on the air speed as specified in Table 5.4.2.4, which can be as high as 2.2 degree.\n\n\n\nSo, I assume the height of the \"hump\" is about 2.2 degrees from the upper acceptability limit (80% or 90%).\n\n\n\nAppreciate your advice if the understanding here is not correct.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2Yrg*FGAb7yDlxUoH8JV8BpCeZXArZDFATOMj5pJgQAwRq6PFTKM80X7*qVPjgSAqciH73qMqcXVe3GCX59t9aS0WYCnoxfF/Image63.png\" width=\"480\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2Yrg*FGAb7yDlxUoH8JV8BpCeZXArZDFATOMj5pJgQAwRq6PFTKM80X7*qVPjgSAqciH73qMqcXVe3GCX59t9aS0WYCnoxfF/Image63.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "March 16, 2016 at 1:35am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "topic_1485694", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1485795"}
