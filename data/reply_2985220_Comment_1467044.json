{"body": "\nYes. Thank you for the suggestion. I was thinking along a similar line if it came down to it.\n\nHow would you suggest replacing the values to zero from a workflow perspective? It would be ideal to create a modify/replace routine within the GH environment. But I don't know how to achieve that working with the Ladybug components. Perhaps you do and can enlighten me.
