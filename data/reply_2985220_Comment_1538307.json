{"body": "\nOn shading: some application and devices would consider everything to be an opaque obstacle. Others might consider trees to be semi-opaque.<br/>In this case as we are using the **PV SWH System size** component to position our PVsurface rows, the glass panels are not shading the PVsurfaces beneath them. If they would have shaded them, we could have supply them to the **coniferousTrees_** input and set the **coniferousAllyearIndex_** input to the transmittance of glass panels (around 0.5 depending on the glass type). But as these are just assumptions, you can always put everything into the context_ input, except for the threes.<br/><br/>For literature: there are a number of\u00a0[papers](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=1EDDCB7DF0DE542B2C66F3B9CD914A7E?doi=10.1.1.651.5038&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) with detailed explanations on how shading affects a cell/module/array.<br/>Ladybug Photovoltaics components use a generalized shading approach where\u00a0[shading losses are integrated into other system losses](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62641.pdf#page=13) (that's what the DCtoACderateFactor_ input is for).<br/>You can read more about shading method [in here](http://solardat.uoregon.edu/download/Papers/UsingSunPathChartstoEstimatetheEffectofShadingonPVArrays.pdf).<br/>[This article](http://www.thesolarplanner.com/array_placement.html)\u00a0on PV shading is very useful. On three pages, it closely replicates the way Sunpath shading component is working.<br/><br/>If you have any other issue, let me know.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "May 29, 2016 at 5:05am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1538338", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1538307"}
