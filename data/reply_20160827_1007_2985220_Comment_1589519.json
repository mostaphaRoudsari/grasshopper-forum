{"body": "\nHi Ji,\n\n\n\nGlad to hear the simulation kept on working with the updated fvSchemes. I think it looks alright to be honest. Not converging is not really an issue because it does look converged to me at least for the quality of the mesh.\n\n\n\nActually, convergence is much more than simply having low residuals. You can have a wrong solution with very low residuals. Usually, it is a combined process of both run time information on residuals and having an idea or expectation of what the simulation results should be. Another way of assessing convergence is if the residual values have been stable (within a very small limit, e.g. 1E-5) for more than a certain number of iterations (e.g. 1000). We are planning to provide run-time residual plots in Butterfly, hopefully soon. These plots can help keeping an eye on the solution.\n\n\n\nYou could try as a test if you want to switch to a blend of first and second order (by swapping upwind with linearUpwind in the fvSchemes)\n\n.\u00a0\n\nConcerning mesh quality there are a number of ways, some of which are a bit advanced for this post and for BF's current\u00a0capabilities. The best way to start is by refining the background mesh (i.e. the blockMesh). You can do that by assigning more cells to the x, y and z directions in the blockMesh component. However, make sure you increase the max global cells. I would suggest you monitor the output of the blockMesh in order to know the total number of cells there. Your max global cells has to be higher than that for SHM to even work. I'd suggest 2x to start with. Ofc all that requires a bit of trial and error depending on the case at hand.\n\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "August 27, 2016 at 10:07AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1589370", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1589519"}
