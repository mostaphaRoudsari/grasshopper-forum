{"body": "\nThank you Mostapha! I have no Python - or any programming experience for that matter - but I think I understand what you are suggesting. I would have to manipulate the \"Run Radiance Analysis\" component\" or create a new component that manipulates the HDR file in a manner similar to the Glare Analysis component. Is this something you might consider adding to HB?
