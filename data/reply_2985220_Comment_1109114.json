{"body": "\nDrum-roll!!!!\n\nOk, so there is a bit of a difference. On average values, the results are very close (6% difference), on the extremes, not so much. It looks like on the lower extreme, ladybug and ecotect have a difference of about 30%. While on the upper extreme, the difference is only about 8%. It looks to me ecotect is more conservative on average and ladybug is picking up more values on the lower extreme... way more.\u00a0\n\nPlease be aware that I am running the ecotect radiation simulation using the \"fast calculation\" option. I am going to re-run without that checkmark and share results. But so far it takes very long time(many, many hours). I don't know if I have the patience.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo, I don't know what to do now.\u00a0\n\nCheers,\u00a0\n\nIlya\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1109115", "name": "final_results.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Ilya Bourim", "created_at": "July 31, 2014 at 3:27am", "created_by": "IlyaBourim", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1108808", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1109114"}
