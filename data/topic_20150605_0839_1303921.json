{"body": "\nHi all!\n\n\n\nI have three questions to my simulation model.\n\n\n\n1. createHBZone made a floor out of my ground floor. Internal floors and ceilings in my model are adiabatic. What can I do that HB accepts groundfloor as groundfloor?\n\n2. As I posted somewhere else this morning, here again: What's the right procedure to save E+materials into an *.idf so that created and (from library) chosen materials appear after HB's flying? Floors and Ceilings don't get E+materials from library...\n\n3. I don't get heating- and cooling loads out of my model. Can it be that point 1. is the reason for that?\n\n\n\nAll I'm talking about in the attached file is pinky.\n\n\n\nAttached you find the E+ Sim-Report and the *.gh file.\n\n\n\nT h a n k \u00a0 y o u \u00a0 very much in advance!\n\n\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1303919", "name": "E+REPORT.txt"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1303920", "name": "150608_VF_E+_reduced.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "June 05, 2015 at 08:39AM", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "topic": "E+MATERIALS can't find - E+SIM OUTPUT WITHOUT HEATING AND COOLING LOAD", "id": "topic_1303921"}
