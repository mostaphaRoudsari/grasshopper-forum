{"body": "\nHi Aaron,\n\nI have finished making a glass material component and you can see it implemented in the attached GH file. \u00a0This should allow you to make very customizable window constructions with different glass properties in different layers, etc. \u00a0You can also adjust the thickness of the air layer between the panes of glass to get better or worse insulation. \u00a0The only real limitation now is that you cannot yet put in gasses other than air between the glass. \u00a0I can try to build in this functionality if there is a lot of demand for it but, realistically, it seems many of the window manufacturers don't certify the lifetime of the exotic gases like Argon and Krypton beyond 20 years (due to inevitable leaking) so my initial reaction is to just stick to the air layers.\n\nIn any case, I also took the opportunity to re-write the descriptions for all of the material component inputs (including the units of the inputs) so this should hopefully make things easier in the future. \u00a0You can get these new material components by syncing with the github.\n\nLet me know if there are any other requests.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1155378", "name": "FurtherTesting3_CWM2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 24, 2014 at 6:10pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1155261", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1155377"}
