{"body": "\nI think you are getting an error because your material has 'strings' in it. I looked into the Honeybee source code and found this line:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 while counter &lt; len(materialProp):<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 counter += int(materialProp[counter]) + 1\n\nThe int(materialProp[counter]) requires that the materialProp[counter] be a number. Simple radiance materials are usually of the format ... void plastic box 0 0 5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.1 . So everything after the 'box' is a number and the code works fine.\n\n\n\nIf you have a complex materials with terms like 'grand_dx' 'gran_dy' etc, the Honeybee code will crash as it tries to convert text to numbers. However, I think there should be a workaround. Can you share the gh file for your project ?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 28, 2015 at 1:06pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1296938", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1297504"}
