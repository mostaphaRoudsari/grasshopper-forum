{"body": "\nJulian,\n\n\n\nThanks for posting. \u00a0I am thinking that I will change the default values of this component as I am realizing that almost everyone sets up the component incorrectly the first time that they try it. \u00a0I have opened an issue here and I will make these changes to the defaults soon:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/547](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/547)\n\n\n\nFor your case, you have only one window on one side of your building and so you do not get any wind-driven cross ventilation (only buoyancy-driven stack ventilation from that one window). \u00a0So you need to set the wind discharge coefficient to 0. \u00a0The correct way to set up your model for your case is like so:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vtm5j-VOdSnJr*cJIcrXDshoaI3Qkg0yjlObMYUCxUjKYRifOcVljScz4N*75wnebyIAMGyKC0ci5aI8JOGobeZGwsh1rozA/CorrectAirflow.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vtm5j-VOdSnJr*cJIcrXDshoaI3Qkg0yjlObMYUCxUjKYRifOcVljScz4N*75wnebyIAMGyKC0ci5aI8JOGobeZGwsh1rozA/CorrectAirflow.JPG)\n\n\n\nAs you will see in the attached file, you get much lower airflows this way.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1596639", "name": "airflowing_kahlschlag_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 9, 2016 at 2:06pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1596577", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1596637"}
