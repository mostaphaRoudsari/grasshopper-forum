These types are based on gbxml, which I believe OpenStudio intrinsically understands (because of its export capability to gbxml).\n\nIf you have not already done so, you should go through all of the video tutorials on Honeybee energy simulation:\nHoneybee Energy Modeling: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YX...\nThe Label zones and Label Zone Surface components will also be very helpful for understanding the underlying variables that HB assigns.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 25, 2015 at 12:22PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1385656", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1385838"}
