{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nI am happy to announce that, with the aid of Mostapha and his infinite python wisdom, we found the error that was causing the parallel run to fail. \u00a0Some threads of the parallel run were calling certain properties from a class at the same time that other threads were changing those properties. \u00a0It's a parallel pitfall commonly called a \"race condition\" or the \"writing to shared memory\" ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997392](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997392)(v=vs.110).aspx).\n\nNeedless to say, the parallel capability is now fixed in the component on the github and in the attached file. \u00a0I also put in another check to have the component not run calculations related to direct sunlight if the zone has no windows. \u00a0All of this has gotten the annual run of your test box down to a whopping 35 seconds!\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/741FtnVWixblgr00dh*Ohc*R2tQXhR*ptY8jIOrjxWtKBWT9jViitDwpadpYYqxc0ALNI81pK-zpFdQM1XeXfH*NrbNj6Cnb/SuperfastAnnualRun.PNG\" width=\"639\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/741FtnVWixblgr00dh*Ohc*R2tQXhR*ptY8jIOrjxWtKBWT9jViitDwpadpYYqxc0ALNI81pK-zpFdQM1XeXfH*NrbNj6Cnb/SuperfastAnnualRun.PNG)\n\nEnjoy and thanks again goes to Mostapha,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1221510", "name": "IndoorComfort_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 9, 2015 at 9:25pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1221192", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1221209"}
