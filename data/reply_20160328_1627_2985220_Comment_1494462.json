{"body": "\nHi Grasshope\n\n<br/>I tested your file. You used Honeybee_SplitBuildingMass nJAN_26_2016 in your workflow. If you try to use the latest version of it you'll see that the error message disappears, because there are two new lines inside the code that let you deal this issue.\u00a0However, the results for that type of geometry will be something like this:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/S49Nelh6z7Pyw88ipyw*yyWK**VOJOeyUyV1ag4mAOqnKTS-8lcOrXTdHZJCOknTwgb6o0nU4JTDFG-I3J-KZv7xff4pwEWI/ERROR_breps.png?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/S49Nelh6z7Pyw88ipyw*yyWK**VOJOeyUyV1ag4mAOqnKTS-8lcOrXTdHZJCOknTwgb6o0nU4JTDFG-I3J-KZv7xff4pwEWI/ERROR_breps.png)\n\nI think the issue is because of some curves in crvList.. and to solve it you have to play around the start number as Michael told you.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, If you want, you can try the attached file where there is a method which should be fine for both geometries in your file: with holes or not.\n\nThe principle is to set the first number of the series component to half of height of floor (e.g. floor = 3 meters \u00a0 =&gt; \u00a0 start = 1.5 meters) and you can create a piece of workflow to do this operation automatically.\n\n\n\nBest\n\nAntonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "March 28, 2016 at 04:27PM", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1493471", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1494462"}
