{"body": "\nHi everybody,\u00a0\n\nI'm doing a project about optimizing a house and I did some simulations in order to set the optimum glaze ratio and orientations of the house in order to have the minimum energy consumption (heating+light). Now I was trying to see how the construction materials have influence on those outputs, and I was wondering what is the pre-set material of a Madrise Apartement Zone, because when I put some isolation materials as walls, then the heating consumption increases instead of decreasing. Here I upload the file.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1533965", "name": "Modelisation house optimisation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Axel Horsemean", "created_at": "May 20, 2016 at 07:04AM", "created_by": "AxelHorsemean", "topic": "URGENT.
