{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nIt will be true to say that what you wrote will work ONLY with schedule files (and maybe compact schedules) and that the pointer in the\"userCustomLibrary\" will be to such files?\n\nThe reason i'm asking is that usually schedules in E+ are linked one to another (Yearly, weekly, daily/ hourly).
