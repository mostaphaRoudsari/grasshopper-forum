{"body": "\nHi Melissa,\n\nRight now you are trying to deal with the shading part of your problem, right (assume that because so far no daylight requirements were mentioned).\n\nWhat i would do is taking 2-3 critical dates (i.e. 21.12, 21.6, 21.4/9), give the range of hours i want to check the shade and probably average the results to get the area in shade/exposed. I'm not convinced the number of hours you mentioned will give you what you want, unless you do the average i just wrote.\n\nHope this is clear enough ... if no, let me know.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 6, 2017 at 10:23pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1706716", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1706684"}
