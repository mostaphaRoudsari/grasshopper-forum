{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nif you set the distToGlass to 0.34 it will run. As you pointed in the file, this distance must NOT be smaller than half of the blind depth. But it doesn't mean that half a distance will work. Specially with inclined walls. Can't explain why (didn't enter into the depth of this), but this is the situation.\n\nInteresting that after setting this minimal distance the material issue dissapeared.\n\nSee attached: From your geometry you are getting weird artifacts in one wall, causing very narrow and triangular windows with very thin shades. I would fix the original geometry.\n\nProbably Chris will explain the triangles in te facade. Of course it is related to the geometry of the walls.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/dm99ly9wi66Gc6G5Req-Eg2hF*0GFWI1cVJ9S8TgswipUIOsQN-WIxVA4YVJT0u5aRICzNoLxiD-fIxUl8b3avCE5U0sh72o/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/dm99ly9wi66Gc6G5Req-Eg2hF*0GFWI1cVJ9S8TgswipUIOsQN-WIxVA4YVJT0u5aRICzNoLxiD-fIxUl8b3avCE5U0sh72o/Capture.JPG)\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 24, 2015 at 01:32AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1347873", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1347889"}
