{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nI checked and the warehouse schedules are not being used at all even though they are being written (so that is not it). Much of the differences in the way the schedules are written seems to do with the fact that OS does not support CSV schedules and so we have to write these in after IDF translation. \u00a0I'm trying to test your GH file but I'm getting errors from the simulation:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AxtJ5-qvacZR1nEyH542fBc2EXAYodhqXeEy4oNmFtag0tqqRKwWinLZDk-xxprJ4*ccqtikEAUt-UssWC-DUKKA7ta41wTL/OSError.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AxtJ5-qvacZR1nEyH542fBc2EXAYodhqXeEy4oNmFtag0tqqRKwWinLZDk-xxprJ4*ccqtikEAUt-UssWC-DUKKA7ta41wTL/OSError.jpg)\n\nThis really seems to be too complex of a model for me to separate honeybee code issues from the energy modeling issues.\n\n\n\nThe best I can offer if you are able to run your model on your machine without errors is to try producing [an energy balance graphic](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Energy_Balance&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)of the two models and see if there is one specific term that is out of order. \u00a0This will at least give us a place to start looking.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 9, 2016 at 9:14pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1614190", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1614894"}
