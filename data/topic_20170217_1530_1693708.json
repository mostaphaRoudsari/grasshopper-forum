{"body": "\nDear LB-HB Community,<br/> <br/> Currently I am working on a base case model for my study. I am confused about a situation here. The model that I am working on is a South oriented, 5X5X3m office room with some assumptions that you can see at the attached image. For now, the space is not conditioned. I doubt about the interior temperature. Is there something wrong about my definition? Or is it normal because of the excessive glazing. I will further study the influence of shading geometry on thermal and visual comfort.<br/> <br/> Your comments are more than welcome. <br/> <br/> Best regards,<br/> Mustafa\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/JomcnL50vYDmWspCYBpnPa1kyNmALLayiDmWkqsBiKPBBgGO7JF5*bop0B33T3q1RVFiYkIYAbB9KY63TBGhHBWAI8QbOQjr/Analysis_0.jpg?width=400\" width=\"400\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/JomcnL50vYDmWspCYBpnPa1kyNmALLayiDmWkqsBiKPBBgGO7JF5*bop0B33T3q1RVFiYkIYAbB9KY63TBGhHBWAI8QbOQjr/Analysis_0.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1693706", "name": "The Case_0.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1694160", "name": "Window_Picture_Spec.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Mustafa Teksoy", "created_at": "February 17, 2017 at 03:30PM", "created_by": "MustafaTeksoy", "topic": "Inside temperature of a box model", "id": "topic_1693708"}
