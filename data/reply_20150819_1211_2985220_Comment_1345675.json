{"body": "\nHi Jennifer,\n\n\"To fix them we have to disable and reactivate or even replaced various items and let the HB and LB fly again and again.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis happens because of the order of inserting components in Grasshopper. The easy fix is to select Ladybug component, and Honeybee component separately and press ctrl+B which will send the components back in the order and they will be executed first when you open the file.\n\n\n\nThe result of an annual cumulative irradiation study is not always consistent when performed with LBHB but is credible when performed with Diva on the very same Grasshopper file.\n\nTo trigger the bug just change the value of one of the inputs without set the HB toggle to \"False\" but leaving it on \"True\"\n\nWe noticed that when the bug happens the simulation in radiance is really quick.If the toggle on the HB simulation is switched\u00a0 \"False\" and then switched \"True\" again the simulation produces meaningful results.\n\n\n\nIt sounds like when you trigger the analysis it doesn't run the first time. It's not normal and I haven't experienced this before. Other users can comment on this. I you upload the file more people can test your file.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 19, 2015 at 12:11PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1345767", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1345675"}
