{"body": "\nHi Guus,\n\n\n\nI would run the comparison between Ladybug and Honeybee (Radiance) and not EnergyPlus. EnergyPlus sky model is simplified and is not the best reference for comparison. Claudio did a validation study while ago ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/data-reliab...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/data-reliability?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1046187&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)).\n\n\n\nAlso back to radiation from west in the early morning, it is possible in case the sky is diffuse. You can use watchTheSky component in Honeybee or Ladybug_SkyDome to see what exactly is happening each hour in case of radiation distribution in the sky.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 14, 2015 at 09:39PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1339713", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1343376"}
