{"body": "\nGreetings LB+HB Community!\n\n\n\nI write to start a discussion about the future LB+HB wiki. \u00a0Please post here any suggested features that you might want for the wiki and any good examples of other wikis that you think we should follow. \u00a0The list so far of these two things are:\n\n\n\nFeatures of the LB+HB Wiki:\n\n1. Includes all component descriptions as well as component input + output descriptions.\n\n2. Pictures to go along with the component descriptions above.\n\n3. Ability to search for keywords across all LB+HB components.\n\n4. Include the links to example files that feature each component.\n\n5. Include the links to Youtube videos that feature each component.\n\n6. Include links to referenced scientific papers used to make components.\n\n7. Allow users to upload teaching resources or post links of their own youtube videos.\n\n8. (Developer Wish) Make a component that can easily check all components and update the wiki.\n\n\n\nPotential Models to Follow:\n\n1. Build our own html pages from the ground up (probably creating something like the rhinocommon documentation\u00a0[http://4.rhino3d.com/5/rhinocommon/index.aspx](http://4.rhino3d.com/5/rhinocommon/index.aspx))\n\n2. Make a Wiki next to our code on Github like the Dynamo Wiki ([https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki)).\n\n3. Create a sleek-looking but potentially difficult-to-update wiki from a template like the Blender Wiki ([http://wiki.blender.org/](http://wiki.blender.org/)).\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease post any features we're forgetting or wikis you like. \u00a0Suggestions from people who have created wikis before would be EXTREMELY helpful. \u00a0We're going to try to put this wiki together sometime this year so post now or forever hold your peace!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 6, 2014 at 4:54pm", "created_by": "chris", "topic": "Ladybug + Honeybee Wiki", "id": "topic_1098315"}
