{"body": "\nTim and All,\n\nI apologize for the late reply. \u00a0The bug has been fixed and you can get a working component by syncing with the github or in the attached file.\n\nTim, also in the attached file, I show you how to use the native grasshopper move component to move the legend. \u00a0In your picture that you shared, you were only moving the legend point and not the legend itself.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1385561", "name": "16_AdvancedWindAnalysis_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 25, 2015 at 8:11am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1385176", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1385559"}
