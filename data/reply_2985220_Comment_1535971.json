{"body": "\nHi Anton. I can't see the image but I think I know which two components are you talking about.\n\n\n\nMostapha in your mind what is the difference between the two? Why did you use gendaymtx for the ladybug solar analysis but genCumSky for the Honeybee irradiance studies?\n\n**Gendaymtx is a newer development and is part of radiance. GenCumSky is developed for Daysim and is older. We will remove genCumSky eventually and will use gendaymtx for both ladybug and honeybee.**\n\n\n\nIs it possible to use gendaymtx for interior irradiance studies (with windows)? I assume that you can since it is actually producing a Radiance scene.\n\n**Yes. You can use both of them to generate the sky for radiance's scene. Using gendaymtx needs a little bit more work.
