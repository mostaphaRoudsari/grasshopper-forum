{"body": "\nHello Sarith,\n\n\n\nI understand that the Raytracing component is geometrical and just calculates the ray based on incidence angle = reflection angle rule. And that's why Mostapha suggested using the Bounce components since i am able to differentiate which is the reflective specular surface and which is the opaque surface that i do not want to reflect the light ray. However that does not seem to work. My end goal is visualizing which rays (at different times) are going to be reflected by the mirror surface, and which are going to be blocked from reaching the mirror thanks to the opaque sticks.\u00a0\n\nThat doesnt seem to happen, all rays look like they are reflected and a wierd wiggle happens where the ray is broken but it doesnt touch any of the surfaces. please check my attachements in the previous reply\n\n(and yes i understand that in reality there are no sharp rays and that this is just a geometric modelisation of a physical reality....but that is not the point here)\n\n\n\nThank you for your time\n\nGabriella\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Gabriella Rossi", "created_at": "April 21, 2017 at 11:18am", "created_by": "GabriellaRossi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1737234", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1737154"}
