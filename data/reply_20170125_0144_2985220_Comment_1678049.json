{"body": "\n2. I am also in complete agreement with\u00a0[Aurelien Keller](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topic/listForContributor?user=2qf6nk6hn4h1o)\u00a0about his comment on descriptions. This is necessary, and I am too working towards improving tool tip descriptions and component descriptions as and when I spot the ones that I think could be improved.\n\nWhat I really like\u00a0is adding what decision the component can help you take in addition what it can help you simulate. Obviously, I draw inspiration from components written by Chris and Sarith.\u00a0Technical notes, suggested practices, and warnings provided by Sarith\u00a0are much appreciated.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "January 25, 2017 at 01:44AM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1677954", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678049"}
