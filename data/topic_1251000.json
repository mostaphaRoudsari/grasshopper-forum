{"body": "\nIs it possible to create a series of named views in Rhino from Grasshopper?\u00a0\n\nI am trying to automatize a DGP annual simulation from given grid points but I cannot think of a way to do this only using grasshopper. The \"Daysim parameters\" needs to be fed a rhino view name. It would be great if I could create and name the views automatically from grasshopper.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"272\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UQSvRDwuxJLjOX-g2oLA8t5q*uNneR7qzHTpP6LrAb9-QG7N4BX3sZDsqkhbF2i4S1RqNBQt5kRhyA3byrxQFlmEJvi5ugkp/Capture.PNG?width=750\" width=\"642\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UQSvRDwuxJLjOX-g2oLA8t5q*uNneR7qzHTpP6LrAb9-QG7N4BX3sZDsqkhbF2i4S1RqNBQt5kRhyA3byrxQFlmEJvi5ugkp/Capture.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "March 27, 2015 at 3:52am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Automatically create named Rhino views from Grasshopper", "id": "topic_1251000"}
