{"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\nThanks for the suggestion link, it really helpful. \u00a0however, I still can't get rid of warning the non-convex surface from E+ Run Energy Simulation. \u00a0Yes now I can still read simulation result, yet warning seem disturbing me.\n\n\n\nAs I continue my exercise to daylighting simulation it gave me error as follow:\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/gnh1ndzD4NxkHGfQy8YapcjLC3Y4-Z3sE2601tQUdcphpjKlPr4PXhWVHLR4tYoidG83p9Q-JDPXhldMj5czel5o2y2l*jXo/daylighterror.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/gnh1ndzD4NxkHGfQy8YapcjLC3Y4-Z3sE2601tQUdcphpjKlPr4PXhWVHLR4tYoidG83p9Q-JDPXhldMj5czel5o2y2l*jXo/daylighterror.png)\n\n\n\nAs I continue further for Indoor View Factor Calculator it gave me Null result and warning as follow:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/gnh1ndzD4NxJCfH3Sb-j52wn3lCN3rZy8G3Q*5G7lisHoDygz4wi1LeGSd2O-ys0BAWJsfD60BoVAvJv9l4ZuY0j1N68M74U/indoorviewfactorcalclatorerror.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/gnh1ndzD4NxJCfH3Sb-j52wn3lCN3rZy8G3Q*5G7lisHoDygz4wi1LeGSd2O-ys0BAWJsfD60BoVAvJv9l4ZuY0j1N68M74U/indoorviewfactorcalclatorerror.png)\n\n\n\nDo you have any further suggestion how I could solve the problems? \u00a0Also please find an attachment of my update energy model.\n\n\n\nAtta\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1569694", "name": "ENERGY MODEL.gh"}], "created_by_name": "atthaillah b", "created_at": "July 22, 2016 at 01:55AM", "created_by": "atthaillahb", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1569639", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1569692"}
