{"body": "\nEverybody has pretty much made the point already but I just wanted to add that the LCCAs that we do in my office typically take a month or so to assemble primarily because we need a cost estimator to make an inference about the initial cost of materials and labor of construction. \u00a0These quantities vary substantially across different locations and time periods so I would not trust any source that argues for one universal cost value of given material for all projects. \u00a0I will say that quantifying energy cost savings is pretty straightforward with Honeybee and you can see an example here:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Calculate_Annual_Utility_Bill)\n\nHowever, cost of construction is tough to quantify, which is why there's a whole profession devoted to just that.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 12, 2017 at 6:08am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1795738", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1797620"}
