{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nthanks a lot for your answer!\n\nI think I set it up incorrectly because actually I do want have two windows facing east and west respectively though the window facing west is more than twice as big as the one facing east (I hope this is not critical yet). I updated again, now it says so in the ReadMe and I got volumes between like 3-17m3/s again.\n\nAt this point I just stopped and calculated: Is it possible, that an airflow volume of 3-17m3/s in this case is not so unrealistic after all? It would mean, in the most extrem case, bit more 21km/h wind speed at the opening.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it possible that I just misestimated the values to expect?\n\nYou might guessed it: I'm still architecture student. : /\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1597106", "name": "airflowing_kahlschlag.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Julian Trummer", "created_at": "September 11, 2016 at 4:43am", "created_by": "JulianTrummer", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1596637", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1597104"}
