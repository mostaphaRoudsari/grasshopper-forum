{"body": "\nthanks, Abraham and Mostapha!\n\n\n\nSo, the workflow should always be the following?\n\n1- create building masses representing different zones\n\n2- intersect building masses by splitting overlapping surfaces\n\n3- convert building masses (with overlapping surfaces identified) to HB zones\n\n4- solve adjacency between HB zones\n\n- ...\n\n\n\nSo, what if i need to add a window to a particular wall surface?\n\n\n\nDo I need to single out the HB zone containing that wall surface after step 4 above, decompose the zone, add window to the wall surface, and then assemble the HB zone using the **createHBZones** component ... ?\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "June 23, 2015 at 7:24am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1322735", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1314194"}
