{"body": "\nChris - that's super useful to see your flow, thanks! I like the MakeItAPlenum component, and I hadn't yet tried out the natural ventilation model interface, but it looks like you've developed it into utter straightforwardness so I'll give a try.\n\nI think my difficulties were in the geometry-matching. After my question, I went forward with grinding out the geometry by hand, which worked. But just now writing this I'm remembering your _IntersectMasses tool, which would subdivide the roof (poly)surface where my DS masses match to it. I had neglected to do that, so the smaller zone-lets that I setup to be the DS's weren't correctly mated to the real zone. So, so far I have been able to model the whole roof as a DS, but I couldn't model smaller \"skylight-style\" glazed components that didn't cover the whole roof surface.\u00a0\n\nOn a lightly related note (so maybe this deserves a new thread) is there a reason the BlockBeamSolar control option for the E+ blinds object isn't exposed by the HB EPWindowShades component? I like how you generate schedules from the climate data; I haven't tried the CSV schedules through OS yet, but I believe you that it's working now, and I see that with a little math one could write the BBS angles schedule easily enough.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Novelli", "created_at": "August 9, 2016 at 7:22am", "created_by": "NickNovelli", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1577571", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579066"}
