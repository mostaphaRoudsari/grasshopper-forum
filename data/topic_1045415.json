{"body": "\nHello everybody,\n\n\n\nI encountered an annoying problem with glazing.\n\nI want to use the component Add Glazing in order to define all the glazed surface by myself (and not based on ratio). I succeeded in defining :\u00a0\n\n- HB surface (which is the surface on which the window is situated)\n\n- childsurfaces (the glazed surface)\n\n\n\nBut I don't know what's next. Could you help me solving this problem ?\n\nIf you have any better ideas to define the Glazing, don't hesitate !\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your answers !\n\n\n\nCheers\n\nR\u00e9da\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Radis", "created_at": "April 16, 2014 at 7:42am", "created_by": "Oussennan", "topic": "Add Glazing", "id": "topic_1045415"}
