{"body": "\nBo,\n\nIt's relatively quick once we establish all of the things that we want to change on the other VAV system templates.\u00a0 Still, we really need to decide on this first as we would likely have to go back and re-do the implementation of system 8 if we decide that we want to add/remove other features.\u00a0 I feel that, right now, there's been such a prioritizing on allowing people to size the HVAC elements in GH and not enough on adding/removing key elements to the system like heat recovery, humidity control, filters on the fan or just allowing people to set a fraction of recirculated air (recirc air only works for system 7 right now).\u00a0 Personally, I feel that most people are going to want the system autosized and we don't need to have component inputs for these.\u00a0 All of these sizing inputs really just distract users from applying the things that they really want to test and they also make a nightmare for software development (this really seems to be the major reason why the implementation of the systems is not finished yet).\u00a0 Rather than focusing on sizing parameters, we should focus on the key elements of the HVAC that people want to add/remove and they can always change the parameters of these elements in the OpenStudio interface.\n\nWe can discuss this more when we talk on Thursday.\u00a0 If you want to prepare for it, having a short list of the most important features would be helpful.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 22, 2016 at 7:40am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1513917", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1513925"}
