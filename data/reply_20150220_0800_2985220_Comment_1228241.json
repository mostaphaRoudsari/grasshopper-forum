{"body": "\nHi Chris, Cesar,\n\n\n\nI was wondering how I could model a zone with ideal air load parameters for heating during winter and natural ventilation during summer. Should I set my coolingcapacity to 0 and the connect my zones to the natural ventilation component?\u00a0\n\n\n\nHave you tried something similar? Also do the nat ventilation component allow to apply to interconnected zones? or is for a simple zone only?\n\n\n\nThanks!\u00a0\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1228243", "name": "Screen Shot 2015-02-20 at 15.58.10.png"}], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 20, 2015 at 08:00AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1219283", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228241"}
