{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nI know what you are saying, but my heating design day is plugged - you can see it in the picture above.\n\nIt is plugged a schedule with 0\u00b0C from midnight to 8.00, 20\u00b0C from 8.00 to 19.00 and 0\u00b0C from 19.00 to midnight.\n\nThis means for me that the system should work only during the day (from 8.00 to 19.00). I put 0\u00b0C to simulate the unoccupied hours.\n\n\n\nIf you check my file attached you can see it still doesn't work.\n\n\n\nMoreover:\n\n- if we detach all the schedules (bypassing the schedule command), we still obtain the same issues - only cooling loads\n\n- we have tried to compare this situation with other commercial software to validate this script, but at the moment the results are not aligned\n\n\n\nI think this is an important task to solve in order to define a realistic and reliable relationship between parametric design and HVAC design.\n\n\n\nCould you please check the file attached for any mistake we made (maybe in other part of the script)?\n\n\n\nRiccardo\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1657728", "name": "Thermalloads_FORUM2bis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Riccardo Diaferia", "created_at": "December 14, 2016 at 6:44am", "created_by": "RiccardoDiaferia49", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1654062", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1657727"}
