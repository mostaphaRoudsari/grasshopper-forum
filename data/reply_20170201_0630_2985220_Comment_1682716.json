{"body": "Agnes,\nUnfortunately, Energyplus's electrochromic glass object does not allow for 4-state shading setpoints. There are a ton of control strategies for 2-state setpoints and the \"Target illuminance Setpoint\" control strategy allows for continuous multi-step setpoints. However, E+ team has not implemented 4-state setpoints (I think because you will usually get pretty comparable energy use with the 2-state vs 4-state strategy). If you absolutely need to model 4-state controls, there is a way to use a program that can edit the simulation as E+ is running. It takes a lot of time to set up but I will see if I can find a link.\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 01, 2017 at 06:30AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1681347", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1682716"}
