{"body": "\nAtaur,\n\nJust to clarify, do you mean the Koppen Climate zone? \u00a0If so, keep in mind that the global climate has been changing and that the koppen classes have changed as well over the last several decades:\n\n[http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/](http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/)\n\n\n\nIf you mean the ASHRAE climate zone, remember that they were originally developed to describe the US and I am actually unsure about how they have been generalized to the entire planet. \u00a0There may be different methods for generalizing it.\n\n\n\nLooking at the actual temperature values is a better indicator as Mostapha says. \u00a0Also, check the radiation data since (knowing Meteonorm) it is probably derived from satellite measurements as opposed from ground-level pyranometer readings.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 06, 2016 at 02:00PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1476500", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1478458"}
