{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\nThanks a lot for your comment and time.\n\nBecause I have many variables, I think I need to use evolutionary algorithms; it is kind of impossible to consider all possible design combinations of the search space. I checked also DesignExplorer, that also doesn't work for my project.\n\nI will work on it in the next days and will let you know when I had a progress. :)\n\nThanks again for your time.\n\nSaeed\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saeed", "created_at": "October 19, 2016 at 11:47am", "created_by": "Saeed390", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1621229", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1621560"}
