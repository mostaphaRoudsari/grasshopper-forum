{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Antonello,\n\nAs i understand the SHDDesigner doesn't deal with nonplanar surfaces. The definition says \"An optional shade surface representing a 2D area ...\". So i assume you are asking about how it works with such planes? So, just tested and it works fine while the original component didn't.\n\nI am working on an option for nonplanar surfaces and will continue working with Antonello (right?) to get it ready. I suppose we will update the forum at some point if we get things working.\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 23, 2016 at 09:44PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1515445", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1515332"}
