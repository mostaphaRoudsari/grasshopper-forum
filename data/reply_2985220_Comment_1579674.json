{"body": "\nJi,\n\nI had a feeling that your result would surprise me. \u00a0The average zone air temperatures are fairly high in the middle of the day and I admittedly have not run too many simulations with this high of a temperature:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SfsQAdhhVivM9AMDwwAcPHHhit8BDU*vT5MVwiNhq3*EoMD8t9evv0hm9stQTwn9G4C2tcqSfYMN7TbkO-mOFwPK2bYsVPeq/ZoneAirTemp.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SfsQAdhhVivM9AMDwwAcPHHhit8BDU*vT5MVwiNhq3*EoMD8t9evv0hm9stQTwn9G4C2tcqSfYMN7TbkO-mOFwPK2bYsVPeq/ZoneAirTemp.JPG)\n\nYour suggestion about the ordering is noted.You should know that you can change the order to be anything you want just by replacing the paths of the data tree. \u00a0Here is one example that does so (and see attached):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SfsQAdhhViswpOLsbu9ye68zNTZnqQqKCsgutyEciUEqLGhky1*-QprZ0Bn1oPfHeuV6vRuwyTMR*9lgpnTCJCMtzaXFgvzB/ReverseColors.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SfsQAdhhViswpOLsbu9ye68zNTZnqQqKCsgutyEciUEqLGhky1*-QprZ0Bn1oPfHeuV6vRuwyTMR*9lgpnTCJCMtzaXFgvzB/ReverseColors.JPG)\n\nI am also realizing that, when you have fan energy that is this large, the energy balance seems to be \"off-balance\". \u00a0This is making me think that, though the fan energy goes into the zone air, a lot of it may leave through the exhaust air of the zone and this does not seem to be accounted for in the current Nat Vent term that EnergyPlus produces. \u00a0I might investigate this further when I get the chance.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1579675", "name": "NatVentFanTest.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 10, 2016 at 8:05am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579366", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579674"}
