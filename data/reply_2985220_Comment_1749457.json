{"body": "\nHi Christoffer,\n\n\n\nI'll go through your model today and let you know if I find something.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the simulation is running while Rhino has dissapeared sounds like Rhino closed with some error but the VM was still running (it does that, even after we close the docker window).\n\nI'll check the file and see what I find.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 5:09pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749187", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749457"}
