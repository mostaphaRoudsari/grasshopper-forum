{"body": "\nHi!\n\nThis is the first time I try Dynamic Shading in Honeybee, and please let me know if \u00a0there were any mistakes in the grasshopper file.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe case is a simple test box: Curtain on the east glazing wall could either be pulled back at the corner as a 2 meter solid surface, or cover the whole glass as a trans material (trans for now, BSDF in the future). The sensor is on the floor next to the glass: when there is direct sunlight, the curtain expands to cover the whole glass. When there is no direct sunlight on the floor sensor, the curtain is pulled back at the corner.\n\n\n\nHowever, I tried to run the simulation based on this setting and other posts in this forum, **I can only get the ill results as below, and the resultfiles output of the runDaylightAnalysis component shows NULL.**\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/lHx7t9jngWcpUa6FI1a6eRS18wx37YsR6j8ukC4c-iyRC0tgkjPtf9ycXxCy4o4RVxIz7h-0Ub61J-9xjZ1FqmHRd*S9cDb6/Capture.JPG\" width=\"586\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/lHx7t9jngWcpUa6FI1a6eRS18wx37YsR6j8ukC4c-iyRC0tgkjPtf9ycXxCy4o4RVxIz7h-0Ub61J-9xjZ1FqmHRd*S9cDb6/Capture.JPG)\n\n\n\nAny advice on fixing this issue would be much appreciated! I also attached the model and grasshopper file.\n\n\n\nFor the future test, my understanding is: if we control East Shade and South Shade based on the sensor on each side (east sensor and south sensor), they should be two **different Shade Groups**? Thanks!\u00a0\n\n\n\nI checked the old example file here:\u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/dynamic-sha...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/dynamic-shading-analysis-example).\n\n\n\nI also checked the gh file in this discussion:[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/annual-prof...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/annual-profiles-doesnt-math-with-the-point-groups?page=2&amp;commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1202182&amp;x=1#2985220Comment1202182)\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\nBest,\n\nXF\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1713364", "name": "Test_DynamicShading.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1713365", "name": "Test_DynamicShading.gh"}], "created_by_name": "XF", "created_at": "March 15, 2017 at 06:24PM", "created_by": "XF", "topic": "Honeybee Dynamic Shading: Cannot generate result files", "id": "topic_1713366"}
