{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI am working on an energy model, but I am getting the following error:\n\n\n\n**1. Solution exception: Atrium has been moved, scaled or rotated.**\n**If you need to move or rotate a Honeybee object you should use Honeybee move, rotate or mirror components. You can find them under 12|WIP tab.**\n\n\n\nI saw that others had the same problem and that it was a bug that was supposed to be fixed, but I am using the latest version of HoneyBee and LadyBug.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nBlanca\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Blanca Dasi Espuig", "created_at": "March 7, 2016 at 5:37am", "created_by": "BlancaDasiEspuig", "topic": "Atrium has been moved, scaled or rotated.", "id": "topic_1479031"}
