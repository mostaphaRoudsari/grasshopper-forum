{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI have a honeybee file that is generating some HBZones and adjacencies form an initial brep, but it is taking quite some time to recompute every time I change anything down the flow (such as attributes for zone labelling). Especially the separateZonesbyFloor component is taking some time to recomputed, even though there are only 27 zones in 3 floors.\n\nIs there a way to 'freeze' or 'lock' some components that are early in the flow so that it does not recomputed every time I change something down the line?\n\nFor now I have used a 'data' component after separateZonesbyFloor and then internalised the data so that it does not 'go back' (see below)... but can anyone suggest a neater solution?\n\nI've seen a discussion on GH suggesting Geometry Cache component, but it keeps crashing my Rhino.
