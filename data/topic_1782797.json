{"body": "\nDoes anyone have an example file on how this could be done? Is it possible?\n\n\n\nI'm looking to simulate the impact of a Rock Store as an air intake to a space. I was thinking to model this a high thermal mass room, with a given air flow to extract the discharge temperature of the air, and then schedule this as a supply air temp into a separate model. Would this work?\n\n\n\nIf anyone's done it, have any pointers, or have a example file as a starter, I'd greatly appreciate!\n\n\n\nErik\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "erik moore", "created_at": "July 12, 2017 at 7:05am", "created_by": "erikmoore307", "topic": "Thermal Labyrinth modelling", "id": "topic_1782797"}
