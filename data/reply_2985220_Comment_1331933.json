{"body": "\nHi, Chris,\n\n\n\nIt seems the **ColorZones** component can visualize floor-normalized data for **otherZoneData** in Read EP Results now. However, the **3D Chart** component is not responding to the normalized data, and it still shows the non-floor-normalized data for otherZoneData variables.\n\n\n\nDoes this means the **3D Chart** component needs code revision to cope with this kind of scenario?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/OTL0biCLITwL470xTQibZK2DPS8UNzvbfxHI5wzkeQeHlDnj373hR3oDA99xb7vwKFOIqKXcItRuYKT5oj9vvXPiWVjEskrn/07.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/OTL0biCLITwL470xTQibZK2DPS8UNzvbfxHI5wzkeQeHlDnj373hR3oDA99xb7vwKFOIqKXcItRuYKT5oj9vvXPiWVjEskrn/07.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1331934", "name": "tut_test_v028.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "July 25, 2015 at 5:07am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "topic_1330104", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1331933"}
