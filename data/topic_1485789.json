My pc crashed during this (i really dont know why), so i have to redo all the stuff.\n\n[<br/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/m7*E7RUk3WBCxeCtRDrvPiLdGWYMlFRslShg2WGF*j4Qhf*AMopnOcAQ-Y5BnxeYuHETIvbioynYM-vgIxv-svpy5W*2AcKX/ladybug.png)Then the weird thing happened: when i linked a number slider (with a number between 1-12) to _month of the sunpath component, it took like 4 mins to process it, which used to be less than 1 sec. And if i linked a series component to it, everything would be fine... (I didnt even link sunpath to any other thing) So i tried work with series but set count to 1, and this made me another 4 mins to wait... I'm OK with this cuz i dont change month so often, but if i changed the hour, it seems recompute all the things around, so for everytime i want to change it, another 4 mins to go...\u00a0\n\n\n\nI was starting thinking about maybe some files were damaged when my pc crashed, so i deleted all the files and re-installed them for the rar downloaded, still the same. I checked my RAMs to see if there was any problem, nope.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy grasshopper version is 0.9.0076, my processor is i7-3770K@3.5ghz, 16gb DDR3 for RAM. The epw file i'm using is\u00a0FRA_Paris.Orly.071490_IWEC.epw\n\n\n\nCould anyone pls tell me what might be wrong here?\u00a0\n\nThanks!!!\n\n\n\nBest\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "O Loos", "created_at": "March 15, 2016 at 10:38pm", "created_by": "looperpoly", "topic": "File damaged or some kind of bug?", "id": "topic_1485789"}
