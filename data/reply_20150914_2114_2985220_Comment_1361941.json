{"body": "\nAntonio,\n\nGlad that you find it useful. \u00a0I think that you will find the Airflow Network is several thousand times faster than running a CFD and this simplified airflow method with custom objects is even faster. \u00a0As such, you can use an Airflow Network for non-steady-state calculations like those of E+. \u00a0Still, the AFN (and especially this simplified airflow method) only works well if you set it up correctly. \u00a0For this reason, it is sometimes useful to start with a point-in-time CFD calculation and use this to calibrate your AFN or airflow objects first.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 14, 2015 at 09:14PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1361149", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1361941"}
