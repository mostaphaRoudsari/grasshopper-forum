{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nif the reflectance is the same in the IES and Honeybee model, there should be no big discrepancy. I don't know how IES represents the geometry- it uses paper thin walls but has stand in geometry for daylight sims, I assume? - but am pretty sure that if you imported the IES model into GH, and ran it there with identical reflectances, the results would be near identical.\u00a0\n\nBest,\n\nMax\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Max D", "created_at": "July 11, 2016 at 10:12am", "created_by": "ButWhyprecisely", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1563948", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1563992"}
