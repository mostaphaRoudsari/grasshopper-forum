{"body": "\nso the answer from ROB:<br/>Hi Peter,<br/><br/>I am assuming you have Type C photometry files, perhaps some for a directional, amiable luminaire like a track fixture or something like that. In this case you would convert the ies file to\u00a0radiance\u00a0format using ies2ead, and then do your tilting and rotating using the\u00a0Radiance\u00a0xform utility to do translations.<br/><br/>See:<br/>[http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/ies2rad.1.html](http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/ies2rad.1.html)<br/>and<br/>[http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/xform.1.html](http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/xform.1.html)<br/><br/>There are also extensive examples of how to aim luminaries in Rob Shakespeare's art gallery tutorial in Rendering With\u00a0Radiance.<br/><br/>hth,<br/><br/>- Rob<br/><br/>and now I will read through the book etc. :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Za\u0165ko", "created_at": "March 05, 2015 at 05:28AM", "created_by": "PeterZatko", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1234579", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1237035"}
