{"body": "\nHi, Mostapha\n\nThanks for your prompt reply.\n\nI believe I saw two examples published by Boris but I could not figure out a way to follow sunrise/sunset hrs everyday. Then I used a walkaround by modifying weather file to trace down those precise hours everyday.\n\nI may miss details in Boris's example files and video. I will look them again.Thank you so much for your help.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHave a nce weekend!
