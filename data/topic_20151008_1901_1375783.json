{"body": "\nHello Guys,\n\n\n\nI always try to get HB and LB up to date even when there is no official release. On the other side I do the same for the EP application. Is it safe then to delete previous version of EP just work with the latest. In a sens you do get the most up to date weather files.\n\n\n\nAny thoughts or bad experiences\n\n\n\nThank you all\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "October 08, 2015 at 07:01PM", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "Energy plus updates is it safe", "id": "topic_1375783"}
