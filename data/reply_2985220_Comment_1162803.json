{"body": "\nIt's true that the banding is a bit weird and my guess is that it just results from trying to apply a lot of the same Radiance algorithms to a higher resolution dome. \u00a0As far as I remember, the paper in which C Reinhart published the idea of increasing the resolution of the sky dome, it was just about how to divide up the sky patches and validating that it was more accurate. \u00a0I don't think that there was much of a proposal for changing the underlying algorithms. \u00a0Maybe, for the whole year, the Reinhart sky doesn't change the results much but it definitely improves accuracy on an hour-by-hour basis (the sun of one hour is usually divided across 3 or 4 patches any you can imagine that it makes a big difference if those patches are smaller).\n\nIf you do single-hour simulations with the Honeybee Radiance components, I believe that it is possible to get some skies at sub-hourly intervals (I believe that the climate-based sky should do this). \u00a0For entire-year simulations, both the Tregenza dome and the Reinhart dome are already pretty accurate (at least when you consider that your radiation and cloud cover is probably going to vary from year to year anyway).\n\nIf you really need this higher accuracy over the whole year, I think that the only way that you would be able to get it is by editing the Radiance source code and recompiling it. \u00a0Maybe I'm wrong, though.
