{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you very very much -once again- for the explanation.\n\n\n\nFew more questions here trying to really understand Ladybug and Honeybee.\n\n\n\nI am trying to create a generic template for running all the 3 analysis (attached).\n\n\n\nI am not sure what you mean by \"gendaylit,gendaymtx\", I used the genClimateBasedSky and now all the 3 types are working.\n\n\n\nNot sure how I could benefit from the RadiationValues output of the CB sky component. I hope I am not missing any connection there?\n\n\n\nI understand that GRD type of analysis provide results only for certain day and time of the year? Is it possible to do the same analysis for a period of time?\n\n\n\nCould you please explain why\u00a0 the annualDaylightSimulation component doesn t have the same 3 types of Simluation? And also seems to be irrelevant of the SkyFile?\n\n\n\nIs there any difference between the Ladybug Annual Radiation Analysis (attached) and the Honeybee AnnualDaylight Simmulation?\n\n\n\nI highly appreciate any explanation to this long list of questions.\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nDimitris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1180179", "name": "Year_Energy_Analysis.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1180180", "name": "Sustainability_Unit_GRD.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "December 3, 2014 at 9:33am", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "GRD Analyses + Skies", "id": "topic_1180181"}
