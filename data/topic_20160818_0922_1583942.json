{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI am trying to run an outdoor comfort simulation using LB/HB. I would like to assess the effect on thermal comfort of different pavement materials in a public square. I know that the material would affect the Mean Radiant Temperature but I do not know how to calculate the MRT in this case. <br/>My questions are:\n\n- How to estimate the hourly radiant temperature of each part of the square and the surrounding buildings? Can this be done using the Energy+ and Honeybee?\n\n- What temperature should I consider for the sky?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nAlejandro\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "August 18, 2016 at 09:22AM", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "How to calculate outdoor Mean Radiant Temperature using Ladybug/Honeybee", "id": "topic_1583942"}
