{"body": "\nHi Chris, Saeran, and Elliot,\n\n\n\nI think I found what is issue !! Elliot, try if this is the same issue that you have.\n\n\n\nThe UWG component could find the file path because the epw file has different name than the one the UWG component looks for. The epw file is generated but empty. As you can see in the screenshot below that the error is\n\n\"1. Solution exception:Could not find file 'C:\\Users\\Test\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\\SampleCity\\UWG\\SampleCity_SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw'.\n\nand the file that was created has numbers after IWEC (IWEC-641-61024.epw). To make the component works, I deleted the numbers after IWEC from the file name to match the file name the component looks for and rerun it again. By doing that, I got the component runs but again the name changed to be \"SampleCity_SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC-641-61024.epw\" as you can see in the second\u00a0screenshot.\u00a0\n\nI've to do the same process every time I need to run the analysis. I don't know if this issue can be fixed from your end or something to do with my computer.\n\nThank you,\n\nMohammed\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/YPvftwodV05nlI52wWPG59ttzXJqlVPEpesIJg2Vpk*nmgW9UBanKdjB0pHdQSL6iwGt-saqSHTwmuFICseVGyGlZBn0NPOa/1.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/YPvftwodV05nlI52wWPG59ttzXJqlVPEpesIJg2Vpk*nmgW9UBanKdjB0pHdQSL6iwGt-saqSHTwmuFICseVGyGlZBn0NPOa/1.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/YPvftwodV055aqNKawKV5eLwEHLNFbNn02rVQDBpil4G8ftMbEc71hG-4GUaSzL1ZuiTfC43JdsJs7suMJ*BBji33ihcdZLo/2.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/YPvftwodV055aqNKawKV5eLwEHLNFbNn02rVQDBpil4G8ftMbEc71hG-4GUaSzL1ZuiTfC43JdsJs7suMJ*BBji33ihcdZLo/2.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mohammed Alshayeb", "created_at": "September 15, 2017 at 02:20AM", "created_by": "MohammedAlshayeb", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1747229", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1813364"}
