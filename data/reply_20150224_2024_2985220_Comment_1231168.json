{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI need a bit of assistance on the first point.\n\n\n\nI managed to set a workflow that identifies a daylight zone (for example in my case a zone that has above 3.5% DF). Now I am trying to input the two zones (daylight and non daylight), after transforming the mesh to brep, into the daylight simulation to create the two schedules. However, nothing runs and the simulation starts and ends with almost no error, apart from the windows message of \"WMIC process get commandline\".\n\n\n\nI'm hoping this is simply me connecting things wrong so I'll start with just a screenshot and I'll not trouble you with my file (yet).\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1231169", "name": "WMIC error.png"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 24, 2015 at 08:24PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1231268", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1231168"}
