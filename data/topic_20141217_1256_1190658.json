{"body": "\nHi,\n\nFollowing this item in this [discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/insulated-night-shutters?groupUrl=ladybug&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987&amp;id=2985220%3ATopic%3A1184446&amp;page=2#comments) i've found that also the LB_ComfortShadeBenefit is failing.\n\nAttached an example of this failure.\n\nIt complains about\n\n1. Data in the _temperatures input does not possess a valid Ladybug header.\u00a0 Data must have a header to use this component.\n\nEven though i connected the selHourlyData output from theLB_sunpath to the Temperatures input of the ShadeBenefit.\n\nBut in the attached you can see other 3 examples where one input is missing to connect in order to make the component work. Once you connect this the component fails. Of course there are different inputs, while the temperature is connected. The common thing among all cases is that it complains about the same thing.\n\n\n\nI'll appreciate your help.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1190657", "name": "ComfortShadeBenefit.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 17, 2014 at 12:56PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "LB_ComfortShadeBenefit bug", "id": "topic_1190658"}
