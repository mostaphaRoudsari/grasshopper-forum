{"body": "\nChris,\n\nI think it has to to with the\u00a0gendaymtx.exe.\n\nFirst when i run the simulation I got this error:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-a-FzCyHE-A1Hg4eXnjPoWZ354lecSF5xly-P9ULpp4KgMv8krrqYII4jrVwnKZ9lc0OZ6z0NGl2XKeJSvRwntjfyJ8sjG2c/v2.JPG?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-a-FzCyHE-A1Hg4eXnjPoWZ354lecSF5xly-P9ULpp4KgMv8krrqYII4jrVwnKZ9lc0OZ6z0NGl2XKeJSvRwntjfyJ8sjG2c/v2.JPG)Saying that it couldn't download the\u00a0gendaymtx.exe file. So I manually downloaded this file and put it in my appdata/roaming/ladybug/ directory.\n\nThen it seemed to work, it showed the command prompt that it generated the sky etc and that window disapeared after couple of seconds etc. but then when I run the simulation I still get these results:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-a-FzCyHE-B2YEPU15*qAk6TUplsSgAF1CVhT7oL9nPmgYr9GWFIwLXS*XPJ622BOVn4pZzdog2e4QLs3lpminGGBLMNRg48/v1.jpg?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-a-FzCyHE-B2YEPU15*qAk6TUplsSgAF1CVhT7oL9nPmgYr9GWFIwLXS*XPJ622BOVn4pZzdog2e4QLs3lpminGGBLMNRg48/v1.jpg)This is your exact defenition I didn't modify anything.\n\nCould you upload the\u00a0gendaymtx.exe? Or how did you bypass the first error I had, that it couldn't download the\u00a0gendaymtx.exe?\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Arie-Willem de Jongh", "created_at": "October 24, 2014 at 02:33PM", "created_by": "aw", "parent_id": "topic_1154737", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1155358"}
