{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nWe are trying to change the ZoneCapacitanceMultiplier:ResearchSpecial for an energy model to test thermal mass. However, we are not sure how to proceed. We tried a couple of things a failed:\n\n\n\n- How would we add this information to the additionalStrings_ on the HB run energy simulation?\n\n\n\n-We can \u00a0change the values on the idf editor and we can read the results from it, However we are tying to make a parametric model and this manual step is not ideal.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nJuan Carlos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Juan Carlos Fornino", "created_at": "July 5, 2017 at 10:22am", "created_by": "JuanCarlosFornino", "topic": "HB EnergyPlus ZoneCapacitanceMultiplier:ReseachSpecial", "id": "topic_1778856"}
