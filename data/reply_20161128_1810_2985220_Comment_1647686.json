{"body": "\nHi Lasse,\n\n\n\nIf you search on any scientific portal I believe you will find a lot on validation studies between Openfoam and other codes. I was not talking specifically about comparisons I've read but the potential of BF to assess such cases. In your search, try and be specific on what you want, cause validation can focus on codes (i.e software environments like OF and Fluent), solvers (e.g. RNG vs kEpsilon vs kOmega, etc.), meshers, and so many more. Additionally, I'm sure there's a lot of CFD studies of Atrium spaces.\n\n\n\nMyself, I haven't been involved in any validation studies as I have always used CFD on the practical side of things. Therefore, I always trusted OF since it has been heavily validated over the years.\n\n\n\nThe beauty of BF, or at least its end goal, is that you can easily test design alternatives directly from a friendlier and possibly better-known environment of Rhino3D.\n\nI would suggest therefore to just try things out. Design your geometry, in this case the atrium, in Rhino. Decide which are the parameters that you wish to investigate and incorporate those to a GH definition that produces different design alternatives for the range of those parameters (i.e. your parametric model). Then run the cases through BF. There's a couple of examples that come with BF and a few others users are providing either here or on github.\n\n\n\nI'm afraid trial and error is painful with CFD but it's the best way forward. Also, I suggest you bookmark cfd-online.com and skim through everything in there. Most if not all of what we are discussing has been discussed there.\n\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "November 28, 2016 at 06:10PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647910", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647686"}
