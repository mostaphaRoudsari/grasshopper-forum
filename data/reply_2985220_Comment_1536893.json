{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI tried building up the model again in surface-by-surface manner. I found it not very time consuming and gives much better control. I have attached my GH defn. Could you please review it and let me know if there is a better way to do the task. I goal is to have control on surface properties at every stage of analysis.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nRam\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1536894", "name": "Church rd_MASF_V1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ram Joshi", "created_at": "May 26, 2016 at 5:04am", "created_by": "RamJoshi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1533861", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1536893"}
