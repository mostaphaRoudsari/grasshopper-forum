{"body": "\nWhen I am calculating radition, it takes less time, and therefore, galapagos works smoothly. But, when I am calculating the shades (number shaded meshes) using \u00a0'shadowRange' component\u00a0with the changing of parameter, it takes long time, and that is why, galapagos does not rum smoothly; in fact, it hangs. Any solution? My main aim is to do optimization of a free-from facade to get maximum number of self-shaded meshes.
