{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am doing some vertical sky tests on a sample geometry. I am getting funky visualization results. I realize that it probably has to do with my geometry being NURBS, but is there a way around it?\n\n<br/>I'd love to visualize it like Dimitris's picture.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1227203", "name": "VerticalSky.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 19, 2015 at 03:32AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_811691", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1227201"}
