{"body": "\nGrasshoppe,\n\nI forgot to change the name of the data in the Ladybug header when you set the floor normalizing boolean on the result reader to 'True'. \u00a0Also, I was not actually dividing the values by the floor area inside the component. I have fixed this in the attached file and on the github.\n\nTo clarify, there are two places where you can floor-normalize the incoming data mostly for control over whether you want more display options or more speed. \u00a0If all that you care about is energy intensity, you might as well normalize it on import and, that way, all processing of the data after it will be fast (including coloring of zones). \u00a0If you want the option to either normalize it later or not, you should import the data as-is (not normalized) and, that way, you keep the option to normalize it later.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1332572", "name": "tut_test_v017_ZJ_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 26, 2015 at 12:03pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1331933", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1332571"}
