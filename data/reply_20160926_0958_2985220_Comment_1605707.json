{"body": "Hi Aris,\n\nThanks so much for testing this. I buy the argument that multiplying the results by the test region area not only makes it easier to evaluate the total benefit of a shade but is also just a much cleaner metric (degree-days is much more intuitive than degree-days per m2).\n\nI will change the output of the component soon and I have added a github issue for it here:\nhttps://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/296\n\nThanks again and very cool project,\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 26, 2016 at 09:58AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1605669", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1605707"}
