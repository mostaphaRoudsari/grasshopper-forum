{"body": "Hi Pablo\n\nThis is quite interesting and hopefully Chris/Mostapha et al can shed some light. I recently ran a +50 zone model and E+ became a little bit temperamental. I managed to 'force' it by changing some of the glazing ratios. I suspect something in glazing by percentage/child surface is causing it problems.\n\nI think it is getting freaked out by the way the glazing is being built. It may be a tolerance issue in how Rhino deals with the vertices of each surface. I am however most likely wrong.\n\nAnyway, any idea anyone?", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "August 02, 2016 at 01:17PM", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1575214", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1575178"}
