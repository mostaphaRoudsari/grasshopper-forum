{"body": "\nHi\n\n\n\nSo i am looking at different facade framing patterns with varying u-values. One of the options has a thermal break and the other does not. The one without the thermal break has a higher u-value than the one with as you'd expect.\n\n\n\nWhen I run this through honeybee I find that the solution without a thermal break has a lower peak cooling load than the one with - which makes no sense. I don't know if I have messed up the material construction somehow. I do find that the peak heating load follows behavior that i would expect to see.\n\n\n\nWould someone mind having a look at my attached file and letting me know what I am doing wrong please?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nDuncan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1422473", "name": "151214_AOAA.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1422474", "name": "151216_Panel_Study.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "December 16, 2015 at 9:29am", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "topic": "Odd cooling loads", "id": "topic_1422475"}
