{"body": "\nHi Grasshoppe,\n\n\n\nI don't see anything irregular in the solution folder. It must be something to do with paraFoam itself.\n\n\n\nDid you use paraview by actually typing paraview and navigating to the folder or did you type paraFoam to call the OF integrated paraview, or did you maybe type paraFoam -builtin? The last one was a workaround for when paraview installation has issues. I think I remember an old bug where the version not connected to OF would give out this error. I will check it as soon as I can to make sure it's not smth in our case setup.\n\n\n\nConcerning the boxes on the display that is the refinement of your mesh. The fastest way to get a more refined image is to go back to your blockMesh and change the number of cells in x and y directions (and thus the size of these squares) and go through the whole process of meshing and solving again. Bare in mind doubling the cell number makes a 4 times bigger mesh, which would also delay the simulation a bit (but really for such a small model it would still be fairly fast).\n\n\n\nAnother thing you can do in coarse or even medium quality meshes is to display the point values and not the cell values. You can do that in the dropdown menu where you select which fluid parameter to display (U, p, k, epsilon, etc.). In your screenshot I can see the cell value is currently selected. By selecting point values Parafoam should interpolate the display automatically and provide a more 'refined' image (but not a more accurate result). Should make a small difference in such a coarse mesh but this works quite nicely in medium to better meshes.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "August 06, 2016 at 10:06AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1577631", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1577456"}
