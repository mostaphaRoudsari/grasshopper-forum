{"body": "\nRiccardo,\n\n\n\nI understand. \u00a0You mean that you want to do a Sizing Calculation. \u00a0The OpenStudio component does this calculation before they start every energy simulation in order to size the HVAC properly. \u00a0You can get the value in Watts out of this calculation by parsing the .eio file like so:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/HA1kPj-97*EmPnscpbWrB*FKtpJjSpEiwvmJHHh7f2ZE167Sb3F3V-cRGVN3lUFAPNH3VQk3dpcaVGNIg1ZbishP3*sYDJrj/SizingCalculation.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/HA1kPj-97*EmPnscpbWrB*FKtpJjSpEiwvmJHHh7f2ZE167Sb3F3V-cRGVN3lUFAPNH3VQk3dpcaVGNIg1ZbishP3*sYDJrj/SizingCalculation.JPG)\n\n\n\nYou see that you can also specify a custom Design Day file using the EnergySimPar component if you don't want to use the ddy file that comes with the epw.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1601765", "name": "OpenStudio Sizing Claculation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 19, 2016 at 5:18am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1601911", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1601764"}
