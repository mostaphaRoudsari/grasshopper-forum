{"body": "\nHi Albert,\n\nI definitely recommend getting comfortable with Rhino and it will pay off a lot in the long run (Rhino's geometric capabilities are a lot greater than Sketchup in a number of key areas). It is also worth mentioning that, if you haven't used them yet, we have a few components that can help you manage and format your geometry in the way that E+ likes (including components to split building masses into core/perimeter zones and a component to ensure that there are reciprocal matching surfaces of adjacent zones). \u00a0These 3 videos in the Honeybee Energy Modeling tutorial series should help you use them in your workflow:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDvBWDA0aF0&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDvBWDA0aF0&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=10)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DClON71RuuA&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DClON71RuuA&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=11)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMQ2Pau4q6c&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMQ2Pau4q6c&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=12)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 6, 2014 at 1:41am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183119", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182286"}
