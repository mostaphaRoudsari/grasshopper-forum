{"body": "\nHey Chris or anyone familiar with the MRT component!\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out if and how varying g-values (SHGC) of windows in the fa\u00e7ade affect (adjusted) indoor comfort in specific locations in a room.\n\nIn a hypothetical situation (see image), I have 1 room with 4 fa\u00e7ade windows and 4 skylights. The windows have different g-values for which I have list of 8 window transmissivities from the EPlus simulation.\n\nI have 10 test points where I\u2019m interested in measuring the adjusted MRT, i.e the body location input.\n\nSince no geometry can be input for windows in the adjusted MRT component, do the 8 window transmissivities from the EPlus engine have any correlation to their actual position when I input them in the adjusted MRT component?\u00a0\n\n/Amanda\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1422514", "name": "MRTsituation.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1422515", "name": "MRTsituation2.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Amanda O'Donnell", "created_at": "December 16, 2015 at 06:26AM", "created_by": "AmandaODonnell", "topic": "Solar Adjusted MRT - effect of different window geo and g-value?", "id": "topic_1422516"}
