{"body": "\nFrancesco,\n\nAre you looking for a component that takes a fisheye image as an input or a workflow to create the whole process in Grasshopper? Grasshopper's Image sampler does take an image and returns the colors for each pixel. You can use Honeybee to render a fish-eye view looking to the sky and then count the number of sky pixels. Apply a black material to all the geometries, generate a uniform sky and set -ab to 0 and pick a high value for -ar.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 06, 2016 at 07:18AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1652894", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1653116"}
