{"body": "\nBTW today it was the first time i used the SeparateByOrientation, and i don't get the output. It gives a vector, but i don't get which vector is it. Of the exterior walls, of the zone ... or? And there is something i can do with this output? Maybe i'm not enough focused ...\n\n\n\nHi Abraham, This component is most useful if zone have glazing only on one side. For the use case imagine if you want to change the glazing construction for all the walls facing west to be different. You can use this component to separate the zones, find the ones facing west and change their construction.\n\nVector list shows the vector direction of glazing/outdoor faces. Here is an example:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ja6gu*i0lR6i3liKx1RU-WKPP31rlQCqRDgZCiIMNlYt6s5V2yc8Q2y715f9ds5uEDA*zyDUrl-4OYeCsy20tep*cg0UV3Qh/separateByOrientation.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ja6gu*i0lR6i3liKx1RU-WKPP31rlQCqRDgZCiIMNlYt6s5V2yc8Q2y715f9ds5uEDA*zyDUrl-4OYeCsy20tep*cg0UV3Qh/separateByOrientation.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1324819", "name": "separateByOrientation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 13, 2015 at 6:00am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279197", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1324818"}
