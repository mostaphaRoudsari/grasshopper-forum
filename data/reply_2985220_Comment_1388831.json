{"body": "\nHey Mona,\n\nCurrently I don't have any specific questions, I encounter them on the way and then try to google and see if I can make sense out of it. But to be honest, I could post any single analysis chart here and hear what experienced users can say, maybe start a session where users can help each other?\n\nThanks for the doc, nice to have a written explanation under your hand. Also, maybe [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLk_HHCQOzQ)\u00a0will be useful for somebody. Started out with this video myself, turns out ladybug uses simplified psychometric chart, maybe for good XD\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "October 28, 2015 at 10:06pm", "created_by": "Timur582", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1388654", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1388831"}
