{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI'm having some issues with the Add HbGlz component after my update to the latest version for both HB and LB. Was just wondering if anyone else is having similar problems or it's something I am missing at the moment.\n\nI've tried the simplest of cases, manual as well as scale1d windows, and I can't seem to make it work. The windows don't appear in the surface preview (which sometimes happens I know), nor in the zone preview or the decompose by type preview component, which shows empty in the window type surfaces.\n\nDon't have a case file to share really as I've been trying in a simple box with 1 window. Anyone else facing this?\n\n\n\nEdit: Using the older Add HbGlz component (Jan 26 2016) seems to work, that is the glazing surfaces are now created and being displayed. However, I am now getting an error in the EnergyPlus component (\"Solution exception: need more than 7 values to unpack.\"). Tried using old and new glazing component, using one simple zone, changing my weather file, the error seems to be persistent.\n\n\n\nEdit2: Using the old E+ component seems to work.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "July 03, 2016 at 10:30PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Issues with Add HbGlz Component after the update", "id": "topic_1559824"}
