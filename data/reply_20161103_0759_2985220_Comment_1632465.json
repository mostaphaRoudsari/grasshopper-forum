{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThank you for your reply.\u00a0\n\nImagine the mass is a concrete wall and there are large windows on the walls of the room. Then if I divide the mass into an InternalMass and a ContextSrf there would be 2 problems:\n\n\n\n1- It's not possible to assign an E+ construction material to the outer part of the mass (ContextSrf). Therefore its surface temperature would remain the same as the weather around.\n\n2- The internal mass won't be affected by the sun. It also won't thermally interact with the outer part of the mass. Take into account that in reality there is no thermal break between the interior and the exterior parts of the mass. It is a single continuous concrete wall.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nAry\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aryan Shahabian", "created_at": "November 03, 2016 at 07:59AM", "created_by": "AryanShahabian", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1632374", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1632465"}
