{"body": "\nMona,\n\nI just gave a response to your shading question. \u00a0Are you using compatible versions for the comfort map components? \u00a0Try updating your file with the 'Update Honeybee' component and, if you still have the issue after syncing with the github like this, upload your GH file and I will take a look.\n\nClimate change differences of 30 years are likely not going to make a big difference, especially if you are far from the polar regions, which will experience a much larger change in temperature than the equator. \u00a0It laso makes a difference what type of building you are simulating. If you are making a well-insulated structure that is almost thermally isolated from the surrounding climate, climate change will not affect it much. \u00a0A passive or naturally ventilated structure is likely to experience a larger effect.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 15, 2015 at 03:31PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1325784", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1326572"}
