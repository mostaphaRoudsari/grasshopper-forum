{"body": "\nHello everyone\n\nI want to run a daylight simulation with honey bee. I have modeled my building in Rhino and I want to run daylight autonomy for the floor of one room in the first floor of the building (school). But I don't know how to give wall, roof, ceiling .... thickness to honeybee. Do I need to seperate each room for each zone?\n\nBecause I have one room to simulate and the context which is other rooms.. But I don't know if I need to seperate each part of the original room from other rooms or not??\n\nBy the way I attached my model and the algorithm I have written.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1650719", "name": "950901.rar"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1650720", "name": "950823.gh"}], "created_by_name": "leila pasandi", "created_at": "December 2, 2016 at 10:18am", "created_by": "leilapasandi", "topic": "model in Rhino for daylight simulation in Honeybee", "id": "topic_1650721"}
