{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nThank you for pointing this out. \u00a0Because of this issue, I realized that Rhino's DeleteFaces() method for meshes completely destroys the original order of the faces in the mesh, which was causing a mis-calculation of the area that meets the threshold. \u00a0I have fixed this now by running the area calculation before the deletion of faces and this give perfect agreement between the mesh threshold selector and the totalRadiation:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KIUhBV3mdZ-DhEe7lusq2B9PO5zETadypPXUeV2wj0DHtwV2MYfAptBWvUvNg*5WIW1crV6hktgg5arscKiIyN9Yp6bEdv4b/MeshFaceAreas.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KIUhBV3mdZ-DhEe7lusq2B9PO5zETadypPXUeV2wj0DHtwV2MYfAptBWvUvNg*5WIW1crV6hktgg5arscKiIyN9Yp6bEdv4b/MeshFaceAreas.JPG)\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/3c75d204afbcfb53...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/3c75d204afbcfb53cca26c65e3d81452412d8d3e)\n\nThe reason why the Grasshopper manual calculation result is a little different is because of tolerance issues (Grasshopper is rounding off the number of decimal places for each mesh face area). \u00a0The results output from the Ladybug components are the more accurate results.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1686453", "name": "meshSelectorissue_v04.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 6, 2017 at 4:35pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1676305", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1686451"}
