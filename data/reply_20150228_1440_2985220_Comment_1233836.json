{"body": "\nAfter I updated my HB using the update Honeybee components the simulation fails, it used to run fine right before the update.

I really need to figure out what's happening with this as I have a deadline to finish this work for a research paper I'm working on.\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/njfi925B3DAvaAeiVWw0pvDxb8tFaLliEAb7JVf*jiibZFOULHNOfjXiUvIzlmuIgWXDcshJEWCbKyBjaAg3oP2uHQTA9I3*/Canvasat153527.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/njfi925B3DAvaAeiVWw0pvDxb8tFaLliEAb7JVf*jiibZFOULHNOfjXiUvIzlmuIgWXDcshJEWCbKyBjaAg3oP2uHQTA9I3*/Canvasat153527.png)\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "February 28, 2015 at 02:40PM", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "topic_1233192", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1233836"}
