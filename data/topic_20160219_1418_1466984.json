{"body": "\nHello Everyone!\u00a0\n\n\n\nFirst-- thank you for all the hard work. The fact that Ladybug exists is amazing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSecond-- my problem. I am trying to break up psychrometric analysis by season and by day/night, so 8 graphs total (4 seasons, 2 conditions). I am just going to do this with four separate psychrometric chart components. I can use the analysis period to block out the 4 seasons, no problem. I can also write a conditional statement using c&lt;=0 for direct radiation to get whether it is nighttime or daytime (or something in between if I use a value other than zero). However, when I try to connect both, I receive an error:\u00a0\n\n\"1. Solution exception:global name 'getHOYsBasedOnPeriod' is not defined\"\n\n\n\nI've updated my ladybug, and replaced all the components involved. I attach the file that I'm working on, and the Vienna weather data that I'm using as a test.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThoughts or help would be much appreciated! (Under a bit of a deadline here, actually)\n\nAlexander\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1466982", "name": "Psychrometrics_day_night_problem.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1466983", "name": "AUT_Vienna.Schwechat.110360_IWEC.epw"}], "created_by_name": "AMJaco", "created_at": "February 19, 2016 at 02:18PM", "created_by": "AMJaco", "topic": "Psychrometric Chart Problem", "id": "topic_1466984"}
