{"body": "\nHi Orn,\n\nAs far as I can see in your example lightshelf does what it is supposed to do: 1. scatter the light into the space and 2. Shade the surrounding area. You should have a more even distribution of the light with lightshelf.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DqaYw0w2aP*UlOQARdgT9obMjTAVABhSKDSeSDlhRt88EW*U8WJGCQVNUv8nwO8l1DDFLxWzcjS-K5B5jTsn50G4CaTddXTM/TopView.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DqaYw0w2aP*UlOQARdgT9obMjTAVABhSKDSeSDlhRt88EW*U8WJGCQVNUv8nwO8l1DDFLxWzcjS-K5B5jTsn50G4CaTddXTM/TopView.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some parameters that you can change to have a better idea from the effects of your lightshelf.\n\n\n\n1. I would make the room deeper so you get some dark space at the end of the room.\n\n2. I would make the room wider while keeping the test grid in the center to avoid the effect of the side walls. You can also assign black colors to the side walls.\n\n3. Set a view from inside the room and render the images. You will see how lightshelf changes the daylight pattern inside the space. Creating false color images also helps for an easier to understand visualization.\n\n3. Now try it for different times of the year to see the effect of the sun angle (both on the grid and the images).\n\n4. Finally run an annual analysis with and without lightshelf.\n\n\n\nSetting the parameters to a higher quality will mainly change the results at the end of the room. As Abraham mentioned for this case you need to increase the number of bounces.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 24, 2014 at 10:16PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1031510", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1032010"}
