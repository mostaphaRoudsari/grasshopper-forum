{"body": "\nOK.\n\nOne more thing to test. if you go to C:\\ladybug\\JackTest053\\imageBasedSimulation and run (double click) SETEXPOSURE.BAT and then HDR2GIF.BAT you get the gif image? If you don't, i think you have a faulty Radiance installation. Both files, ra_gif and ra_tiff, should be included in the installation. Please also check the directory c:\\Radiance\\bin and look for those two files.\n\nBTW, the command where ra_tiff is location independent. So it doesn't matter where you run it. As long as the exe file is in your path (should be transparent for any user, since Radiance installation takes care of that).\n\nI believe the \"solution\" is nearby.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 05, 2014 at 03:38AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1083408", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1083482"}
