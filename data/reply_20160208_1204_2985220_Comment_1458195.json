{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nYour file is practically working for me. In any case i updated it to last GH version. Probably the reason it wasn't working is becouse the hydra file used \"old\" components and your version installed is newer ... and probably (#2) you had other files opened ...\n\nIn any case the hydra file is not correct in its description and goal. The file is not giving you SVF (as you want) but VSC (vertical sky component). For more info on this see this [discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/sky-view-factor-vs-vertical-sky-component).\n\nFor SVF Chris re-wrote the LB_viewAnalysis component.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 08, 2016 at 12:04PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1458224", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1458195"}
