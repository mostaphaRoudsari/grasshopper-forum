{"body": "\nHi All!\n\n\n\nAs a quick question for Chris and Mostapha, and anyone else who knows, I am trying to run a parametric iteration study, but it is going to take a long time for them all to run if it can only run one energy and daylight simulation at a time.\n\n\n\nIs there a way to run the idfs created as a group run like what energyplus launcher can do with native energyplus?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "September 22, 2015 at 4:25pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Running several E+ simulations at a time?", "id": "topic_1366608"}
