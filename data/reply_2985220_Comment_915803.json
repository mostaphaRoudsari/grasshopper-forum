{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThanks for the hard work. I am trying to do sun hours with ladybug. I also noticed some differences in the results, comparing different sources. I read all the comments in this discussion and saw some new components being used. I have version.0.0.35, therefore, missing the new components from february/july. Are these components already available? If yes, where can I download them?\n\nThanks a lot,\n\nAlejandra C\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandra", "created_at": "September 17, 2013 at 2:49am", "created_by": "Alejandra", "parent_id": "topic_906401", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_915803"}
