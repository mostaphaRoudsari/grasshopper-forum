{"body": "\nHi Hamid,\n\n... EPW gives us 8760 hours data file that feeds into the diffuse and direct and ground-reflect solar radiation.\n\n[EnergyPlus directNormalRadiation](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/auxiliary-programs/energyplus-weather-file-epw-data-dictionary.html#field-direct-normal-radiation)\u00a0is the radiation received on a surface perpendicular to the sun rays.<br/>Ladybug Photovoltaics components supports fixed PV systems, not tracking ones.<br/>So to get the incident radiation on a fixed\u00a0_PV_SWHsurface we need to correct the .epw directNormalRadiation for the angle of incidence:<br/><br/>Ib = directNormalRadiation * cos(angleOfIncidence)<br/><br/>EnergyPlus does not contain the ground reflected component.<br/><br/>\n\n<br/>but, it is not clear that we used all 8760 hours data or average the data for a whole year or....?\n\nThe incident solar radiation is calculated for each hour during a year in kWh/m2. Then all those hourly values are summed, to get the annual incident solar radiation in kWh/m2 for the inputted _PV_SWHsurface.\n\n\n\nand second questions is there is no any azimuth parameter inside the formulas. And how mesh is created without considering any azimuth parameter (see picture below).\n\nI did not understand you.<br/>The azimuth is not present in which formulas? Can you make a screenshot and label them?<br/>Thank you.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 19, 2016 at 11:04am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "topic_1568511", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1568387"}
