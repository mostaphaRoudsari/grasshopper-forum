{"body": "\nThank you so much.\u00a0\n\nNow the components works well.\n\n\n\nI have tried to resimulate the energy needs, with different setting (no shade and different shading device configurations) but the results don't change. Is the workflow correct?\u00a0\n\n\n\nAbout the complex shading, I kept it enabled because it takes a lot to start when gh file starts. I enabled it for the simulation. I know that it takes a lot to solve.\n\nDo you know some technique in order to reduce the number of surface? or other method to evaluated it? Doesn't the simulation run due to the surface number?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nAndrea\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1486421", "name": "Simulation1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Andrea Zani", "created_at": "March 16, 2016 at 2:09pm", "created_by": "AndreaZani905", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1485506", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1486420"}
