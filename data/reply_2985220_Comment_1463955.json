{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\n\n\nGlad that you were able to solve the issue. \u00a0Solve Adjacencies will rewrite all of your boundary conditions of your zone (except for ground surfaces) unless you set _removeCurrentAdjc to 'False'.\n\n\n\nA couple of tricks that might make your life easier:\n\n1) If you set the altBC on the Solve Adjacency component to 'Adiabatic', all internal surfaces will be set with an adabatic boundary condition (this is useful if you are not worried about inter-zone heat exchange and want a fast, multi-zone model).\n\n\n\n2) The most recent 'Make Adiabatic by Type' component was designed such that you should never have to construct a zone with HBSrfs if all that you want to do is set certain surfaces to adiabatic:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNjIAz6oV4JBVFDw66YsB1*DM5r9NWtexBIOReKyZtiVvHH2t*dbMNbSuVy2JlMr*ArA7zW8Y*S4KLF3vJ8iRVSn/MakeAdiabaticbyType.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNjIAz6oV4JBVFDw66YsB1*DM5r9NWtexBIOReKyZtiVvHH2t*dbMNbSuVy2JlMr*ArA7zW8Y*S4KLF3vJ8iRVSn/MakeAdiabaticbyType.JPG)\n\nNotably, the 'Walls_' input can take a list of booleans and make surfaced adiabatic based on their cardinal orientation (North, East, South, West). \u00a0So you can construct your zones with the Mass2Zone component, which will make your file smaller.\n\n\n\n3) Assigning constructions after you have solved adjacencies will allow you to assign different constructions depending on whether surfaces are interior or exterior and might also help make it possible for you to use the mass2Zone component.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 15, 2016 at 5:43pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463355", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463955"}
