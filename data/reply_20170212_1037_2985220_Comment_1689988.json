{"body": "\nSolon,\n\nYou understood me perfectly. That is a precise way to go about it. LBNL Windows Tool can help you calculate U-factor of different window assemblies. The tool has a\u00a0good database for glazing and a few options for frames.\n\n\n\nIf you have a detailed section for the window assembly, then you could calculate the U-factor for frames using THERM, and use the frame U-value in LBNL Windows to create your custom frame. LBNL Windows will write an .idf\u00a0file that you can directly import your workflow using Honeybee_import WINDOW IDF Report component.\n\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "February 12, 2017 at 10:37AM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1689884", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1689988"}
