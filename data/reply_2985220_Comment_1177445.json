{"body": "\nThis is a really good question!\n\nI have tried using Chameleon (a plugin for both Revit and GH), that allow importing gb.xml files exported from Revit. The problem is often the import of the model is not that good. It is limited to only import the simple energy model geometry.\n\nThere is also a connection from CASE, that export Rooms from Revit to GH directly. But I have never tried it. As seen in the linked video, it only transfer the geometry, no windows or noting: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zclpoUUqSlk&amp;list=UUqJXNsH0Tx1U2...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zclpoUUqSlk&amp;list=UUqJXNsH0Tx1U2WaDddCGR9Q)\n\nA basic problem when exporting energy models from Revit is that, the models is typical not that good. In many cases there is a lot of smal air gabs and other strange things in the export. In fact this is also a issue when running energy simulations within Revit with GBS.\n\nWhy would people try to export and import models in GH with all properties? Knowing the settings in Revit is really limited. Only the constructions could be nice to have in the import to Honeybee, or?\n\nIs it to get a more accurate result, or to use the benefit of Honeybee and GH's parametric possibilities? If so, is it needed to have all properties added in Revit?\n\nWhat I have done more often is importing these simple xml models into GH for running daylight simulations. Instead of export a whole detailed model. Because the numbers of surfaces determines the simulation speed therefore a more zone model is much better.\n\n/daniel\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "daniel nielsen", "created_at": "November 28, 2014 at 10:19am", "created_by": "arkdanielnielsen", "parent_id": "topic_1177037", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1177445"}
