{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThanks a lot for the quick response. I will try it whenever grasshopper wants to cooperate with me a bit more. ;). I am having problems with GH whenever I try to open it. Very few times it opens inmediately,sometimes it opens, but takes ages and some time it doesnt open at all. I have the version 0.9.0056 (may 16). Can you give me a hint? Is is the version? Any suggestions are appreciated.\n\nBest,\n\nAlejandra\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandra", "created_at": "September 18, 2013 at 03:47AM", "created_by": "Alejandra", "parent_id": "topic_906401", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_916961"}
