{"body": "\nHi Nicholas, Welcome!\n\nI didn't check your file but 1. these cases are almost always the case of slightly non-planar surfaces. Remodeling the surface should solve the problem. 2. To double check how your geometry gets exported to energyplus try to write the idf and then open it in another software like OpenStudio. You can also run the analysis with EPRUN and generate a dxf file from your model which you can use for quality check.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 07, 2016 at 04:18AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1560453", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1561376"}
