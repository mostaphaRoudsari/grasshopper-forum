My aim is to find the best orientation for minimize the total radiation and manage the one that i got on the corners with vegetation.\n\nAs you can see it is working great! But\u00a0I've\u00a0two questions\n\n0_ how can I increase the resolution on the analysis's mesh? It depends of the brep?\n\n1_ I see that you did an orientation capsule, but I didn't manage to adapt the rotation of a tower. So I did it with\u00a0Galapagos\u00a0but it was slow, Do you have any\u00a0thought\u00a0of how it could be with lady bug tools?\n\n\u00a0\n\npd: the tower next to it is the context\n\nGracias\n\nCheers\n\nJos\u00e9 Miguel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A847504", "name": "0_1_base giro_radiacion.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Jose Miguel Armijo", "created_at": "May 7, 2013 at 10:55pm", "created_by": "JoseMiguelArmijo", "topic": "Orientation study: Rotation Tower", "id": "topic_847505"}
