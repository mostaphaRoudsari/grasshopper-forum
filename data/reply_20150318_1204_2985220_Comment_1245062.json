{"body": "\nThanks for taking the time to look at it and for the quick turn around too!\n\nYes, definitely too big of a project for the first try, but I gotta do it nonetheless...\n\n\n\nActually the zoning has already slightly changed since I started cleaning up the geometry (we're in SD phase) and will evolve no matter what, hence me wanting to do it in grasshopper.\n\n\n\nI see you've probably done the intersecting yourself in Rhino. How did you do this this quickly? Is there an easy command? Is this just \"Intersect\"?\n\n\n\nAt the input of Masses2Zones object, you have a brep connected to a brep. Is there a reason for this?\n\n\n\nAlso, the Masses2Zones object still stays it can't check normal directions for a few zones. Is it safe to ignore it or should I expect weird results going forward?\n\n\n\nThanks again,\n\nJulien\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julien Marrec", "created_at": "March 18, 2015 at 12:04PM", "created_by": "JulienMarrec", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1245112", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1245062"}
