{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n\n\n1. Since State 1 (curtain was pulled over at the corner) always exists unless the curtain is in State 2 (covering the glass), the illuminance value for State 1 is \u00a0min 0 lux, max 1 lux; the illuminance value for State 2 is min 9999 lux max 10000 lux.\n\n2. Please correct me if I were wrong, I set up a Thermal Control with 1 interior sensor, and I didn't set any lighting groups in the model. But to your point: I sometimes found lighting group control data in\u00a0intgain.csv although I didn't set anything. I thought only the manual control will trigger the Light Switch Model in Daysim?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\nBest,\n\nXF\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "XF", "created_at": "April 07, 2017 at 09:08AM", "created_by": "XF", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1729080", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1729306"}
