{"body": "Abraham and Tim,\n\nThanks for bringing this up. The issue seems to be that Rhino does not export the text objects to illustrator unless the view is in the same plane as the text.\n\nIf we find an export method that we like for this type of case, I can implement a bake option for it. Some possible things that we should test/try to see if they work or if we like them:\n\n1) Add the text as text dots - I don't know if this will work but, if it does, this seems to be the only way that we could get editable text from a perspective export to illustrator.\n\n2) Add the text as black hatches- this will export the text as black-colored vector objects (like the colored hatches of the mesh currently). So the text will not be editable in Illustrator but it will look the way that it does in Rhino, you can change the color of it, and you can scale it.\n\nIf you let me know your thoughts on this, we can put together a plan. I'll try to put together some examples of what I am talking about in case this is not clear.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 25, 2016 at 04:44PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1491514", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1492265"}
