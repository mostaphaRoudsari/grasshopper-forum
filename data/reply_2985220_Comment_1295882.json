{"body": "\nHi Nite,\n\nIt seems that Abraham might know more about what you are trying to do but, from the perspective of someone just coming into the discussion, it sounds like you should narrow down your objectives to just 2-3 that you know are in conflict with one another (for example, day-lighting that hits a certain threshold and minimizing cooling load). \u00a0Otherwise, you might end up with a result that is not that surprising. If you are interested in how the two variables of form and glazing ratio are interacting with each other, you should optimize for both at the same time. \u00a0I will warn that the glazing based on ratio component uses an \"OffsetCurveOnSurface\" Rhino command that can be buggy at times when the surface curvature becomes too great. \u00a0So you may want to planarize the geometry before this or set some curvature bounds on your design space.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 26, 2015 at 4:00pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1287594", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1295882"}
