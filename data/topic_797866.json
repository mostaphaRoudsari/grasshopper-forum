{"body": "\nHi!<br/><br/>I just started playing around with Ladybug (great by the way) but I am still trying to get the hang of the whole thing. Is it possible you could upload a sample sunpath file to fully understand all the components.<br/><br/>I am wondering if there is any way of scaling the sunpath itself before baking. I am also having triuble customizing the color output. <br/><br/>I would greatly appreciate any info you can give us on this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBest!<br/>Andres\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andres Oyaga Loewy", "created_at": "February 27, 2013 at 9:48am", "created_by": "AndresOyagaLoewy", "topic": "SUNPATH?", "id": "topic_797866"}
