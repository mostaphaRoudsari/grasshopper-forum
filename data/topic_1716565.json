{"body": "\nHi!\u00a0\n\nWhile working on the dynamic shading I have a quick question about the maximum shading groups we could have in one annual simulation: how many shading groups can we have in one annual simulation with advanced dynamic shading control? According to this post, the number is 2:\u00a0[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/414](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/414)\n\n\n\nHoneybee advancedDynamixSHDRecipe allows multiple (&gt;2) Shading States for each Shading Group, which is helpful if we have one Shading Group like Venetian blinds (controlled by 1 interior sensor but could be open at multiple angles). If on one facade, we have 4 curtains that each one has 1 interior sensor on the wall facing the center of the curtain to control open/close (2 states), ideally there will be 4 shading groups. If the upper limit is 2, shall we run the simulation twice, each time with 2 shading groups while keeping the other 2 curtains closed?\n\n\n\nThanks for your help in advance!\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nXF\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "XF", "created_at": "March 20, 2017 at 9:32am", "created_by": "XF", "topic": "Honeybee Dynamic Shading: Maximum Shading Groups", "id": "topic_1716565"}
