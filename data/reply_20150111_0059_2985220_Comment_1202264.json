{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nThis is a bug with the Rhinocommon \"OffsetCurveOnSurface\" method. \u00a0If the curvature becomes too great, the method fails. \u00a0There's nothing that we can do about it as far as I understand except report it to Guilio and hope that it is better in Rhino 6. \u00a0I imagine that offsetting the window in Rhino manually would likely produce the same erroneous curve. \u00a0Han, if you really need a window with that great of a curvature, you might try a few different manual method in Rhino (like trimming the original surface with planes) to get the geometry of the window you desire. \u00a0Then you can use the surface-by-surface method to make your zones.\n\nMostapha, are you ok with me closing out your github issue?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 11, 2015 at 12:59AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1188831", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1202264"}
