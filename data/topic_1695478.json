{"body": "\n\n\nHi,\n\n\n\nI'm modeling a project of multiple zones and I have an issue when I add ZoneName list. Here is a simplified version. I have Zone 2 through 5 with a total cooling loads of 135,637, 38,674, 72,725, 65,324 kWh for each zone, respectively. As shown in the next two screenshots.

I changed Zone 2 to \"Kitechen2nd\", Zone 3 to \"Kitechen1st\", Zone 4 to \"DiningW\", and Zone 5 to \"DiningE\". As shown in the screenshot.

However, when I looked to the result, I saw that the new names don't represent the correct zone. For example, Zone 2 has a total cooling load of 135,637 and when I changed the name of the zone to be \"Kitechen2nd\", it shows a cooling load of 65,324. as shown here.\u00a0[04.png](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NxE20jujyI8pENsqwoqV168TSPjBioOufrwJCZJRZW7YuO9oZTlw393eK3jP-EEdxn6Ee5Ol5-PK3JO3HxBRAe44v0c3eZLG/04.png).\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt's weird because HB assigned the new names correct but when I readEPresults, the values were assigned to different zones. An idea? Did I miss something?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mohammed Alshayeb", "created_at": "February 19, 2017 at 4:49pm", "created_by": "MohammedAlshayeb", "topic": "ZoneNames", "id": "topic_1695478"}
