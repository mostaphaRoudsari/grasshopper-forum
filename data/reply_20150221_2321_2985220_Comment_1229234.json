{"body": "\nHey Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for the answer. I wasn't sure how E+ simulates it. It sounds pretty good actually. And yes, I totally agree with you that CFD, at least on this level, is quite out of scope and probably reach. Although things get much faster in our beowulf cluster (Can I use that for my LB+HB? :) )\n\n\n\nI am mostly using it for urban planning on a larger level, where the model can be much more simplified or for smaller scales (e.g. rooms) with very specific design parameters, and of course short periods of time.\n\n\n\nI am waiting eagerly on the arrival of butterfly, CFD is probably what I'd like to see next in this suite.\n\n\n\nHave a nice day,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 21, 2015 at 11:21PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1229211", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1229234"}
