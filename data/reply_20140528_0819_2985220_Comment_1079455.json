{"body": "\nThank you Abraham for your effort and your advice (about good behaviour to improve my workflow). I did a lot of attempts:\n\n1) update my GH to last version; (after tried to run your GH_A version file)\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/MjUiWVyv*JIyr8ob5V*-whtbCCYi6kXXvZ4BmWkqI-iVYCAGQzQn66ImQ7*CO79*QVPDcShZUunhoNPDHs5SJ0yan5T9A6sL/error_gh_vers.PNG?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/MjUiWVyv*JIyr8ob5V*-whtbCCYi6kXXvZ4BmWkqI-iVYCAGQzQn66ImQ7*CO79*QVPDcShZUunhoNPDHs5SJ0yan5T9A6sL/error_gh_vers.PNG)\n\n\n\n2) updated LHHB files by tour \"update component\" (because i've noticed from this link\u00a0[https://app.box.com/s/02d7kp230vb045i9j4ix](https://app.box.com/s/02d7kp230vb045i9j4ix) there's old version yet)\n\n3)I replaced every component with the new ones (HB 0.53).\n\nThe result is the same, HDR&gt;GIF componet displays:\n\n1. Failed to genearate the .gif file. Open the bat file with a text editor and change the last line from exit to pause. Then run it again and see what is the error.<br/>here is the file address: c:/ladybug//JackTest053/imageBasedSimulation//HDR2GIF.BAT\n\n\n\nMaybe it's me, but i've noticed the HDR&gt;HDR path it isn't the right path, then when i connect HDR&gt;HDR output to EmbryoViz it doesn't crash (or display the bleeding window) but display this error baloon:\n\n1. Path must be a valid location\n\n\n\nat this point i suppose (it's only a beginner user opinion) it could be the wrong output path the real problem?\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/MjUiWVyv*JJLM8mXD7UzU3UrvCaGPMp1kVqwwFPPe7AlE4iMCukX1qfy4PmDrVer3MthNfKm2E*RMNl*gzbcr-8q9t27VQEj/Cattura.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/MjUiWVyv*JJLM8mXD7UzU3UrvCaGPMp1kVqwwFPPe7AlE4iMCukX1qfy4PmDrVer3MthNfKm2E*RMNl*gzbcr-8q9t27VQEj/Cattura.PNG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Luciano", "created_at": "May 28, 2014 at 08:19AM", "created_by": "Ambrosinus", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1079412", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1079455"}
