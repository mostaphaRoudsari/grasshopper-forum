{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nWe're running a simple box model using HB to size some window shades for a multifamily residential project in Washington, DC. \u00a0Specifically we're looking the model's peak cooling load to determine the amount of solar load we can shave off with the addition of exterior shading. \u00a0We noticed that peak cooling was occurring at night in autumn and dug a little deeper. \u00a0We found the following peak load components:\n\n\n\n1. Lighting 1.04 w/sf (ok)\n\n2. Equipment 0.5 w/sf (ok)\n\n3. People 0.43 w/sf (ok)\n\n4. Infiltation 0.5 w/sf (ok)\n\n5. Opaque conduction -.08 w/sf\n\n6. Glazing conduction - 0.2 w/sf\n\n7. Outside Air 3.6 w/sf (very high)\n\n8. Outside air temp @ peak \u00a074F (DB), 72F (WB)\n\n\n\nIt appears default outside air loads are creating the equivalent of laboratory equipment cooling loads in our sapce. \u00a0We've disconnected all ventilation inputs from the _HBZones component to reduce the amount of outdoor air introduced to the space and are still finding very high OA loads. \u00a0Has anyone experienced similarly high OA loads or knows of opportunities to adjust this default? \u00a0Obviously it's throwing our studies off...\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nColin\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Colin Schless", "created_at": "March 16, 2016 at 3:37pm", "created_by": "ColinSchless", "topic": "E+ Peak Load / High Default Outside Air", "id": "topic_1486519"}
