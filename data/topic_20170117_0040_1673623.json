{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI recently found out that Ladybug had implemented the PV:surface / Sandia model in Ladybug, which is great.\n\n\n\nNow some questions:\n\n-Can you add surfaces that will cast shading on the PV surfaces? I can't find that.\n\n-Also, the outputs seems strange. When I look at the annual irradiation level, it is, let's say, 1000 kWh/m2 which seems fine according to the climate file (Copenhagen). Then, when I look at the power generated by the system, it is around 1/20th of what I would expect. Also the system size as showed in the result is around 1/20th of what it should be. Anyone has had problems with this?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1673622", "name": "test_PV.gh"}], "created_by_name": "jkanters", "created_at": "January 17, 2017 at 12:40AM", "created_by": "JouriKanters", "topic": "PV:surface", "id": "topic_1673623"}
