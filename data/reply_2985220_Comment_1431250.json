{"body": "\nHi Lhor,\n\nYour file works fine on my machine. The error seems to be because of an old EP library on your system. I updated your file. Can you open the file and see if it works fine?\n\n\n\nIn case it gave you the same error. Close Grasshopper and Rhino and follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to Ladybug working folder. You can find it from the output of Ladybug_ladybug component.\n\n2. There should be a file named \"OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf\". Open the file with any text editor and see if the first line is\u00a0! {\"version\" : \"2015.11.02.02.00\"}\n\n3. If the first line is the same attach the file to this discussion so I can give it a try.\n\n4. Otherwise delete the file and open Rhino and Grasshopper and run your file. It should download an updated version of idf file which should solve the problem.\n\n\n\nOne request! Please choose an appropriate topic for your discussions. \"Error again\" is not the most informative option! Here is a good read about how to ask a good question: ([http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)).\n\n\n\nFor a person who has started Grasshopper two weeks ago you had a great progress.
