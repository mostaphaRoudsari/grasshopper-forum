{"body": "\nHi Giulio,\n\nIt works perfect now after I did many adjustments last night, and I figured out that's a very simple issue.\n\nWhen right click on \"component tab\" -&gt; creat layout ( i want re-arrange all the components) and save it -&gt; it works well, then i close and restart rhino + GH, LB+HB dont show their components. I must delete my personal layout, leave it as default one and now it's OK.\n\nSo the problem here is made by user ( myself) not by software, then I am sorry for that annoying issue.\n\nI am really appreciate all your supports.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nsteve DO\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "steveDO", "created_at": "July 21, 2015 at 08:05PM", "created_by": "dodangtuat", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1329394", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1330155"}
