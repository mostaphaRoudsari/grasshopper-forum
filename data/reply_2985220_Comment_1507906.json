{"body": "\nI talked to Olesen.\n\nHe said, that you determine if the wall/ceiling is cold/hot by comparing it's temperature with the air of the room. If it has a higher temperature than the air's, you should use the equation for hot wall/ceiling and vice versa. He also said that there is no equation for radiant asymmetry for the floor. The local discomfort caused by it, is purely based on contact, like if you touch the floor. That is why there are an equation for if you sit/lie on the floor. I hope that it answers your questions Chris.\n\n\n\nI haven't had the time to examine the components yet. When I have, I will return with some feedback.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Kongsgaard", "created_at": "April 13, 2016 at 8:19am", "created_by": "ChristianKongsgaard", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1503886", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1507906"}
