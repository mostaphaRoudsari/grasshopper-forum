{"body": "\nHi Olivier,\n\n\n\nLooks like an interesting project. What material is your structure made up of? Is it translucent? It's hard for me to tell from your figure, but do you have toplighting as well? The best way in Radiance to ensure that you are only considering direct solar radiation is to do a zero reflectance, zero bounce simulation. [(At least that is how it is in the 5 Phase method)](https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/Tutorial-FivePhaseMethod_v2.pdf).\n\n\n\nAs far as your errors on HB are concerned, it might be easier to figure out what went wrong if you can share your gh file as well.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "September 2, 2016 at 8:22am", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1592168", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1592710"}
