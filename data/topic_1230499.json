A university pavilion. Right now we are\u00a0at the design development phase and since the begging we are using LB and HB for\u00a0daylight analysis. One special condition\u00a0of the project is a concave south\u00a0west glass fa\u00e7ade (north America) that will, for sure, create some solar heat gain because its concentrating solar light on a specific area on the ground.\n\nUsing LB we are able to pin point the location of the sunrays hitting the ground after being reflected by the facade\u00a0and with HB we can\u00a0spot potential glare areas. But Now we need to know if this solar heat gain\u00a0concentrated by the concave facade will create uncomfortable areas on the ground.\n\nIs there a way that I can measure temperature on a given surface that is heated by reflected solar rays or simulate (using LB comfort components) if a person standing on the sunlit area will suffer from the solar heat gain because of that fa\u00e7ade.\n\nPlease see image bellow for graphical explanation\n\n\n\nThank you all\n\n\n\ncheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "February 23, 2015 at 9:00pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "Surface Temperature under reflected solar heat gain", "id": "topic_1230499"}
