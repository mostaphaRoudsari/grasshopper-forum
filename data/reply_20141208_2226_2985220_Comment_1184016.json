{"body": "\nHi Dimitrios, I will check your files tomorrow night as it is getting so late for tonight but just checking the image, Ladybug should not be used for interior analysis as you can read in component's description.\n\nThis component allows you to calculate the radiation fallin on input _geometry using a sky matrix from the selectSkyMxt component.\u00a0This type of radiation sutdy is useful for building surfaces such as windows, where you might be interested in solar heat gain, or solar panels, where you might be interested in the energy that can be collected.<br/>This component is also good for surfaces representing outdoor spaces (such as parks or seating areas) where radiation could affect thermal comfort or vegetation growth.<br/>No reflection of sunlight is included in the radiation analysis with this component and **it should therefore be used\u00a0neither for interior daylight studies nor for complex geometries nor for surfaces with high a reflectivity.\u00a0For these situations where the relfection of light is important, the Honeybee daylight components should be used instead of this one.**\n\n\n\nLadybug results will be totally wrong for any interior condition. If you have defined a material for glazing then Honeybee will give you lower values, but again this is not something that you want to compare. If you are looking for comparative studies you should do it on external surfaces.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 08, 2014 at 10:26PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1183679", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184016"}
