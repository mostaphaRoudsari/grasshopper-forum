{"body": "\nHi, I'm trying to get geometry from Grasshopper to IES using Grizzly Bear and gbXML.\u00a0\n\nMy problem is that Rhino crashes when I try exporting more than 70-100 Volumes.\u00a0\n\nFile attached with release HB 0.0.59, LB 0.0.62\n\nI've tried the last releases except 0.60 since this problem appears.<br/>[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/grizzlybear...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/grizzlybear-error)\n\nAnother note is that IES don't seem to be able to import constructions if the Id is more than 7 char. But I guess that's an IES problem and not a Grizzly problem.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDoes anyone have a solution to this? Or a better way of getting geometry with construction ID to IES.\n\nThanks\n\nOscar\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1622852", "name": "Grizzly Export 125 boxes.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Oscar Borgstrom", "created_at": "October 21, 2016 at 9:26am", "created_by": "OscarBorgstrom", "topic": "Grizzly Bear Crash.", "id": "topic_1622853"}
