{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI was reading your paper 2 days ago by the time I had to simulate an extremely heavy model (because of some panels). I tried to follow the method but I cannot seem to get to the end of it.\u00a0\n\nI don't really understand how you are creating the HDR image (in the end I did a radiance ImageBasedSimulation of the pattern to create an HDR). Also after getting the HDR and creating a .msh of the geometry I want to apply the pattern on, I dont get the effect that I wish.\n\n\n\nI tried adding the material directly into the .rad file, which didnt work, and then by using the additionalRadFiles from the Honeybee component.\n\n\n\nIs there any other place where you have documented this procedure or can you suggest some reference? I search a bit on Radiance man pages about mesh painting but it was not very informative.\u00a0\n\n\n\nthank you very much.\n\n\n\nkind regards,\n\nByron\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "byron mardas", "created_at": "December 4, 2015 at 4:49am", "created_by": "byronmardas", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1431038", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1414773"}
