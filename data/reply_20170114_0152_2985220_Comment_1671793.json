{"body": "\nThanks Chris!!!\n\nI was getting crazy with this. Specially since i built the polylines in Autocad and imported. Now i see that one of them had a \"double line\".\n\nMay i ask another one for the same case? From the HB_readTHERM i expected to get the uValues for the 4 boundary curves i defined in the input (I changed the input tags to List type, and now back to item, if you use the same fixed file). Instead i get only one of them (the frame). For some reason Therm don't get the other 3 boundary curves.\n\nThanks again,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 14, 2017 at 01:52AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1671773", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1671793"}
