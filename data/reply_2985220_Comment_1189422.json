{"body": "\nI'm a bit confused. When I use a Rhino surface to generate a grid of test points, doesn't it run a hemispheric sampling automatically at every test point, with the hemisphere oriented normal to the overall surface?\n\nI'm curious if I can just run the same mesh surface flipped, then combine the two additively (its being measured in lux).\u00a0\n\n\n\nGregs answer was way over my head. The radiance syntax isn't familiar to me, not to mention my lack of instinct for radial geometry (I'm an architect... i like pictures).\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "will krzymowski", "created_at": "December 16, 2014 at 12:51pm", "created_by": "willkrzymowski", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1188792", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1189422"}
