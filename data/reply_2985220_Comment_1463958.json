{"body": "\nElly,\n\nI am so sorry for such a late reply on this. \u00a0I got swept up in the last stable release before I could respond to you and I had forgotten about your issue until now.\n\nThe problem was that the Honeybee scheduleToValues function had not been written to deal with the Compact schedules that you are using in your userCustomEPLibrary. \u00a0There are no Compact schedules like this in the OpenStudio Library and so it seems that it did not become an issue until now. \u00a0I just added the ability to read these types of schedules into the function:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/9ac404e24657854...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/9ac404e246578542f4c8c05f94114dc8e1ad1412)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNg-R9*DkwV1ulR*dfZ20gENp6B514Rmyl0YsNOF5RqtwPa2M4R4ULxFRld*kCq3fGdNGcirQLqHiNj1TWMYTH4g/CompactScheduleSupport.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNg-R9*DkwV1ulR*dfZ20gENp6B514Rmyl0YsNOF5RqtwPa2M4R4ULxFRld*kCq3fGdNGcirQLqHiNj1TWMYTH4g/CompactScheduleSupport.JPG)\n\n\n\nLet me know if everything in the attached GH file is working for you when you get the chance.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1463959", "name": "CompactScheduleSupport_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 15, 2016 at 8:49pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1443615", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463958"}
