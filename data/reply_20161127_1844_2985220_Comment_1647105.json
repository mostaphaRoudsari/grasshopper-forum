{"body": "Abraham,\n\nThanks for the clarification. Yes, there should never be a need to split the windows in two. You use the HBObjWShade if the component produces them and, if not, you plug the shade geometry in as context surfaces.\n\nThe slat angle is included in the component (that is what the \"angle\" input refers to). However, I did not include the ability to schedule a dynamic slat angle as the component was already so large and I had doubts about whether this feature would be used. I can work it in if there's demand for it.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 27, 2016 at 06:44PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1645746", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647105"}
