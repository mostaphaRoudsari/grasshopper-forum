{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nSince the last stable release, I have discontinued the radiant temperature map component. \u00a0This is mostly because it was calculating a thermal map based only on the radiant environment (leaving out air temperature) and, as such, I did not want people thinking that it was a representation of the complete thermal environment according to EnergyPlus.\n\nSince then, I have replaced this radiant component with a complete thermal comfort map workflow and you can get all of the components to build these complete maps by syncing with the github. \u00a0You can find an updated example file for these thermal comfort maps here:\n\n[https://app.box.com/s/11abiyglfuaigd3tay85hqtbzi2iymue](https://app.box.com/s/11abiyglfuaigd3tay85hqtbzi2iymue)\n\nThis discussion has the most recent documentation on how the maps are calculated and this is where I will post my full thesis document once I get the text in a bit better shape:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/initial-doc...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/initial-documentation-of-thermal-maps)\n\nPlease post any questions that you have about the thermal map calculation there.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 26, 2015 at 06:34PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1294117", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1295768"}
