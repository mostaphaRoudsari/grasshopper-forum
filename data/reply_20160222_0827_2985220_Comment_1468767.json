{"body": "\nDude! I go away for the weekend and wham!\n\nThank you very much I will be testing this shortly.\n\n\n\nFYI, the model is indeed for a comfort analysis as it relates to a small diameter duct system we are prototyping and testing in a laboratory. We are going to create a rather complex airflow network looking into air distribution over a wide range of climates and what not. I personally prefer to use Rhino and Python wherever possible and greatly appreciate your work.\n\n\n\nThanks and I will probably be posting other questions soon!\n\n-Rob\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Robert Beach", "created_at": "February 22, 2016 at 08:27AM", "created_by": "RobertBeach", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1468190", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1468767"}
