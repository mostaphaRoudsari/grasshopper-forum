{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nThe radiation analyses give me the sum of the whole year radiation in a given point of the surface which is being analyzed. Is it possible to get the hourly value in each point of the grid instead?\n\n\n\nI need to design a shading system according to the radiation values.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you in advance. I've attached the script.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1744911", "name": "SUNANALYSES.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1744912", "name": "SUNANALYSES.gh"}], "created_by_name": "thidsf", "created_at": "May 3, 2017 at 5:19am", "created_by": "thidsf", "topic": "Hourly radiation value in the surface", "id": "topic_1744913"}
