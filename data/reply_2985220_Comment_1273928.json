{"body": "\nHi Patrick,\n\nDepends on what are you trying to do. EP_ContextSrfs and Honeybee_CreateHBSrfs can be very similar if you use them to set-up a daylighting model. You only need to use ContextSrfs component if you want to set up an energy simulation and assign shadings with transmittance schedule.\n\nI assume you are getting a warning and not an error. You can disregard the warning.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 26, 2015 at 11:30pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1271549", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1273928"}
