{"body": "\nI'm using Windows 7 professional. I'm using Honeybee mainly for daylighting, I have used it for energy simulation but not extensively. They both work (daylighting and energy) with some exceptions like the convert HDR-GIF or HDR-HDR and watch the sky.\n\nI copied the code from the HDR-GIF and watch the sky components that you sent me in your file and overwrote the components that I can download directly from this site, so those work now. However, I don't know how to modify the code when I come across another component that has the same problem in my computer.\n\n\n\nPlease advice! Thank you!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Helena Zambrano", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 4:27pm", "created_by": "HelenaZambrano", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435153", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448642"}
