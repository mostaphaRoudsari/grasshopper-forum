{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI was working through an automated slider run of a radiance illuminance analysis. It was running over night and was stopped for a reason I am not sure of, potentially a forced restart by windows. Now I cannot get radiance to complete a run and the octree is not being generated. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Rhino, Grasshopper, Honeybee/Ladybug, and radiance to no avail. Any ideas? Screenshot of the error below. It was running fine...Won't run on even the simplest of models. Thanks.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1269398", "name": "octree error.docx"}], "created_by_name": "Ed Clark", "created_at": "April 22, 2015 at 4:20am", "created_by": "EdClark", "topic": "Octree erroe", "id": "topic_1269399"}
