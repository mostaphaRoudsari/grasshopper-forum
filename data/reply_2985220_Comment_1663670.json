{"body": "\nHello Sarith,\n\n\n\nIt's nearly one year after your original post and I have been trying out Honeybee's electric lighting analysis. I agree with what has been said by one of the posters that Honeybee may be a \"game changer\" regarding lighting simulations and analysis. To harness the power of Grasshopper, the flexibility of Rhino in a lighting specific application is, I believe, already the future.\n\nBecause of the above I am a big proponent of Honeybee for the professional environment, but I feel that there are still a few shortcomings... from what I have tried.\n\n1. It should be \"photometrically\" more comprehensive, not just for illuminance, luminance and energy (W.h). Other quantities are of great importance, namely intensity and flux.\n\n2. Producing documentation is a big advantage (if not the main advantage) of dedicated packages such as Dialux or AGI32, it would be nice to see it as a strong feature in Honeybee as well.\n\n3. Support for Eulumdat would be a nice feature.\n\n4. There is a performance issue with multiple sources as you mentioned. I have tried a \"simple\" analysis with 120 sources and it takes, indeed, a substantial amount of time to produce the result. Don't know where the bottleneck is, perhaps not Honeybee's to blame, but it is a hindrance in using the software for complex simulations.\n\n5. Material/surface design would benefit from more options.\n\n\n\nFinally, do you have a roadmap of sorts and what can the users expect from Honeybee electic lighting in 2017?\n\nHave a great year!! All the best.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aristo Compasso", "created_at": "December 28, 2016 at 8:28am", "created_by": "AristoCompasso", "parent_id": "topic_1438108", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1663670"}
