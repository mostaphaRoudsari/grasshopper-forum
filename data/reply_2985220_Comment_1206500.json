{"body": "\nHi Francesco,\n\n\n\nThis is a known bug that I thought we have fixed but apparently it is not fixed yet ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/62](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/62)). Thank you for reporting.\n\n\n\nThe answer is that it depends on how you generate the sky. If the sky is selected for an HOY then the values will be in wh/m2, otherwise the values are in Kwh/m2. Based on your image and the values I guess that you're generating an annual sky and so Kwh/m2 is correct.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 18, 2015 at 7:02pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1206133", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1206500"}
