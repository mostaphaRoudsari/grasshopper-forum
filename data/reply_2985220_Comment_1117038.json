{"body": "\nHi guys.\n\nI haven't been able to find the time to get the videos and edit them and probably won't find a time that soon. If anybody on the list is willing to edit the videos so I can upload them let me know and we will find a way to send them the files.\n\nThe good news is that we will give another presentation on 21st. It won't be as comprehensive as the workshop but it should be good to get you started and give an idea about the process.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 15, 2014 at 4:59pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1116765", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1117038"}
