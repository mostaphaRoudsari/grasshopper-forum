{"body": "\nAlejandro,\n\n\n\nSorry for the late response. To answer your questions:\n\n\n\n1. Yes, the two examples that I posted here consider the effect of sun/shade on the outdoor surface temperaturess through the EnergyPlus/ OpenStudio simulation. EnergyPlus computes the percentage of each surface that sees the sun at the different hours of the day and factors this into a dynamic energy balance calculation. Any context or zone geometry will block the sun to surfaces in the EnergyPlus calculation. However, you should note that surface temperatures will only be computed for zone geometries.\n\n\n\n2. If you break up the roof of the ground zone into multiple surfaces, you will get separate temperature results for each surface. This allows you to account for the thermal diversity of different areas in sun/shade. The more surfaces that you break up the roof into, the more accurate your simulation and the longer your calculation time. \u00a0You will see that both examples that I have posted involve breaking up the roof of the ground zone into multiple surfaces.\n\n\n\nFinally, I see that you asked about sky temperature in your original question and you should know that this will automatically be computed in the comfort maps using the shortwave and longwave radiation in the EPW file.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 5, 2016 at 5:21am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1631120", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1633661"}
