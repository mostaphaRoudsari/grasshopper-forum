{"body": "\nChristian,\n\nThat's a very good question that I have also wanted to know the answer to for some time. \u00a0The only thing that I know might get close to addressing your issue is modeling insulated blinds with a dynamic schedule:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5su4fxPuQsr--ktKujtc1VW8djD5RCCtLdkj*GxEjfilvMlm7lN0j9H7AiSQ7Cs8DPJCL6uLWTZh8YSUvTHn1UC3MpiQd7bH/DynamicInsulatedBlinds.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5su4fxPuQsr--ktKujtc1VW8djD5RCCtLdkj*GxEjfilvMlm7lN0j9H7AiSQ7Cs8DPJCL6uLWTZh8YSUvTHn1UC3MpiQd7bH/DynamicInsulatedBlinds.JPG)\n\nFor just modulating the U-Value of a typical wall or window construction, it seems like you will have to go with the intense EMS option that Jeremy mentions on Mostapha's unmet-hours post. \u00a0I have wanted such a feature to help me more accurately model operable windows that are in an open vs closed state. \u00a0If I end up developing anything to help with an EMS workflow like this, I will let you know.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 13, 2015 at 01:50PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1419197", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1420783"}
