{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nTo clarify my comments, the fix that I made here still ensures results that are in line with ASHRAE 55 PMV Standard. \u00a0As such, I think it is a bit unnecessary to alert people to the exact method by which the PMV values are reached since the calculation is considered valid by a large scientific consensus and by ASHRAE. \u00a0The slight difference in methodology seems to have to do more with historical reasons for how the PMV model was developed and the fact that the human body takes a while to reach equilibrium when in conditions of high wind.\n\nTo clarify further, an iterative method is used to calculate PMV any time that the wind speed is above\u00a00.15 m/s. \u00a0The original published PMV model was done in climate chambers and was made to describe indoor environments where wind speeds above this were uncommon. \u00a0As people began to adapt the PMV model to help understand outdoor conditions and to develop OUT_SET, an iterative methodology was developed to help calculate values in conditions of high outdoor wind.\n\nLet me know if this is clear,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 2, 2015 at 1:31pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1234946", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1234967"}
