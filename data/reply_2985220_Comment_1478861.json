{"body": "\nKraakie,\n\nThere is something that sounds me suspicious about the requirements you wrote above.\n\nBelow 10C you set the temp to 20-24 (which is heating).\n\nAbove 10C you set the temp to 23-26 (which is also heating? Or cooling?)\n\n\n\nWhat if you have 20C? You need to heat to 24-26?\n\nWhat if you have 28? Then you cool to 24-26?\n\n\n\nSomething is missing here ...\n\nOr am i wrong? (In this case i don't understand the logic).\n\n\n\nBesides that, you are simulating 3 zones instead of 1. Your conncetions of all the HB_setEPZoneSchedules to the HB_setEPIdealAir is causing this. Messy ... a little bit.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 7, 2016 at 3:50am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1478781", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1478861"}
