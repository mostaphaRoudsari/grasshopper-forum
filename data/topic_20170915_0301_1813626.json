{"body": "\nHello guys, I after a year of working with other tools I want to restart learning LBandHB legacy versions.\u00a0\n\nI have updated Honeybee lagacy from 0.056 to the latest version available, and \u00a0I am currently trying to launch a simple energy analysis, using new components: as shown in the picture I can't find similar HB components for HB_runenergysimulation.\n\nProbably after almost 2 years there are new components that i don't know, and before opening this discussion I have been searching for a while, but I haven't found anything. Could someone help me ?\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhich are the correct actions to let \"update LB and HB component\" \u00a0work \u00a0?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1813625", "name": "Immagine.png"}], "created_by_name": "lukanuts", "created_at": "September 15, 2017 at 03:01AM", "created_by": "lukanuts", "topic": "Honeybee RunEnergySimulation component", "id": "topic_1813626"}
