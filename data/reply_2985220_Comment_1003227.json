{"body": "\nHi Saeran and thanks,\n\nI've been testing your components. So first of all: Thanks for sharing!!\n\nA big difference i see between your components and Chris's is the definition of the period. Chris allows free months/hours while yours are constrained to a specific day (21.9), allowing only to change the amount of exposed hours. Did i get it right?\n\nComparing with DIVA, your Fan is (kind of) similar, but the big change happens in the Envelope. You set the same date for both components, while in DIVA the Envelope is set for 21.12 (assuming that my previous statement is right).\n\nPersonally i find Chris's more flexible to changing situations related to checking periods. Some places may require different conditions.\n\nI'm attaching a GH comparing yours with DIVA. I'm using there the LB ViewFromSun component to check the compliance to the hours i said before.\n\n\n\nAs for some bugs i've found:The Location input for the Envelope is not working (though in your example it does). I get this error: 1. Solution exception:name 'FL' is not defined. Out of that seems to be working well.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1003228", "name": "solarFan_solarExtrusions_2_A.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1003229", "name": "solarFan_solarExtrusions_2_A.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 5, 2014 at 1:12am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1002978", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1003227"}
