{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI'd like to start a discussion, or general questions in regrades to the use of simple models for daylighting analysis. Where we understand that thermal models do not require the thickness of the wall to be modelled geometrically, as the thickness is defined through the construction we assigned via E+, what is the approach for Honeybee with daylighting?\n\n\n\nUsing a simple, architectural sketch model for thermal analysis cannot be used for daylighting analysis for high levels of accuracy due to the lack of wall thickness and modelling of mullions.\n\n\n\nWould you all suggest then some form of \"shading\" to be scripted to fit the outline of each window to mimic the presence of a wall thickness which would have an effect on the light distribution within the space? How should this be treated within Honeybee for quick and reliable simulations?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "October 05, 2015 at 08:41PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Discussion: Accuracy of Daylight simulations with no wall thickness?", "id": "topic_1373939"}
