{"body": "\nThank you for the list. Such lists can be really helpful. We don't have any at the moment. Honeybee[+] is trying to address some of the items in your checklist specially for the results visualization. Automating some of the items is going to be hard as we don't have all the information that we need. For instance how do we know if there is a ground plane? At the same time we can create components to help the users to take care of the cases. For instance have a component/option that adds the ground plane to the scene. There is a lot that we can do in that area. To me that's a turning point once we can include the best practice into the workflow.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 29, 2017 at 9:34am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1679849", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1680358"}
