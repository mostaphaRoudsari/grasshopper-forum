It's currently 1, 2 and 3. In your file, you were setting up a parallel run which is quite picky for vertical views.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7AULtQmLSn0XAgu15PtlleGZIyyEfAHedUjm5IaTt0bblIaxjpIZV-n3TNCZDF7MwbFZdxgYqST5SRVKnNtZsOcIVSA1Hg4V/ValueList.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/7AULtQmLSn0XAgu15PtlleGZIyyEfAHedUjm5IaTt0bblIaxjpIZV-n3TNCZDF7MwbFZdxgYqST5SRVKnNtZsOcIVSA1Hg4V/ValueList.PNG)\n\nStill, we need to add a log to init component to give a more meaningful error message.\n\n\n\nFinally, you need to pick higher values for -ar and lower values for -aa for your analysis. It's not only about the number of bounces.
