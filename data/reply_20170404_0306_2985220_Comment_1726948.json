{"body": "\nHi,\n\nProbably Sarith is right.\n\nThe only reason i can think about of internalizing the data is to transfer it to someone else. Otherwise i'm not sure it makes much sense. My understanding is that the genCumSky creates the mtx files the FIRST time it was asked for, for the EPW. It checks if those files exist already. If so, it only reads them (which takes some time because they are big files), if no it calculates them.\n\nSo, just for my curiosity, why you want to internalize them, Ji?\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 04, 2017 at 03:06AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726887", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726948"}
