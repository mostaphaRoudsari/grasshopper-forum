{"body": "\nHi everybody\n\nI have a problem with my analysis. I want to analyze the floor of an interior room in a building for radiation and daylight autonomy. Radiation comes from energy and the unit is kwh/m2. So energyplus should analyze this, and I need to model my building with all of the thicknesses of interior walls and exterior walls. And I should give EP materials to my model. Am I right?\n\nAnd for Daylight Autonomy analysis I need to give RAD materials to my model. So for this analysis Do I need to give the thicknesses of interior walls and exterior walls?\n\nI want to know the difference between the results from radiation analysis with thicknesses of walls and ceilings and floors and the results from radiation analysis without thickness...\n\nI don't know where I am wrong!!\n\nIf you know anything about this please help me\n\nthanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "leila pasandi", "created_at": "November 15, 2016 at 12:51pm", "created_by": "leilapasandi", "topic": "radiation and daylight analysis", "id": "topic_1640061"}
