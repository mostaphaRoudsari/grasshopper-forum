{"body": "\nHi Mostapha\n\n\n\nThe daylight savings cluster I made is just a simple dispatch with a Boolean input. If true, it adds an extra hour to the timezone.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs for the missing vector, I actually need to calculate the no. of hours of direct sunlight on a facade within a given period. So I believe for the calculations to work, I need this extra vector. It's pretty easy to do a workaround by adding an extra hour in the input and then splitting the output lists. I just want to check if there was some logic behind your methodology I was missing before I went ahead an amended it.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/*E1*lxSss-cRzUvmLSem5Ktv9Cm9QPE*oPjVrnj2pBt3csjXOMdqUUvuC1AqR0n3QqV0K9sXqzYfF3rWTkou6Z*zIWMLEC5c/Location.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/*E1*lxSss-cRzUvmLSem5Ktv9Cm9QPE*oPjVrnj2pBt3csjXOMdqUUvuC1AqR0n3QqV0K9sXqzYfF3rWTkou6Z*zIWMLEC5c/Location.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul Wintour", "created_at": "January 12, 2015 at 5:25pm", "created_by": "PaulWintour", "parent_id": "topic_1202845", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1203443"}
