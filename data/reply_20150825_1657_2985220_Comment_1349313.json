{"body": "\nI've run some tests and everything seems like the way it should behave in real life =) There is one thing that I could not quite make it work and that is the honeybee convert hdr to gif component.\n\nIf I switch the option to false it works, but if I switch the option to true (which is what I want in the end) the image being generated has a file size of 0 kb. I looked in the code and found the rad_gif.exe from radiance is doing the converting(?). Maybe the issues lies there I'm not sure.\n\nThe weird thing is that sometimes it works and I get an adjusted exposure image, but for the majority it fails.\u00a0\n\nWe should have the analysis within the next two weeks, I'll post some findings here.\n\nCheers!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/v4ZZJy3ZUOc7QdOceOfXeLLqTdwoQuQSgIGfBHBUD8W87V*IF0P9FPivyJvzNnlEN6dZ0ypy4*DlXURj2mLJ8DAGdnRSdQJh/false.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/v4ZZJy3ZUOc7QdOceOfXeLLqTdwoQuQSgIGfBHBUD8W87V*IF0P9FPivyJvzNnlEN6dZ0ypy4*DlXURj2mLJ8DAGdnRSdQJh/false.JPG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/v4ZZJy3ZUOchnwyo3spIHAPQtFlwtfqxmDlJF7YSmGlW2HDqK9vQjRiGVm21v7dN2TPLPhp-Cav5e-3uqs2RhlWJGf2ta5gg/true.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/v4ZZJy3ZUOchnwyo3spIHAPQtFlwtfqxmDlJF7YSmGlW2HDqK9vQjRiGVm21v7dN2TPLPhp-Cav5e-3uqs2RhlWJGf2ta5gg/true.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Arie-Willem de Jongh", "created_at": "August 25, 2015 at 04:57PM", "created_by": "aw", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1347819", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1349313"}
