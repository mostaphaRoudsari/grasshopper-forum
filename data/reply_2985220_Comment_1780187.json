{"body": "\n<br/>Thank you so much [Devang Chauhan](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topic/listForContributor?user=3m8ut2xbfxihd)\u00a0\u00a0and also thanks to [Omid Rashidi](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topic/listForContributor?user=0gp7w06zkdwrr).<br/>The file created by Devang Chauhan let me starting the analysis, and I could get the files .idf, .bat, .rvaudit but not the files .eio and .csv. Using the program EnergyPlus (the external program, not the Grasshopper plug-in) I could get those files but I still have the two following problems:\n\n1. Your simulation probably did not run correctly.\u00a0<br/>Check the report out of the Run Simulation component to see what severe or fatal errors happened in the simulation.\u00a0<br/>If there are no severe or fatal errors, the issue could just be that there is .eio file adjacent to the .csv _resultFileAddress.\u00a0<br/>Check the folder of the file address you are plugging into this component and make sure that there is both a .csv and .eio file in the folder.\n\n2. No surface information was found in the imported .eio file adjacent to the .csv _resultFileAddress.Data cannot be normalized by surface area and the data tree outputs for surface data will not be grafted by zone.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1780189", "name": "TESTV00.0220170601DB.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1780190", "name": "ITA_Venice.161050_IWEC.epw"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1780191", "name": "THESISV00.0220170619DB.gh"}], "created_by_name": "DAVIDE BAROLO", "created_at": "July 7, 2017 at 7:59am", "created_by": "DAVIDEBAROLO", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1776753", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1780187"}
