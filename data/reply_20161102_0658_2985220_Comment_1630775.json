{"body": "\nHi Mingbo,\n\n\n\nGreat thanks to your immediate reply and patient help. And it really did work.\n\n\n\nAs you said, I simplified the model with more control points by breaking up the form into 6 zones with the air wall between them. Each is made of planner surfaces.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/VQvbBACfG9rmOhagoImB9D2XEqWUsEBqQG7WArV1HhUMe51GD*6KKjJujtkVyPJ6DgrKGmVF6gJj-hR3vrsg7dvLUIkHqDCf/1.png\" width=\"487\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/VQvbBACfG9rmOhagoImB9D2XEqWUsEBqQG7WArV1HhUMe51GD*6KKjJujtkVyPJ6DgrKGmVF6gJj-hR3vrsg7dvLUIkHqDCf/1.png)\n\n\n\nAs you see, I can get the overall energy use values, but the \"severe\" issue still got me a little confused, I lost the surface values. I mean I am glad to have the result and grateful for your kind help. Meanwhile, I just felt curious about this issue. I checked the same issue in the discussion forum, \u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interior-so...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interior-solar-distribution-calculation), like this post.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo my question is, is it still my model's error or should I\u00a0run the simulation without interior reflections using the Energy Simulation Par component? If so, how to handle in the\u00a0Energy Simulation Par component.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/VQvbBACfG9owhdGzj1zsuOYZvetGnBK1nIlPLAwKioBhjKdVxKPdq0ExvAJ-8z6XVo4VTA09rT1CHeSrPCWghFKNCoS2YJip/2.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/VQvbBACfG9owhdGzj1zsuOYZvetGnBK1nIlPLAwKioBhjKdVxKPdq0ExvAJ-8z6XVo4VTA09rT1CHeSrPCWghFKNCoS2YJip/2.png)\n\n\n\nThank you again for your great help.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "November 02, 2016 at 06:58AM", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1630020", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1630775"}
