{"body": "\nHi all,\u00a0\n\nI am running a thermal comfort assessment in a room with a high level of glazing. I am trying to assess the effect of the windows G-value (or SHGC) on the thermal comfort annually.\n\nHowever, as I change the G-value of the window the annual PPD in the room stays unchanged, which does not make much sense to me. Can someone think of a likely explanation to this?\n\nRegards,\n\nAlejandro\n\nGH definition attached\n\n[shgc%20windows.gh](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3pbaBKayUO-7*oki0lNrc9p4Q6r7zHXoy9huo90Kn4wSQqHrSFmu645rdHJ4PxSpMe2DUhIRynV4ku8xT1WTmPiCy25GZf0S/shgcwindows.gh)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183290", "name": "shgc windows.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "December 08, 2014 at 05:01AM", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Thermal comfort depending on the G-value of the windows", "id": "topic_1183291"}
