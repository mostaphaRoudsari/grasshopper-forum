{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nI just realized that the wind direction input in the definition was completely wrong. I was actually rotating the wind tunnel which does nothing since the wind is always considered in relation to the input geometry.\n\n\n\nThe following definition should do the job. I also updated the tool-tip to represent the change and logic of wind direction in a wind tunnel. Finally, the location in mesh should be ok now and will work for any Brep input.\n\n\n\nKind regars,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1588360", "name": "160825_ButterflyHumanUI_OutdoorCFD_AY_TG.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "August 25, 2016 at 4:01am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1587719", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1588359"}
