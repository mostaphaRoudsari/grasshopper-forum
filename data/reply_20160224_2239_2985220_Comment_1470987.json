{"body": "\nStefina,\n\nUsing your file, I was able to replicate the crash on my machine. \u00a0My initial guess is that it has something to do with the fact that you are connecting up 207 zones and Rhino might be throwing exceptions when it sees the memory use growing so fast (I know that such fast memory use is typically an indication of an infinite loop). \u00a0This really seems like an issue on McNeel's end but we might be able to mitigate this in the meantime.\n\nI can at least tell you that, if you build the model up floor-by-floor (with each floor given its own Mass2Zones component), you can build this same model without having Rhino crash:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/rFmq0S5l0CJGXJd9j1tTmNgYsFTmk4k4o3OTzyC25d04u*vhAQb9n2ZWzY2uEtVBZ3HzaEeJj9scOIWcwBsrU-P6faRcvzYl/FloorByFloor.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/rFmq0S5l0CJGXJd9j1tTmNgYsFTmk4k4o3OTzyC25d04u*vhAQb9n2ZWzY2uEtVBZ3HzaEeJj9scOIWcwBsrU-P6faRcvzYl/FloorByFloor.JPG)\n\nFor the time being you can use this method and I will try to look further into it later.\n\nKeep us posted if you find any other ways of building the model without causing the crash. \u00a0I have an inkling that it might also be related to the fact that your starting geometry is not completely planar. \u00a0I would recommend planarizing the geometry if get the chance. \u00a0This will minimize the amount of memory use, at least.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1470989", "name": "MASSINGGENERAL2_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 24, 2016 at 10:39PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1470966", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1470987"}
