{"body": "\nASE, as described in IES\u00a0 LM 83-12, is supposed to be calculated considering direct sun contribution only. Which roughly translates to an -ab 0 (ie 0 bounce) calculation in Radiance/Daysim. It is assumed that a 1000 lux measurement for a particular hour on a workplane grid point will indicate a illuminance from direct sun at that point. If I remember correctly, these simulations are to be run without the presence of any shading devices.\n\n\n\nFrom an ASE calculation perspective, there are several shortcomings within Daysim (as it exists right now). The daylight coefficient method, which Daysim employs, calculates illuminance by dividing the sky into discrete patches. ([http://naturalfrequency.com/wiki/sky-subdivision](http://naturalfrequency.com/wiki/sky-subdivision)) For a clear sky with sun, the luminance from sun is accounted for by approximating the position of sun into 3 (as far as I know) patches. That in turn leads to an incorrect estimation of both position and luminance contribution of the sun.\n\n\n\nAnyways, as I wrote in the begining, in my opinion the closest you'd get to calculating ASE from daysim right now would be running an annual daylighting calculation with Honeybee by setting ambient bounces as zero. A better approach, in case you are not trying to comply with something like leed v4, would be to do a DGP analysis as Chris mentioned in his post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "November 14, 2015 at 01:27AM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1400028", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1400180"}
