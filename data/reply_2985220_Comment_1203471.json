{"body": "\nHi Ilona,\n\nI'm glad that your issue was worked out. \u00a0It seems that it had something to do with E+ not outputting an eio file with surface information in it (from what I can tell). \u00a0 Whatever it is, I am glad that reinstalling fixed it.\n\nFor general informational purposes, those warnings in the panel happen because the \"write EP Result Parameters\" component requests some outputs that are for the OpenStudio VAV and PTHP systems, which E+ does not understand when you are running an ideal air loads system. \u00a0In short, there is no need for concern over those warnings.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 12, 2015 at 11:30pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1198549", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1203471"}
