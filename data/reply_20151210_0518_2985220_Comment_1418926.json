{"body": "\nHi Eli,<br/><br/>could you check if in your computer the files are finally created in this location as I marked in your previous printscreen:<br/>[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Xmum00w8Zd3C6k7unTu9r39GLOuf0zq1LikNlQ-rQjd7G8bf-A8uXhsbQ9ACokOE-KfLLT-CPMlewALJLHciKljO02rM8QmE/Untitled1.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Xmum00w8Zd3C6k7unTu9r39GLOuf0zq1LikNlQ-rQjd7G8bf-A8uXhsbQ9ACokOE-KfLLT-CPMlewALJLHciKljO02rM8QmE/Untitled1.jpg)If that eventually happens after the simulation has finished, I suspect exactly the same cause as in my case...\u00a0<br/><br/>Indeed the way to overcome this is to reference these files manually, providing the path as an input to the next component and enabling it manually after all the cmd windows are closed (otherwise it runs the next component to quickly and therefore does not find the files).<br/><br/>However, in our case we are running an optimization loop, which includes daylight calculations, therefore manual interference is not an option... However, I did not find a way to fix it, so I am simply making the next component \"sleep\" until the files get generated.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rusne Sileryte", "created_at": "December 10, 2015 at 05:18AM", "created_by": "RusneSileryte", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416772", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1418926"}
