{"body": "\nI've used forward tracing to study the effect of a series of reflectors on a west-facing facade, trying to get the limited direct light from that elevation as deeply into a space as possible.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'm now trying to run an annual analysis to get comparative metrics of the reflectors vs nothing vs a light shelf. However, I'm not seeing any difference in results at the moment. I think that my issue is the \"resolution\" of the sky. Is there a way to increase the sky divisions or change the sky matrix for an annual daylight simulation so the reflectors are \"seen\" by the study?\n\n\n\nSample file attached for reference (Ignore the notes on the file, I used a file I made for others as a tutorial as a base.)\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1763280", "name": "Simple CDA Simulation-Embedded.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Jason Smith", "created_at": "June 04, 2017 at 05:16AM", "created_by": "JasonSmith", "topic": "Annual Radiance Study \u2014 Sky \"Resolution\"", "id": "topic_1763281"}
