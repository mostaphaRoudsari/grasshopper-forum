{"body": "\nAngelo,\n\nI found out what the error was. \u00a0Drangonfly_Dragonfly downloads some supporting UWG files in the background to help run the simulation and it seems that github changed its conventions for how to download such supporting files from repositories. \u00a0I have fixed this with these commits to the UWG:\n\n[https://github.com/hansukyang/UWG_Matlab/commit/3f1ca09ce27a1056fab...](https://github.com/hansukyang/UWG_Matlab/commit/3f1ca09ce27a1056fab91cfa8130c3128bc85f2f)\n\nTo get everything fixed on your machine, you should navigate to\u00a0C:\\ladybug and delete the UWG folder there. \u00a0Next, load up the attached script or the updated Hydra example file:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Urban_Weather_Generator_Workflow&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\nThen everything should run fine. Let me know if this fixes everything on your end.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1731053", "name": "UWG_Workflow.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 10, 2017 at 9:41pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1731050", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1731052"}
