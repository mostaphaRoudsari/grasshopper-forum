{"body": "Antonello,\nThis component should definitely be integrated into the code base and you should feel free to send a pull request when you get the chance. I think it might be better to have this component as separate from the sunpath as the sunrise/sunset is at a higher temporal resolution than the typical hourly logic of the sunpath. If anyone has an argument to the contrary, please post here.\n\nAlong the lines of what Abrahm mentions, the current sunpath code is the same as the NOAA code and we verified it in this old github issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/73\nI know that the comments around the solinitoutput code say that the code is from the radiance sunpath but this is outdated and we should erase that comment. Accordingly, it would be great, Antonello, if your component could reference this NOAA function in Ladybug_Ladybug if it is possible. This way, we can avoid having several copies of the same code and together improve the same sunpath function instead of separate incompatible copies.\n\nAlso, I should note that the LB_LB NOAA function has an input for \"year\" but we always set this to the current year as the solar position is fairly constant from year to year and we have yet to encounter someone wanting to see the sun position a millenuim I to the future/past.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 02, 2016 at 05:06PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1452087", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1453306"}
