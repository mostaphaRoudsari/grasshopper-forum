{"body": "\nHi Milan!<br/><br/>Unfortunately I could not find a way to calculate it dynamically (Guess it's not possible), So I calculated the results for different exact times during the day, with a simple number slider for the hours and the rec component for saving and adding the results to compare the two (Dynamic and Static). I did it for different days in different times of the year.I know It was not the most precise calculation but it gave me what I needed for my presentation.<br/><br/>I would still be happy to know if there was a better way to calculate the difference.<br/>Let me know if you found one!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Omid Bakhshaei", "created_at": "February 21, 2017 at 08:25AM", "created_by": "OmidBakhshaei", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1696502", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1696870"}
