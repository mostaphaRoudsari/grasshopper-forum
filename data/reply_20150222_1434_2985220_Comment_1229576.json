{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you for your answer! Indeed setting up the cooling capacity to zero did work. I was also wondering if the wind direction could somehow take into account surrounding obstructions that influence the intensity and distribution of the wind - as happens in an urban environment with adjacent buildings etc! I guess this is also more on the CFD side right?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank!\n\nTasos\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 02:34PM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228579", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1229576"}
