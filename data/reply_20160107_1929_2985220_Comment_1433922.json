{"body": "\nDear Mostapha,\n\nThanks for your help!!!!!!\n\nI have tried 2 options but both of them couldn\u2019t work.\n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Chris said, updating the weather file link cannot work correctly. The error is the same as what I have posted yesterday: WeatherFileURL is not a valid web address to a DOE weather file.\n\n2) \u00a0 \u00a0 I used the downloaded weather file. The remaining problem is that when I was trying to run the Microclimate Map, there is a component named \u2018Ladybug_Import_Stat\u2019 which requires me to feed in \u2018Statfile\u2019. I have checked all the related \u2018import weather file\u2019 component, but cannot find a specific component to open StatFile.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/088*6UBF7TCl2TQhMA08ekHRYUbsbCX*8LObwOYAWewsrm2fXZSUP*v8KtUtevaZC68bloWGj3157mcaS14OHwDGr9V80oZW/1.png?width=200\" width=\"200\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/088*6UBF7TCl2TQhMA08ekHRYUbsbCX*8LObwOYAWewsrm2fXZSUP*v8KtUtevaZC68bloWGj3157mcaS14OHwDGr9V80oZW/1.png)\n\nI tried to link \u2018Open EPW\u2019 component to \u2018Ladybug_Import_Stat\u2019 , but it seems didn\u2019t work (see as below). The pop-out error showed: \u2018Solution exception: index out of range:1\u2019. What's wrong with my operation?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/088*6UBF7TBLV49hmdB7pSHFaxHVWSXxIGYGopeQdyTzE7SdYY2j5H2Y1467Egcb-ZqCKi6v31ac0s9-MmMUaFVJDRnOL2Nw/2.png?width=400\" width=\"400\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/088*6UBF7TBLV49hmdB7pSHFaxHVWSXxIGYGopeQdyTzE7SdYY2j5H2Y1467Egcb-ZqCKi6v31ac0s9-MmMUaFVJDRnOL2Nw/2.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Maria X", "created_at": "January 07, 2016 at 07:29PM", "created_by": "MariaX", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1433812", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1433922"}
