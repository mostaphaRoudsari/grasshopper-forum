{"body": "\nHello Ladybuggers!\n\nWe have just released a new solar Envelope component for Laybug called SolarEnvelopeAdvanced! The component offers two envelopes -\n\nSolar rights - A 3D envelope which defines the maximum height of built volume which would not violate the solar access for defined surroundings given filtered sun vectors.\n\nSolar Collection - A complementary 3D envelope which defines the lowest heights from which a new built volume would receive solar access, given a built context and filtered sun vectors.\n\nThe new component harnesses ladybug's SunPath tool to determine relevant sun positions based on input from an .epw file. The simulation also takes into account surrounding buildings if provided or a self envelope if omitted, with the goal of adding control and flexibility in conjunction with a more accurate simulation. \u00a0\n\n\n\nA video tutorial is available here -\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRtsxgJCVEw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRtsxgJCVEw)\n\nAn example file is both attached and accessible through here \u00a0- [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ao11882no95io9x/solarEnvelopeAdvanced_exa...](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ao11882no95io9x/solarEnvelopeAdvanced_example_file.gh?dl=0)\n\n\n\nThe component takes as an input a filtered list of sun vectors, a base surface which represents the site border and a list of curves, representing the surrounding context\n\n[<img alt=\"top\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3728381/9563440/0a44ec92-4e84-11e5-9e8d-ecb373393c9a.jpg\" width=\"1128\"/>](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3728381/9563440/0a44ec92-4e84-11e5-9e8d-ecb373393c9a.jpg)\n\nand outputs a point cloud and a polysurface -\n\n[<img alt=\"persp\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3728381/9563442/1e2b350e-4e84-11e5-91ea-de521f19d5c9.jpg\" width=\"936\"/>](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3728381/9563442/1e2b350e-4e84-11e5-91ea-de521f19d5c9.jpg)\n\nwhich in turn can be closed and further evaluated (On the left - solar collection, on the right - solar rights) -\u00a0<br/> [<img alt=\"4\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3728381/9563445/2b6fc90a-4e84-11e5-99bc-79e5ee07dea3.jpg\" width=\"738\"/>](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3728381/9563445/2b6fc90a-4e84-11e5-99bc-79e5ee07dea3.jpg)\n\n\n\nBy Boris Plotnikov and with the assistance and guidance of Prof. Guedi Capeluto, based on SustArc model. The component could not have be alive without the invaluable help of the awesome Chris Mackey and Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari in development and integration, also a big thanks is due to Abraham Yezioro for testing and advising on usability.\n\n\n\nFor further reading it might be worth taking a look at Ralph Knowles's work, e.g -[http://www.fau.usp.br/aut5823/Acesso_ao_Sol/Knowles_2003_Solar_Enve...](http://www.fau.usp.br/aut5823/Acesso_ao_Sol/Knowles_2003_Solar_Envelope.pdf)<br/> and G. Capeluto and E. Shaviv's, e.g -\u00a0[http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS1999/BS99_C-22.pdf](http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS1999/BS99_C-22.pdf)<br/> the component relies to a great extend on the concepts described there.\n\nThanks for reading and enjoy!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1351456", "name": "solarEnvelopeAdvanced_example_file.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Boris Plotnikov", "created_at": "August 30, 2015 at 04:26PM", "created_by": "BorisPlotnikov", "topic": "New Solar Envelope Component now available", "id": "topic_1351457"}
