{"body": "\nTim,\n\nTo more specifically address your concern, the December sky that you are getting is not unnatural. \u00a0It is just that you have direct sun coming through your louvers when the sun is low on the horizon in the winter but, when the sun is higher in the sky in the summer, all of the direct sun is being diffused by your louver system, giving much mower illuminance values. Illuminance values above 20,000 lux are very common in the outdoors or when you are in direct sun. \u00a0If you check the \"Global Horizontal Illuminance\" of an EPW file, you will see that the outside light levels can get as high as 100,000 lux in the summer at noon in most climates.\n\nI hope this explanation helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 7, 2015 at 10:09pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1413121", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416804"}
