{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\n\n\nI am trying to run a daylight simulation. Now the zone I am trying to model has a few openings on the periphery. These openings in the wall are not going to be closed with glass(windows). They are going to remain as cut-outs (punctures) in the wall.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIs it ok to use AIRWALL as surface type for those openings in Honeybee_createHBSrfs component?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDevang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "November 12, 2016 at 05:59AM", "created_by": "devang", "topic": "Void (Puncture) in Geometry", "id": "topic_1637772"}
