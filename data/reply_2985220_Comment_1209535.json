{"body": "\nLuciano,\n\nI will also say that, from my research, there is a general consensus that the metric of PMV is not suitable for outdoor comfort analyses. \u00a0At the least, if you use it for outdoor conditions, you cannot use it in the same way that you would for indoor conditions. \u00a0For example, you cannot say that, if PMV is in the range from +/- 1 PMV, at least 80% of people are comfortable. \u00a0It is known that people tolerate much more extreme conditions when they are outdoors and you will frequently find conditions where someone has a PMV of 1.6 or higher but will say that they are\u00a0perfectly\u00a0comfortable. \u00a0Also, the range of adaptability\u00a0with clothing and metabolic rate is much greater in the outdoors than in the indoors and these variables can be hard to guess for outdoor conditions unless you are an expert. \u00a0All that I am saying is to be cautious and critical if you use the PMV method for outdoor conditions.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 22, 2015 at 3:23pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209612", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209535"}
