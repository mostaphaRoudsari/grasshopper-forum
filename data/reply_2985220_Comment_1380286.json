{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThe importIdf component did crash a few times.\n\nAs a workaround, I tried using [eppy library](https://github.com/santoshphilip/eppy) for extracting information from IDF files and then feeding it into a Honeybee/Ladybug workflow. Eppy is a little clunky (and perhaps buggy as well) but does the job most of the times. I have a few IDF files with versions ranging from 8.0 to 8.3 and since there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of backward compatibility in versions, its been a grind trying to get everything in one place..Thanks for the gh file! I will try to write a custom script by expanding it.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "October 16, 2015 at 4:24pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1380202", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1380286"}
