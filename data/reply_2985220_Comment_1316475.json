{"body": "\nThank you. Strange thing now: I got specific data from a company for my window materials. I added them to my *.idf-Mat.-File and successfully ran the simulation. After the third test simulation I got an error report, that vis.Transmittance@normal incidence + Front Side Visible Reflectance at normal Incidence shouldn't be below =1.0. But it's not.\n\nDo you know where this comes from?\n\nThank you very much again,\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1316476", "name": "NRG_SIM_FACADEVF-DG-ARTGLASSAR-20.err"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1316477", "name": "userCustomEPLibrary.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "June 27, 2015 at 10:23am", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1316736", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1316475"}
