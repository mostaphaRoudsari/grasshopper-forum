{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\nThis is a tough one right now. There is no simplified way that I know to calculate such a thing. At least not with Ladybug+Honeybee.\n\nThere are tools like RADTHERM ([http://www.thermoanalytics.com/products/radtherm](http://www.thermoanalytics.com/products/radtherm)) that you can use for such analysis.\n\nI know about an on-going development to model long-wave radiations using Radiance to model situations like this. Meanwhile I don't think you can run such an analysis with Ladybug+Honeybee.\n\nDo you confirm this Chris?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 1, 2015 at 10:35pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1231901", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1234619"}
