{"body": "\nHi, Mostapha,\n\nI did restart my computer and it didn't work. I started with OpenStudio 1.10.0 and it gave me similar error except version in IDF = \"8.4\". So I figured probably I need OpenStudio 1.9.0 and I did install it and uninstalled 1.10.0. So in the warning message, IDF version back to 8.3, but other errors remained.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnother thing to mention is that I used to have EnergyPlus 8.3 and 8.4 both installed and later I uninstalled 8.4.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf it is working in your system, I might just try it on other computers on Monday. My computer is just junk with all kinds of softwares and multiple versions of simulation engines. That is probably the case.\n\nThank you very much!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zilong Tan", "created_at": "January 9, 2016 at 3:20pm", "created_by": "ZilongTan", "parent_id": "topic_1434676", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435446"}
