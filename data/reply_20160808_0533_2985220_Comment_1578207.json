{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n<br/>Running the terrainMask without context gives you the mask with the original sunPath scale.\n\nYes, you are correct: if nothing is inputted into the context_ input, the radius of the final terrainShadingMask output will always be 200 meters (or 655 feets in case of Feet unit system). This corresponds to the default radius of the \"Sunpath\" component (_sunPathScale_ = 1). This geometry is suppose to be used for visualization purposes only.\n\n<br/>There is no need to scale anymore the mask?\n\nYes. No manual scaling should be performed. The \"Terrain shading mask\" component will perform the scaling based on the size of context_ input's bounding box.\n\n\n\nBut here, is one doubt. Say i have a large model or a small one. For the fomer i want the mask to be beyond the limits of the model, so i'll scale it down ...? This won't affect the solar/radiation calculations results (or the other way around: scale up.\n\nThe mask will always be scaled in a way so that it goes beyond the limits of the context_ input. It will never intersect with the context_ input. Unless your context input is consisted of a building blocks, a couple of hundreds of meters in diameter, somewhere high in the mountains: you will probably end up with 10 000 meters mask radius.\n\nI didn't understand you about the affect of the solar radiation results.<br/>You mean: does scaling of the mask affects the solar radiation results?\n\n\n\nPlease let me know without hesitation if I missed to answer some of your questions.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "August 08, 2016 at 05:33AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578243", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578207"}
