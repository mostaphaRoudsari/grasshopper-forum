{"body": "\nHi Nickolaj,\n\n\n\nThe first error can cause large inaccuracies. It's usually a warning for when the direction of glazing surface is not the same as the parent surface. How are you generating the glazing surfaces? A quick way to check which surfaces are causing this issue is to import the idf file into OpenStudio and that will give you a report.\n\n\n\nThe second error is because you have non-convex surfaces in your model. As far as I can see it's not major in your case but you can always split non-convex faces into convex faces by splitting them into convex surfaces.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 4, 2016 at 6:57am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1453516", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1454633"}
