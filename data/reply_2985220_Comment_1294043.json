{"body": "\nHi Saeran, Mostapha, and Chris,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if there is a way of achieving this with Ladybug/Honeybee and Rhino. It seems like an amazing analysis.\n\n\n\nI am going to try native components perhaps but a heads up of do's and dont's would be great!\n\n\n\nIs there some option of creating a 3d grid for sunlight studies?\n\nAnd if there is can we run sunlight studies on 3d grids with Ladybug/Honeybee?\n\n<br/>Thanks in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 24, 2015 at 8:10pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1263149", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1294043"}
