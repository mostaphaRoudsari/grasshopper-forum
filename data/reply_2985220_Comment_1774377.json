{"body": "\nHi Daviduburke,\n\n\n\nI guess doors are often not modeled in order to stay with a reasonable amount of details concerning the energy model. \"Modeling\" is basically simplifying reality to make calculations possible, and my guess would be that you want to simplify as much as possible. However, I feel like it would be great to know the uncertainties associated with every simplification in an energy model, including this one.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of different ways to take their effect into account.\n\nTo account for leakages, you can for instance add inter-zone mixing flow rates in E+ that would account for mixing air between adjacent zones and zones to outdoor.\n\nIf you need a greater level of detail, you should integrate an aeraulic model and a thermal model using CONTAM or COMIS for instance. (I know there are some ways to make them work with E+, but never used them this way)\n\n\n\nAurelien\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aurelien Keller", "created_at": "June 26, 2017 at 2:01am", "created_by": "AurelienKeller", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1773433", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1774377"}
