{"body": "\nLam,\n\nYour case is no different from the other similar cases with adjacent surfaces. You need to remove the zones from the stair case and split the adjacent surfaces. Something like this image:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/QviZPQdtvn77gm6y2ebIKc5aGq6gSeV0McJRHKOzwh07sE3U4m4JZDMERiXu0dD0HSz29E5f1MXUKUHoFxjln43W0A6prbJN/stairs.png\" width=\"670\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/QviZPQdtvn77gm6y2ebIKc5aGq6gSeV0McJRHKOzwh07sE3U4m4JZDMERiXu0dD0HSz29E5f1MXUKUHoFxjln43W0A6prbJN/stairs.png)\n\nI suggest to simplify the staircase to a extruded polygon instead of a cylinder. That will save you a lot of time for the simulation and won't affect the results as much. Also if the stairs are highly glazed check the discussions for modeling highly glazed multi-story spaces with EnergyPlus. There are limitations in the process.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 15, 2017 at 12:20PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1813492", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1813703"}
