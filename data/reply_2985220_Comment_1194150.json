{"body": "\nHi Orn,\n\n\n\nTo run the radiation analysis you need to generate the sky and to generate the sky you need to have a climate file. Lon and lat will give you the sun position but they won't give you the intensity at the time so technically there is not way to generate an accurate sky based on only location information.\n\n\n\nYou can use sunlight hours component instead if you are trying to run some comparative studies.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 23, 2014 at 10:31pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1191714", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1194150"}
