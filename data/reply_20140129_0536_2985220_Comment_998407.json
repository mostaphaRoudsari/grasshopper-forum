{"body": "\nHi Chris and Mostapha,\n\nPlaying with both components i've found something inconsistent with the definition of Envelope and Fan.\n\nI'll say first that this will be a wish ...\n\nAssume a rectangle shape with the long side facing south and north. Define the period from 10 am to 14 pm (doesn't matter). Now when you get:\n\nEnvelope: You see the volume extending out of the boundaries of the rectangle. I suggest this to be sectioned/trimmed out to get the real envelope for the site.\n\nFan: About the same as the envelope but on the north side. The volume is entering into the \"own\" boundaries. In this case the Fan should be completed in order to get fully into the north border.\n\n\n\nDoes it make any sense for you? I understand that there could be some difficulties to accomplish this, but the result will be more correct .\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 29, 2014 at 05:36AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_998213", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_998407"}
