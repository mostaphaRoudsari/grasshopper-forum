{"body": "\nRpict,\n\nYou definitely want to have a small grid size in order to evaluate the radiation at a few different points (not just one) and average them together. \u00a0The HB run daylight simulation component is pretty much always going to be more accurate than the LB Cumulative Sky MTX because HB computes bounces of light (like that happening off of the ground or your shade). \u00a0The LB cumulative sky MTX component does not compute any light bounces (only direct radiation from the sky) and it is therefore only accurate in very open outdoor cases. \u00a0In you case, it looks like it should not make that big of a difference but the light bounces off of the ground and your shade should change the result.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 02, 2015 at 12:31PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1270871", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1278867"}
