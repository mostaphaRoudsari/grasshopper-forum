{"body": "\nHey Antonello,\n\nNow I understand, thanks.\n\nYeah, sun vectors would be nice. First thing that comes in mind is these really annoying dawn/dusk sun rays that shine in your eyes if you are lucky to sit next to a window XD. Would like to be able to address this issue in a building design, less glare s always better. But I guess it is only applicable to rural areas in most cases.\n\nThanks for the work and the reply, I appreciate this.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 8:07am", "created_by": "Timur582", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462697", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462795"}
