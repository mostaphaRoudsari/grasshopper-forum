{"body": "\nHi Albert,\n\nI agree with Will. I usually manage it all in Grasshopper. Here is how I do it.\n\n1. Import 2D plans into Rhino, and put them in layers based on building program.\n\n2. Use Human plugin to import them into Grasshopper, extrude and cap them.\n\n3. Create HBZones and so on...\n\nIf your curves/lines are clean then solveAdj should work 100%. I know that it is not always the case - there is a tolerance input in solveAdj component that should help in many cases.\n\nIf you are still having cases that don't work, I will be happy to take a look.\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: I just found a bug in OpenStudio component for exporting custom constructions. Use the attached component which has this issue fixed.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1181472", "name": "OpenStudioExample.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 04, 2014 at 10:56PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1181151", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1181470"}
