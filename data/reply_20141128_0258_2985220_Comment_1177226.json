{"body": "\nHi Mustapha I am grateful and really impressed how fast your responses are.\u00a0\n\nQ1. Makes totally sense now. The updated user objects gives me reasonable answers now. Also nice to see the hints on units. Neat.\u00a0\n\nQ2. OK I see Occupancy, Activity, Lighting, Equipment, Infiltration are working fine. But Heating and Cooling does not at the moment. Could you provide me with a sample dualpoint csv file, or where the standard files are placed, I might just cook something up to make HB happy here.\n\nQ3. I really like to see examples of using HB+LB+OpenStudio especially when it comes to controlling heating and cooling capacities. If you (or Chien Si)\u00a0have some messy test/example files, just send them to me (kristoffer.negendahl[at]gmail[dot]com) and I can spend some time cleaning and comment them out and place the here for future reference. In general I really like to see more examples of manipulation of systems.\n\nQ4. OK.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kristoffer Negendahl", "created_at": "November 28, 2014 at 02:58AM", "created_by": "KristofferNegendahl", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1177000", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1177226"}
