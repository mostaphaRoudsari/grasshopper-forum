{"body": "\nHi Devang,\u00a0\n\nI was wondering if you may be able to help me find a solution for another extension I have made to this script? I am trying to use galapogas to solve the best solution for maximum floor area whilst remaining above the 180mins sunlight coverage at 50%. I have it currently solving for the greatest floor area but i am not sure how to add the other criteria of only finding solutions that are above the required sunlight hours (180mins) - do you have any ideas/ tips??\n\nPlease see my attached files to get a better idea of what I mean :)\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KIUhBV3mdZ*37eK-d3lMdJm51aUk6Xxi1SAaNYC11fqJB0NQaAdmyS57TpK-OSjlIYCKp1ghxfbxTHM8NH*Vnpsd9rHyxjod/galapogassnap.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KIUhBV3mdZ*37eK-d3lMdJm51aUk6Xxi1SAaNYC11fqJB0NQaAdmyS57TpK-OSjlIYCKp1ghxfbxTHM8NH*Vnpsd9rHyxjod/galapogassnap.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1687135", "name": "170207_sunlight analysis_script_parametric building heights_percentages_of hours_GFA_galapogas.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1687136", "name": "170207_sunlight analysis.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "ClaudiavV", "created_at": "February 7, 2017 at 3:08pm", "created_by": "ClaudiavV", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1685817", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1687134"}
