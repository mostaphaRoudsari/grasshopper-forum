{"body": "Michael,\nThis seems like a reasonable request. If I am not mistaken, I think that Honeybee currently checks the PATH settings and, if it doesn't find radiance there or if it accidentally finds Radiance installed from DIVA (which has a different structure), it checks off the C drive. At the least, I imagine that we can check the location in ProgramFiles if it does not find an installation off of the C drive. Let's hear what Mostapha has to say and, if this method is good by him, I can implement it.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 24, 2015 at 04:26PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1367658", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1368144"}
