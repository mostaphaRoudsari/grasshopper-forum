{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and all,\n\n\n\nI am now setting up daylight and energy simulations for a large sports hall. The image below shows the section of the hall. It is not entirely exposed to outside. Some surfaces (maked in RED, GREEB and BLUE) are shared by two zones. The small zones (in GRAY) attached to the big hall are not taken into consideration in the research.\n\nIn this case, inclined surfaces are included, as the simplification of the grandstand for spectators.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AI-C-DD*hSc6VntPEZSUDxaa*DZJXpCziE-HOlozNa6ydITL68dLQNoqzrtQ7RQMRTnd4BYqlP-Nlzgz1bniSO4zRK8Hg4gq/QQ20151013152332.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AI-C-DD*hSc6VntPEZSUDxaa*DZJXpCziE-HOlozNa6ydITL68dLQNoqzrtQ7RQMRTnd4BYqlP-Nlzgz1bniSO4zRK8Hg4gq/QQ20151013152332.jpg)\n\n\n\nAs the image shows, \u00a0I have some questions:\n\n**1 - What should be the correct \u201csurface type\u201d of the inclined surfaces? floor?wall? or else?\u00a0**\n\n(Actually, I have tried both floors and walls, but warnings shown below were received. The weird thing is that they had been assigned as\u00a0floors and walls respectively having checked by the \"decomposeByType\"\u00a0component.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AI-C-DD*hSfp-PQsMRMz15LN8*j8cCZ1kfR2bQxs9v2HBXYIcc4ReFmb8nZnJLEAzrkz-32n*JovFfN-bHs47tTWWMG20bMI/3.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AI-C-DD*hSfp-PQsMRMz15LN8*j8cCZ1kfR2bQxs9v2HBXYIcc4ReFmb8nZnJLEAzrkz-32n*JovFfN-bHs47tTWWMG20bMI/3.jpg)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AI-C-DD*hSfhGgngF5pdky2nbo2M2Y-keVq*DgLg3bR5vIdOivyXAj4jIDUAfD9EbgL2blJhyVdC1G-HKtZeyHV3SfbvVgQl/4.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AI-C-DD*hSfhGgngF5pdky2nbo2M2Y-keVq*DgLg3bR5vIdOivyXAj4jIDUAfD9EbgL2blJhyVdC1G-HKtZeyHV3SfbvVgQl/4.jpg)\n\n**2 - Can I ignore these warnings? if not, why and how can I deal with it - how to assign inclined surfaces as proper \"type\"?**\n\n\n\n**3 - How can I get \"interiorWalls\"?**\n\nAlthough the small zones attached to the large hall are not considered in the research, I still need to assigned the shared walls as\u00a0interior Walls (and set EPBC as \"Adiabatic\"), right? But, having checked by\u00a0the \"decomposeByType\"\u00a0component regrading walls, all I got were \"walls\" instead of \"interiorWalls\". Then, how can I get \"interiorWalls\" as I want?\n\nBtw, due to the complexity of the geometry (e.g. containing inclined surfaces), I formed the thermal zone of the sports hall surface by surface using the \"createHBSrfs\" component as shown in above images. **Do you think if it is a proper way in my case?**\n\n\n\nAny help will be much appreciated!\n\nDing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "October 13, 2015 at 09:13AM", "created_by": "doudou", "topic": "How to assign inclined surfaces? + How can I get \"interiorWalls\"?", "id": "topic_1378245"}
