{"body": "\nTheodoros,\n\nI don't encourage to have a lot of windows in E+/ For me the rule is that if you can simplify the windows amount, do that. Meaning of that is that is that in effect you have small windows you want to unify them into one PROVIDING that they are under the same exposure conditions. Having lots of them will extend calculation time and probably the quality of results would not be much affected.\n\nSasying that i suggest to check\u00a0[this example](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Indoor_Microclimate_Map&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=7.472547163781119&amp;offset=-2394.85570224981,-1498.7474686606456) in hydra to see how to include \"real\" geometry as thermal mass (using this HB_addInternalMass component).\n\nHope this helps you having this a bit more clear.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 10:23pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519002", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519323"}
