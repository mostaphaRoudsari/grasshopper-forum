We will be at the [AEC Tech Symposium and Hackathon](http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-technology-symposium-2014/) this weekend and we will have a major release at the day of the hackathon! We will release the full suite of components for energy simulation for Honeybee and will introduce our new friend GrizzlyBear. [Of course! When there is a honeybee there should be a GrizzlyBear]\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirst of all, we want to welcome to [Chien Si Harriman](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/ChienSiHarriman) as the newest member of the development team. Chien Si is the developer of GrizzlyBear which exports Honeybee zones to [gbXML](http://www.gbxml.org/aboutgbxml.php).\n\n\u00a0\n\nHoneybee currently has more than 35 components to create multi-zonal energy models, customize constructions, loads and schedules and run the analysis using EnergyPlus 8.1 ([http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_about.cfm](http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_about.cfm)) and/or OpenStudio ([https://openstudio.nrel.gov/](https://openstudio.nrel.gov/)). Finally in case you want to work in other simulation environments GrizzlyBear will let you use the same objects and export them as a gbXML file!\n\n\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BE12GpjR2B8I4fT7WUGpfn4kfprAGflrPr1c4qCAWXP4GOC5g91c9bHdqiSL9q2YqSiTjLeFgYWsPygkEc3OPMRFKKgRFLn0M80Ic-k6uRGX9ca6TIzJSDvW1M9Bm2UW8w?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BE12GpjR2B8I4fT7WUGpfn4kfprAGflrPr1c4qCAWXP4GOC5g91c9bHdqiSL9q2YqSiTjLeFgYWsPygkEc3OPMRFKKgRFLn0M80Ic-k6uRGX9ca6TIzJSDvW1M9Bm2UW8w)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe workflow is pretty similar to Honeybee for Daylighting and uses the same HBZones.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/U1_Cyp_0uElamOXS1uRZT9J3YzrU1PThD3_WLrVp9K3EN5fmNrUEB6MOceKgeurlg0Zc1hCkCjoMw67rNI9WxKbuaALlCxpEPQjVSfSWsgapFxY0rUBXMpBuhpEqkugrjA?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/U1_Cyp_0uElamOXS1uRZT9J3YzrU1PThD3_WLrVp9K3EN5fmNrUEB6MOceKgeurlg0Zc1hCkCjoMw67rNI9WxKbuaALlCxpEPQjVSfSWsgapFxY0rUBXMpBuhpEqkugrjA)\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe are so excited for this initial release and will have a public release shortly after the hackathon. Looking forward to see some of you at the Hackathon and help you hack on top of Ladybug, Honeybee, and GrizzlyBear.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMore exciting news to come soon!\n\n\u00a0\n\nStay tuned,\n\nMostapha\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 13, 2014 at 6:45pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "topic": "Hackathon, GrizzlyBear and Honeybee for Energy Simulation", "id": "topic_1069505"}
