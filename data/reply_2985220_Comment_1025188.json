{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThanks for that video. Still having some problems, though. I originally installed Radiance on C:\\Energy\\Radiance (no spaces) and got the following issues when opening the \"000_GettingStarted_With_Honeybee.gh\"\u00a0file:\n\n\n\nWarnings:\n\n1. Honeybee cannot find RADIANCE folder on your system.\n\nMake sure you have RADIANCE installed on your system.\n\nYou won't be able to run daylighting studies without RADIANCE.\n\nA good place to install RADIANCE is c:\\radiance\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. Honeybee cannot find EnergyPlusV7-2-0 folder on your system.\n\nMake sure you have EnergyPlusV7-2-0 installed on your system.\n\nYou won't be able to run energy simulations without EnergyPlus.\n\nA good place to install EnergyPlus is c:\\EnergyPlusV7-2-0\n\n\u00a0\n\nError:\n\n1. Solution exception:Could not find a part of the path 'c:\\ladybug\\HoneybeeRadMaterials.mat'.\n\n---------------------\n\nI now reinstalled Radiance in the C:\\Radiance folder and when dropping the Honeybee_Honeybee component on the canvas, I get the following:\n\nRuntime error (DirectoryNotFoundException): Could not find a part of the path 'c:\\ladybug\\HoneybeeRadMaterials.mat'.<br/>Traceback:<br/> line 253, in __init__, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/> line 2200, in script\n\n----------------------\n\n[that is also the only \u00a0error that I'm now getting when opening the 000 getting started file).\n\nThere is no c:\\ladybug on my PC.\n\nNote: In order to run the Radiance installer, I had to run as administrator. My user doesn't have write rights on the c-root folder (and no chance of getting that either... :)\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nwim\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Wim R.M.
