{"body": "\nHi Francesco,\n\nI think your logic is right but at the same time writing the radiance file is a task which is done at some point. Isn't it? Can you tell me more about your case? In Grasshopper logic the components under shouldn't trigger if the component upstream hasn't finished the execution.\n\nAlso can connecting the same boolean toggle to both writeRad and runRad potentially solve the problem?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 16, 2015 at 04:15PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1264732", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1265178"}
