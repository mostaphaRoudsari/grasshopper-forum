{"body": "\nThank you Mostapha\n\nIn this method, can I still simulate the whole building performance to explore the amount of energy demand reduction due to the shading devices preventing the Sun's harsh rays penetrating into interior spaces?\n\nI think from your suggestion, we could only obtain the amount of electricity\u00a0produced from the PV, but we neglect the impact of shading elements on reducing the energy consumption of the building due to cooling loads, am I right?\u00a0\n\nThank you for your help\n\nHardi\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hardi Barznji", "created_at": "on Saturday", "created_by": "HardiBarznji", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810861", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1811085"}
