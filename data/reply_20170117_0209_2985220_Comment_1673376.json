{"body": "\nHello all,\n\nfrom this discussion I am learning new things but I need clarifications.\n\nI realize now (thanks to Devang) that in\u00a0the component\u00a0Ladybug_Sunlight Hours Analysis\u00a0the output totalSunlightHours is \"The average number of hours of direct sunlight received by the test _geometry.\" as the tooltip says. Actually I remember that this was just the sum of all the sunlight hours of each node, wasn't it? If it was not thenI am really getting old and my memory with me:)\n\n\n\nBut ok then, if it is the average then:\n\n1 - why it is still called \"total\" and not \"average\"?\n\n\n\n2 - can you please explain me these results?\n\nI have these two same geometries to test (the dark grey boxes) and the surrounding context.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Fxq0VavCSuDATxP3kvezeMRxR5y6ehk0NmcHJwn6dB-XcEzGk4KLPN6WL5hT8DrEkll2P1A4N6CIrXFJZWerKtB4r8FOpSNE/1.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Fxq0VavCSuDATxP3kvezeMRxR5y6ehk0NmcHJwn6dB-XcEzGk4KLPN6WL5hT8DrEkll2P1A4N6CIrXFJZWerKtB4r8FOpSNE/1.jpg)\n\n\n\nThese are the results\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Fxq0VavCSuBZY79Gv9CouQ62xflqacyLeOjQt92fISx-H8bxWsOdnwPp0htMr9EJcwWDkCrSdlf0V*GIkYuwQ86cQJQTOxHu/2.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Fxq0VavCSuBZY79Gv9CouQ62xflqacyLeOjQt92fISx-H8bxWsOdnwPp0htMr9EJcwWDkCrSdlf0V*GIkYuwQ86cQJQTOxHu/2.JPG)\n\n\n\nShould not then the result 2 and 3 be the same?\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "January 17, 2017 at 02:09AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "topic_1669294", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1673376"}
