{"body": "\nHi Chien Si,\n\n\n\nThanks for the info, I did not know that e+ and OS can handle that. I will certainly try it in the future.\n\n\n\nAs for the common file format, all EPDs are standarized within product categories. This means that there is a product category for Construction Products, and all the EPDs published under it will have exactly the same values and indicators reported.\n\n\n\nPerhaps that can be the format of the file (I hope that I got what you meant and it's not about coding).\n\n\n\nWhat would be invaluable then is a tool to extract the information in the EPD pdfs into this file (format). I have been thinking for something like that myself. In this way, a database could be very quickly populated.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 17, 2015 at 2:44am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1225797", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1226019"}
