{"body": "\nHello!\n\nI wonder how to plug in several pipe components as input for 'geometry' and 'context' of\u00a0 the Sunlight-Hours-Analysis-Component (without baking the geometry to rhino as I want to alter it with octopus) and hope somebody can help.\n\nAs I'm quite new to grasshopper. I guess it's something basic I missed here. I tried to collect all the pipes in a sinbgle brep or a surface component to further transfer the information to the sunlight hours component. But\u00a0 as it seems, I don't know how to do that.\n\nA screenshot and the grasshopper definition is attached.\n\nThank you very much!!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1553398", "name": "screenshot_question.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1553399", "name": "GD_pipes_to_analysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Bamboo Jumper", "created_at": "June 22, 2016 at 07:56AM", "created_by": "BambooJumper", "topic": "How to set multiple pipe components as input for Sunlight-Hours-Analysis-Component", "id": "topic_1553400"}
