{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI am a new follower (hi everybody) and I am trying to develop some nice tools for supporting preliminary sustainable analyses based on GH and Ladybug.\n\n\n\nI have some troubles with the solar radiation analyses: grid size input parameter does not consider the grid as I'd like.\n\nI'll try to explain better: if I draw a mesh I can divide it in many part as I want depending on 'u' and 'v' directions, while for the 'grid size' command I can only set an average value.\n\n\n\nThis point is not usually relevant, but if I have to consider the shading effect on the facade (for example vertical fins), I need to set the grid with the same size of the shadings step in order to perform the analysis correctly (i.e. avoiding the analysis points of the grid correspond to the shadings).\n\n\n\nPlease consider the picture attached: although I have set the 'grid size' with the same shading step, the grid points aren't comparable with the shading steps.\n\nHow can I do?\n\n\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1160826", "name": "Immagine.png"}], "created_by_name": "Riccardo Diaferia", "created_at": "November 3, 2014 at 8:53am", "created_by": "RiccardoDiaferia49", "topic": "Radiation analyses grid", "id": "topic_1160827"}
