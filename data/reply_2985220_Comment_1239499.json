{"body": "\nHi Reinier,\n\nI assume the implementation should be pretty easy but I need to double check and make sure it is really implemented to the released version of Daysim. Have you tested it?\u00a0\n\nIn theory all you need to do is to add -dss and -dss -s when you are calling gen_dc and dc_illum.\n\n\n\ngen_dc filename.hea **-dds**\n\nds_illum filename.hea **-dds [-s]**\n\n\n\n([http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Presentations/Radianc...](http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Presentations/Radiance%20WS2009_DaysimInnovations_CReinhart.pdf))\n\n\n\nI'm personally looking forward to applying 3-phase method to Honeybee soon but this should be easy enough to implement. If you can do the initial test runs and make sure the results make sense I can go ahead and add it to Honeybee.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 9, 2015 at 3:16pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1239564", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1239499"}
