{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI think the problema was on my side I mean my machine and HB where having strange behavior.\u00a0 Now the component works just fine. One question. What the colors of the glare component represents in terms of DGP scale. Can I find a scale some where so I can relate the colors to a comprehensive chart.\n\nAlso I'm uploading the works of Wienold, Jan; Christoffersen, Jens (\n\nEvaluation methods and development of a new glare prediction model for daylight\n\nenvironments with the use of CCD cameras) that came to this DGP concept. Very interesting\n\nThank you\n\nclaudio\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1150232", "name": "Evaluation_methods_and_development_of_a_new.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "October 16, 2014 at 1:37pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1149898", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1150231"}
