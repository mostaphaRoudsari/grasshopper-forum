{"body": "\nHi Eric,<br/><br/>I already turned off the Sunpath shading component's outputs. You didn't have to turn it by yourself. Sorry if my explanation wasn't good enough.<br/><br/>For baking: by default, when Ladybug components geometry is baked, the last parent layer is turned off. So what you have to do is to turn it on.<br/>Sometimes you even have to turn off the very last child layer. I think this may be a bug with Rhino.<br/>Also make sure that you choose **Shaded** or **Rendered** display mode instead of **Wireframe**. Here is a screenshots of the mentioned steps:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/NsUCuETiBEvbFaLDj79NgQ6HCdG2EXvqZ4ex*meyaQEJMugOoaI0jk3FnKAv7KesKlKCy0GCgVwJNAXorB2V6S-mRSqxFtr7/baking_Sunpath_Shading_geometry.jpg?width=200\" width=\"200\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NsUCuETiBEvbFaLDj79NgQ6HCdG2EXvqZ4ex*meyaQEJMugOoaI0jk3FnKAv7KesKlKCy0GCgVwJNAXorB2V6S-mRSqxFtr7/baking_Sunpath_Shading_geometry.jpg)\n\nFor the isocurves issue: the file I attached in my last reply creates them.
