{"body": "\nHi Caludio and Tatos,\n\n\n\nFor Daylight modeling you can use Radiance's image-mapping. I published a paper recently that discusses the process ([http://www.simaud.org/2015/program.php#a-new-approach-to-modeling-f...](http://www.simaud.org/2015/program.php#a-new-approach-to-modeling-frit-patterns-for-daylight-simulation)). They haven't send it online but I can email you the paper if you're interested to read it in details.\n\n\n\nFor EnergyPlus, I would say the best solution is to generate a BSDF material using the pillows and image mapping process that I mentioned above and apply that to the surface. I'm not an expert in either creating or using BSDF materials though. Andy\u00a0Mcneil has recently published a tutorial on BSDF which might be useful for this case.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 6:35pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412505", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412560"}
