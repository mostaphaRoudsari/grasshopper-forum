{"body": "\nHi M. et al... Following the question about evaluating pts for direct radiation at a specific time and location, I have made a file with the simplest definition: Two buildings, one in front of the other,\u00a0 setting the first building as context and getting the pts to evaluate from the other's front facade (i.e. the one facing the sun but obstructed by the other bldg)... the evaluation should give a list of boolean values (120 as the number of pts) it should be pretty simple, but I don't see how to get the result from the SunLightHours component... Thanks, R.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A965483", "name": "evalute_pts.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Rodrigo Velasco", "created_at": "November 28, 2013 at 6:42am", "created_by": "RodrigoVelasco", "topic": "Evaluate points for direct radiation", "id": "topic_965484"}
