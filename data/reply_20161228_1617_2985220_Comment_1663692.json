{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThank you for your answer.\n\nI tried to modify the activitySchedule in order to see if some changes could occur but\u00a0the result is the same.\n\nI don't understand the problem since I used the same procedure to costumize also the other schedules and they don't create any problems.\n\nAs further evidence I tried to link all the schedules to the E+ component and it works properly.\n\n\n\nDo you have any other ideas?\n\n\n\nThank you very much for your work.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carlie_3", "created_at": "December 28, 2016 at 04:17PM", "created_by": "Carlie_3", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1662294", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1663692"}
