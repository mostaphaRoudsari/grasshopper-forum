{"body": "\nHi\n\n\n\nI've just updated \u00a0to version 0.0.59 and my script is now broken. Most of the components I was able to update successfully. But the sunlight hour analysis component keeps failing and I can't work out why. The error says \"Too many variables to unpack\". What does this relate to and how can I fix it?\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1289129", "name": "Ladybug error.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Paul Wintour", "created_at": "May 18, 2015 at 12:01am", "created_by": "PaulWintour", "topic": "sunlight hour analysis component failing after update", "id": "topic_1289130"}
