{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you for your reply!\n\n\n\nI'm having the same problem as Simone. You solved this problem but another one occurred :)\n\nAs you know the Honeybee Generate Test Points has \"mesh\" as output and we can use it as an input in _inputMesh in the \"Ladybug_Recolor Mesh\" command for visualize the analisys together with the _analysisResult.\n\n\n\nI'm using a custom grid of points as a _testPoints input in a Grid Based Analisys and in this case I have to create the mesh named before.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThere is a way to generate a mesh that will work correctly (without holes) together with the analysis result?\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\nAlessandro\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1431843", "name": "MeshSurface.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alessandro Corso", "created_at": "January 06, 2016 at 01:03PM", "created_by": "AlessandroCorso", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1431359", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1431841"}
