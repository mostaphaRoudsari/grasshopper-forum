{"body": "\nOne related question:\n\n\n\nCan the runDaylightAnalysis component export multiple images to the same folder?\n\n\n\nIt appears to create a unique folder for each image that is produced, making 8760 folders if i iterate through 8760 hours by automating the MONTH, DAY, HOUR sliders.\n\n\n\nIf all images are dumped into one folder, i can check the number of image files in this folder and set the runs to trigger when the count changes, based on the link example in my recent post.\n\n\n\nSuggestions on an elegant way to iterate the three sliders MONTH, DAY, HOUR appropriately would also be appreciated . . .\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis is an extremely useful workflow already, but i want to do an annual run. \u00a0THANKS!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Octagon26", "created_at": "August 22, 2014 at 01:29PM", "created_by": "Octagon26", "parent_id": "topic_1119977", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1120086"}
