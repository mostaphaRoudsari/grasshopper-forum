{"body": "\nHi Saeran,\n\nFlexibility is important. As for your idea of 4 dates, it could be. Better than the actual situation. Even for the case of North/South hemisphere you need to allow this flexibility. In case you agree to consider maximum flexibility maybe you can implement a boolean flag, for Experts/Novice users. So the former can input freely and the later go with defaults (say, the 4 options you mentioned).\n\nIn case you don't think this is applicable for whatever reasons, the 4 dates is a must.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 05, 2014 at 10:34PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1003596", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1003953"}
