{"body": "\nHi Peter,\n\n\n\nThanks for replying!\u00a0\n\n'So for the sky then I guess it uses a climate based sky for every hour, if I am not wrong. How does this perform compared to the GenCumulativeSky? I want to achieve as accurate irradiation as f.x you can get from DIVA (but there you cannot get the hourly irradiation).\n\n\n\nCan you please look at the files, because I have done everything, I think, but when running the simulation it says that there is no light source, ending up with no results?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1262273", "name": "Untitled.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1262274", "name": "Hourly solar.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mihail Todorov", "created_at": "April 13, 2015 at 3:57pm", "created_by": "MihailTodorov", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262344", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262272"}
