{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\nfirst of all i would like to thank you all to be\u00a0always so helpful\u00a0and quick in your response. I always trust in you and in your help!! :)\n\nSo here i am again asking for something regarding the daylight simulation.\n\nIs there a way to match the DF_values with the testPts in order to plot the results\u00a0on the testGeometry grid in\u00a0Rhino (thus one value for each testPoint)?\n\nI mean, i am able to plot\u00a0the results in a \"visible way\", through the Gradient and Custom Preview components, but i would like also to read in Rhino the values of the Daylight Factor\u00a0on each testPoint. Is it possible?\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 10, 2016 at 7:39am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Daylight Simulations - How to plot results", "id": "topic_1545520"}
