{"body": "\nHey Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for your message and thanks for fixing up the bug. I was aware of the CBE paper and their method is great.\n\nI was wondering if you have ever encountered any discrepancies with other models. It seems that the CBE is tailored for indoor conditions, whereas other models are focused on outdoor (for example Rayman Model).\u00a0\n\n\n\n[http://www.mif.uni-freiburg.de/rayman/](http://www.mif.uni-freiburg.de/rayman/)\n\n[http://www.mif.uni-freiburg.de/rayman/description.htm](http://www.mif.uni-freiburg.de/rayman/description.htm)\n\n\n\nI will dig more into that...\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nberardo\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Berardo Matalucci", "created_at": "October 29, 2014 at 7:25am", "created_by": "BerardoMatalucci", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1157306", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1157587"}
