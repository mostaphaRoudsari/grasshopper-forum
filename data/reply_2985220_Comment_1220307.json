{"body": "\nHi Daniel,\n\n\n\nIt fells little bit random when it works.\n\nIt should work all the time. If it doesn't please let us know about the cases so we can get it fixed.\n\n\n\n\u00a0have you ever experienced with that slider component it just keep looping, and never stops?\n\nDo you have a button connected to runItAll component or is it a Boolean Toggle? If you have a Boolean Toggle connected to the component it can cause the issue of having everything run forever.\n\n\n\nNow when having a lot of results, is there anyome there have some good tips/idea on how to manage and visualize things in a easy way?\n\nMy favorite topic of the day! The best that I know is visualizations like parallel coordinates. Check the pollination project for an example ([http://honeypatch.github.io/pollination/analysis](http://honeypatch.github.io/pollination/analysis)). I'm planning to develop one for Honeybee soon so you can plot results of parametric analysis and explore the options.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 7, 2015 at 8:21pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1219404", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1220307"}
