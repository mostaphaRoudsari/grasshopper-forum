{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for your answer. I understand from the long discussion that it has been a difficult issue. I was wondering though, since my laptop was working before I updated to the latest Openstudio, would there be a solution to this using earlier version dll files? And do you maybe know of a link for them? Tried looking but didn't manage (Mostapha's link is already updated).\n\n\n\nHere's to hoping this get's resolved!\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 28, 2015 at 1:11am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1295751", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1297189"}
