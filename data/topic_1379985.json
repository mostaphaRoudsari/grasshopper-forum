{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI have a couple of questions regarding 2 \"Severe errors\" retrieved from the component Run Energy Simulation. The problem is that apparently E+ finds some surfaces to be degenerate. Specifically, in the extensive error log from E+, I found that the vertices belonging to those surfaces are considered collinear and therefore the surfaces are turned into degenerate and most likely discarded as not useful. However, the analysis runs and I can get results.\n\nActually I am not sure if this problem is going to lead to unreliable results. Did anybody have this problem? Is it really going to affect the results?\n\nSecond question: since the errors log from E+ indicates the IDs of the degenerate surfaces, is it possible to know to which surfaces those IDs belong to? This would be needed in order to check if there is really something wrong in the geometry, even though it looks completely fine in both GH and Rhino.\n\n\n\nI attach the GH script. I hope someone can help with this.\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\nAntonio\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pip6g4jx0sfMWH24NTiHpMbyGEEC6w38P7k-Dx5wRVFVdteU17GVEp89-4WogxW2k3oKa1IoRU0R8vL0vKar3o8RhILrn1jx/scriptdeg.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pip6g4jx0sfMWH24NTiHpMbyGEEC6w38P7k-Dx5wRVFVdteU17GVEp89-4WogxW2k3oKa1IoRU0R8vL0vKar3o8RhILrn1jx/scriptdeg.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1379984", "name": "testDegenerateSurf.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antonio D'Aquilio", "created_at": "October 16, 2015 at 7:08am", "created_by": "AntonioDAquilio", "topic": "EnergyPlus/Honeybee Degenerate surfaces", "id": "topic_1379985"}
