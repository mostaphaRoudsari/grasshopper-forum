{"body": "\nHi Youngjae,\n\nWhenever you see this error it means that means that the snappyHexMesh is touching the boundingbox that is created by butterfly. There are usually two reasons for this to happen:\n\n1. The locationInMesh is outside the case, and the mesh is created in the wrong place. Use ParaView (if the mesh is large) or loadMesh to visualize the mesh.\n\n2. The case is not a close geometry and the mesh is created for the whole boundingbox. Again visualizing the mesh should show the issue.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 17, 2017 at 06:35AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1734133", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1734293"}
