{"body": "\nMona,\n\nI checked your GH file and the context geometry is almost completely enclosing zone geometry. \u00a0So you are either going to get an energy model with no solar gains (in which case you might as well make a model without windows) and/or you will get a severe warning that your context geometry is intersecting your zone geometry. \u00a0Generally, I am not sure what you are tying to simulate here.\n\nAlso, your context geometry consists of 1701 individual surfaces so, even if the context geometry made sense in relation to the zones, you can't expect the simulation to finish in under an hour. \u00a0You should question how much geometric detail you really need to simulate your case accurately. \u00a0A different version of this context geometry with fewer polygons is going to have virtually exact the same performance as what you have here.\n\n-Chirs\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 15, 2015 at 3:25pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1328050", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1326736"}
