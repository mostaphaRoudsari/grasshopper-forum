{"body": "\nGuys-\u00a0\n\ngreat work! will check out the new IES_project component - i'm running some first real-project tests right now. so far i also found that if i path to an ies file, the file name can't have spaces (duh). but being able to link in how you suggest would obviously solve this issue.\n\n\n\nyou are correct about the Type 2 ies - we've run into this problem a few times, and yes, we typically transform in photometric toolbox. it's just a pain. if it's on your to-do list, then awesome.\u00a0\n\nA few new comments:\n\n\n\nMore generally, i'm not totally sure how we'll use this yet - in the office we've been transitioning from AGI to using iray in 3ds max (for some people quicker than others), which obviously puts out much higher quality renderings than radiance. but i think for more analytical studies this will, for me at least, be a total game-changer, and totally replace AGI. I also think it'll be a great replacement for photometric toolbox for photometric analysis. But if you're looking for further capabilities to add, AGI is a good place to start.\n\n\n\ni'll keep a running log of issues/ideas as i find them and keep you posted.\u00a0\n\n\n\nthanks a ton\n\ndan\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Weissman", "created_at": "March 03, 2016 at 09:08AM", "created_by": "DanWeissman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1474434", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1476747"}
