{"body": "\nHi Fahimeh\n\n\n\nI am looking at your file and trying to work out what could be going wrong. To me that actually makes sense in most cases the smaller the windows the less energy used as the U-value of windows is (usually) much higher than surrounding walls.\n\n\n\nAs you will see the U-value of your window is 3.6 while the U-value of your wall is 0.38 smaller than a tenth of the U-value of the window. Given these materials I would think that even with no windows (and lighting required all the time) less energy would be used than having windows.\n\n\n\nWhat is the minimum WWR required for building codes in Tehran? Or what is the minimum natural day lighting that you think would be suitable? I would work your optimisation from there.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "August 31, 2015 at 4:29am", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1351134", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1351751"}
