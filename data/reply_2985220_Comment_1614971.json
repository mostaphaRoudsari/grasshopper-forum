{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nSo you gave me some homework and i did it :-)\n\nThere are differences, some of them big, specially with NaturalVentilation and Storage results:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AxtJ5-qvacYGuodV6TQUekAwzehszCtMV59Q49MJbup1bkWb1OI70NRWxABK94yP*JgflgaWCgiHIjb-NpbjlHX1OzflMRPD/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AxtJ5-qvacYGuodV6TQUekAwzehszCtMV59Q49MJbup1bkWb1OI70NRWxABK94yP*JgflgaWCgiHIjb-NpbjlHX1OzflMRPD/Capture.JPG)And the summary of the differences are (i left only those that are significant):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AxtJ5-qvacZsDUD24A5b9VQTHATm4fL5ImIL7DFSBIUFaEIcDkvcl*YBtvA2o9AUUQw5y2BCRiyriPd3uGGsoeyQfRe*8gsR/Difference.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AxtJ5-qvacZsDUD24A5b9VQTHATm4fL5ImIL7DFSBIUFaEIcDkvcl*YBtvA2o9AUUQw5y2BCRiyriPd3uGGsoeyQfRe*8gsR/Difference.JPG)\n\nAs you see, naturalVentilation is giving higher loses in the OS option.\n\nAttached also an excel with all the data. Maybe it will help.\n\nIs this useful for debuging?\n\n\n\nThe error of the simulation is related to non-convex surfaces. Is severe but the simulation runs. I need to check where is (are) the bad surface and correct it.\n\n-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1614972", "name": "Compare_EnergyBalance.xlsx"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 9, 2016 at 11:29pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1614894", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1614971"}
