{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nthanks for answering me. Meanwhile I've opened\u00a0[another discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/building-design-with-solar-envelope), in which an user advised me to try Octopus or Galapagos.. So I've done some researches on this group, finding\u00a0[this publication](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/knowledge-sharing-agent-based-geometry-optimization-for-tall)\u00a0that, at first glance, seems to be something good for me (what do you think? Before beginning to work on it I'd like to know if you think it might help me).<br/><br/>Thanks to your video tutorial I've understood the meaning of \"solar envelope\", so I never meant to consider an envelope as the final shape of a building..<br/>But..\n\nThe central point of my question is: the component SolarEnvelope is written in order to guarantee the best sun exposure at the ground level. To do this it's forced to reduce the envelope's surface, specially on the sides exposed to South.. and this could limit the energy performances of a building. How can I find a good compromise?\u00a0<br/><br/>We could see the problem from another point of view, if you prefer: how to pass from a first level, in which we define a solar envelope, to a second level, in which we start to design the building without interrupting the workflow and keeping all parametric?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leonardo Roli", "created_at": "March 1, 2015 at 2:44am", "created_by": "LeonardoRoli", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1233681", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1234014"}
