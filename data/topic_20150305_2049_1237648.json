{"body": "\nDear Mosthapha and Honeybee developers, greetings. I have an issue when trying to create custom EP materials and constructions: 1.- The \u201cuserCustomEPLibrary.idf\u201d file in my working folder (the one that I\u2019ve putted on the HBHB input) seems to have no changes (it says \u201c!Honeybee custom EnergyPlus library\u201d only when I open it with a text editor) when using addToEPConsLibrary. Nevertheless, some times I can use \u201clocally\u201d the material\u2019s names for setting the constructions (weird). 2.- When I try to Call those materials and constructions on another GH expression (supposing that those were added) the callFromEPConsLibrary component don\u2019t deliver any data.\u00a0\n\nI've read that this issue was fixed but i don't know what i am doing wrong, so please help!\n\n\n\nBest Regards and thank you for this awesome development!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pablo Salvador Banda", "created_at": "March 05, 2015 at 08:49PM", "created_by": "PabloSalvadorBanda", "topic": "Create custom EP materials and constructions,", "id": "topic_1237648"}
