{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nAs some of you have probably received a similar email Performance Workshop is celebrating their anniversary* and they made their webinars available for free for this month.\n\nThere are four presentations about Ladybug and Honeybee by Chris, Anton and Djordje that you may want to watch or forward to a friend/colleague who is looking to learn something new over the holidays.\n\nAs expected Chris's videos [are as twice as long as any other workshop](https://vimeo.com/user1270768/videos/sort:duration/format:thumbnail)\u00a0and pretty easy to find :) but to make it even easier for you I put them all here in one post.\n\nThere are other interesting presentations about other available simulation tools and performance related topics. I encourage everyone to check them out.\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"313\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/121041217\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n\n[Ladybug Parametric Climate Analysis](https://vimeo.com/121041217)\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/126000563\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n\n[Honeybee Daylight Analysis](https://vimeo.com/126000563)\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/128646076\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n\n[Honeybee for Energy Analysis](https://vimeo.com/128646076)\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/143526320\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n\n[Honeybee Generation and Ladybug Photovoltaics](https://vimeo.com/143526320)\n\n\n\n* Arpan's announcement on LinkedIn ([https://www.linkedin.com/groups/2085105/2085105-6080054426171695104](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/2085105/2085105-6080054426171695104)).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 12, 2015 at 12:29pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "topic": "Watch Ladybug + Honeybee Webinars", "id": "topic_1420372"}
