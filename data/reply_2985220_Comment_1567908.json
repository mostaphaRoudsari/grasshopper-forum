{"body": "\nYou once told me in another discussion that the TOF component did less calculations than the PV Surface component and would therefore be faster. However, it seems to go even slower when you have multiple surfaces.\n\nMaybe I misunderstood [what your intention was](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/xn/detail/2985220:Comment:1562413?xg_source=activity).<br/>The TOF component is intended to be used to determine the TOF of a single **_PV_SWH_surface** or few of them. 1600 surfaces is definitively a huge number.<br/><br/>Here is a work around:<br/><br/>Use the TOF component with a single _PV_SWH_surface to calculate the optimal tilt and azimuth. Then use these optimal tilt and azimuth values as an input for Photovoltaics surface component. The annual insolation you get is the optimal annual insolation. Then use the annual value of that optimal insolation to divide the insolation of every other surface inputted to the Photovoltaics surface component. The result multiplied with 100 will be the TOF for each of those surfaces.<br/>I attached an example below.<br/><br/>Btw have in mind that 1600 surfaces is definitively too much. You will probably need to lower this number and expect a couple of hours of calculation.<br/><br/>Sorry for not being able to edit the very file you attached. It simply loads too much on PC, I can not open it (I probably can, but would have to let it go for tens of minutes, and I do not have that much time).\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1567909", "name": "TOF_parabolic_hyperboloid2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 18, 2016 at 2:28pm", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1567922", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1567908"}
