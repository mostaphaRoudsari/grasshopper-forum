(seems the HB_generate_EP_output component have a few, although sufficient, options)\n\n\n\n2. how to specify **Output:Meter** variables, such as Electricity:Building, InteriorLights:Electricity, InteriorEquipment:Electricity, that are used to calculate Plug Loads?\n\n\n\n3. What if I want to get the following output variables?\n\n- **Zone Total Internal Total Heating Energy/Rate** (which is total internal gains)\n\n- **Zone Windows Total Heat Gain Energy/Rate** and **Zone Windows Total Heat Loss Energy/Rate** for calculation of net window gains\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "July 22, 2015 at 1:15am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "[clarified] about EnergyPlus output variables in HB", "id": "topic_1330104"}
