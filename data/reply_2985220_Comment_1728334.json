{"body": "\nThank you, Mostapha.\n\n\n\nDo you mean that, for a particular HOY, e.g. \"10\" or **1-Jan 10am**, the skyDome component actually shows the radiation of the Tregenza sky (145 patches) when the sun is positioned at **9:30am**?\n\n\n\nIf that is the case, does gendaymtx takes the **average value between 9am and 10am** for the direct normal, diffuse horizontal and global horizontal radiations from the weather file for its calculation?\n\n\n\nMay I ask the source of reference mentioning gendaymtx's consideration of \"radiation values for the hour between time steps\" since it does not seem to be mentioned in the manual of [gendaymtx](https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/gendaymtx.pdf)?\n\n\n\nIt seems that the **skyVisualizer** produces a more reasonable **Perez sky** image for the hour with no direct radiation (e.g. 7:30am, 1-Jan) as compared to that by the skyDome component:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/mDIukdquEanRNXr8I7fNPolsCMYXNYVoOGx19zivTIfy*80Ov5N6un05RU7Rk6jZ0VLSgSpdqeFF-CiupTWBIQkAWd7QmTpG/Image40.png\" width=\"659\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/mDIukdquEanRNXr8I7fNPolsCMYXNYVoOGx19zivTIfy*80Ov5N6un05RU7Rk6jZ0VLSgSpdqeFF-CiupTWBIQkAWd7QmTpG/Image40.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1728336", "name": "tregenza sky patch viz _v2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "April 5, 2017 at 10:10pm", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1728040", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1728334"}
