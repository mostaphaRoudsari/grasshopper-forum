{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nI like the diagram and the information about temperature buffers is good. \u00a0However, if your cooling setpoint is at 25C, you will never want to open the windows if the outdoor temperature is above 25C (otherwise the outdoor air will be heating up your space instead of cooling it down). \u00a0So your upper outdoor temperature limit should be the same as your cooling setpoint. \u00a0I would also recommend using a cooling setpoint around 28C since natural ventilation enables you to use the adaptive comfort model that makes these warmer indoor temperatures much more desirable.\n\nFinally, I would set the lower limit of outdoor air temperature to be 12C instead of 19C. \u00a0Our air conditioning systems deliver cold air that is at 12C and so people will usually be fine with having the windows open up until this point. \u00a0You usually, you want the indoor temperature to dirve when it's too cold for natural ventilation and not the outdoor temperature.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 18, 2016 at 5:49pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1601487", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1601500"}
