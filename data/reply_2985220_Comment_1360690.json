{"body": "\nKhaoula,\n\nI would not say that this is a problem with the analysis period component but it is definitely an indication that the sunpath has a different interpretation of the analysis period than the other Ladybug components. \u00a0In one sense, I can see that it might be confusing \u00a0if an analysis period from 10 to 14 gave you 5 hours of data instead of 4 (since you might expect 14-10=4). \u00a0However, all of the other ladybug components would give you the 5 hours of data for this type of analysis period and I feel that, for the sake of consistency with the other Ladybug components, you are right that you should get 5 sun vectors out for this type of analysis period. \u00a0If Mostapha agrees, I will change this in the sunpath component.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 13, 2015 at 3:56pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1359261", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1360690"}
