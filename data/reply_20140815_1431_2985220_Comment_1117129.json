{"body": "\nThanks for your replies so far.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMostapha, I have played with Galapagos and that does work the way I want it. However, while that finds an optimum, I want to create a series of options for the architect to evaluate, with different pros &amp; cons. I'm making a parellel coordinate chart like so:\u00a0[http://bl.ocks.org/jasondavies/1341281](http://bl.ocks.org/jasondavies/1341281) so I need to fill it with a few hundred / thousand simulation.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have grafted the output from the component (per your tip, Chris) and that actually work; if I configure the data tree correctly, I can let Honeybee run 3 simulations for each option. However, if I feed the DaylightAnalysis component with 3 filenames it doesn't separate them the way I want to. Will fiddle with it some more.\n\n\n\nChris, the slider also works, but I want to vary multiple sliders for my database.\u00a0\n\n\n\nStill, appreciate the discussion - at least I'm not missing a glaringly obvious solution.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reinier Zeldenrust", "created_at": "August 15, 2014 at 02:31PM", "created_by": "ReinierZeldenrust", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1116534", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1117129"}
