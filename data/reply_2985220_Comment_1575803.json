{"body": "\nChristian and Antonello,\n\n\n\nVery interesting discussion here.\u00a0 Antonello has pointed to the right reference ([the EnergyPlus Input/Output reference](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/input-output-reference/)) for modeling unique building features like the ones you list here. The question of whether you can model these features in the way that you envision depends largely on whether you can find suitable EnergyPlus objects in that web page.\u00a0 The swimming pool seems like it will be sufficient to model the water features but the vegetation may be a bit more complex and you might need to find a substitute.\n\n\n\nSince there are no Grasshopper components in Honeybee to model these things, you will have to add them to the HB EnergyPlus model using the additionalStrings_ input on the Openstudio or EnergyPlus components.\u00a0 Here is an example of how to add additional IDF text to a model in grasshopper:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Evaporative_Cooling_Tower&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\nThis example is specifically for modeling an evaporative cooling tower, which could be a workaround for vegetation if you get the evaporation of the tower to match your anticipated evaporation from plants in the space (you might have to heavily schedule the cooling tower's use to do so).\u00a0 Here is another example of using custom IDF text to model a green roof:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Green_Roof_In_Energy_Model&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\nThe only reason why I think this green roof might to be suitable to model your vegetation is that the E+ reference stresses that this vegetation is only intended for exterior surfaces like green roofs and not interior vegetation.\u00a0 It is also seemingly only intended to model low-lying vegetation and not vegetation from trees, which it seems you might have in your model.\n\n\n\nI'm very interested in hearing the answers to the unmet hours discussion as my my suggested workarounds for indoor vegetation are very hacky.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 3, 2016 at 8:04am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1575790", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1575803"}
