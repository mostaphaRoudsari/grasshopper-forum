{"body": "\nHi Nita,\n\nFor comparing your \"original\" idf with the one created with HB i suggest using the idf editor from E+. There you can see if the different classes were imported by HB (i know that shades are not, but i'm not sure about others). ANother option is to compare both files with something like WinMerge (free tool).\n\nIf your idf is not running i suggest to open a discussion for that attaching the relevant files.\n\nAs for Octopus, as i said, i'm not an \"expert\". But you need to connect to the G (genome) the sliders that change the alternative (window size, wall size, etc) and to O (objectives) the results that according to them the optimizationn will be calculated.\n\nThings i don't know: how to make a maximization of one of the results and minimization of another (max lighting, for instance, min energy, etc). When you get that please share.\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 18, 2015 at 11:00pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1266213", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1266913"}
