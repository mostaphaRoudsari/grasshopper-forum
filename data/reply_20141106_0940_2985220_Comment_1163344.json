{"body": "\nHi Reiner,\n\nI'm sorry for the difficulties that you are experiencing with this and thank you for being patient. \u00a0I have not been able to replicate the error on my system and I keep getting the results below:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/st-pA-4csCGuuyIq0BcdXTNt-RgNmJrC-Ojf8EqAxv4*OhpXLmLIVzPmVK3gQmrPFzjej8iejFrhFf70rXUZ62f-mHMDTOXD/SolarAdjustedMRTOK.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/st-pA-4csCGuuyIq0BcdXTNt-RgNmJrC-Ojf8EqAxv4*OhpXLmLIVzPmVK3gQmrPFzjej8iejFrhFf70rXUZ62f-mHMDTOXD/SolarAdjustedMRTOK.PNG)\n\nAlso, there seem to be at least two other users who have the new component working on their machines so it seems that the problem is specific to something on your system. \u00a0If you could post the full error that you are getting (with the lines of code), this will help me diagnose the problem. \u00a0It could be an issue with different versions of RhinoCommon that people have on their systems or maybe it's something related to the Radiance functions. Have you been able to run Ladybug radiation studies ok?\n\nI will post here once the mannequin is colored with radiant temperature so that you know when it's ready.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 06, 2014 at 09:40AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163179", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163344"}
