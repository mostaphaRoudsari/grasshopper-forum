{"body": "\nThank you Antonello.<br/><br/>I was not complaining that the \"_basePoint_\" needs to be on the terrain. I perfectly understand the concept of raising the points from the base (where the tiles are) upwards.<br/><br/>I just suggested that a point input name (regardless if it lies on a terrain surface/mesh or not) should probably not have a very similar name to the output which lies on the terrain surface/mesh.<br/><br/>So I am ok with \"Terrain Generator\" component keeping the \"_basePoint_\" input to lie on the same plane where the \"tiles\" are.<br/><br/><br/>Ok, I will change the name output of the \"Terrain Generator 2\" component from \"originPt\" to \"origin\" and I will edit the hover text of each of \"Terrain Analysis\" component's required inputs, that they can use both \"Terrain Generator\" and \"Terrain Generator 2\" data.<br/>Thank you once again for the permission, and sorry for being a bit too picky on this.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "October 04, 2016 at 05:20PM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1611048", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1610888"}
