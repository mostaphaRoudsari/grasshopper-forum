{"body": "\nHey guys,\n\n\n\nI am new to honeybee and have tried to model a house with 2 energy zones, one zone for roof area, and one zone for the area below the roof.\n\nI would like to calculate the zone energy use for those 2 zones.\n\n\n\nHowever, I simply can not get the simulation going correctly. Zones always goes wrong and end up in BREPS instead of 2 zones.\n\n\n\nI wonder if the way I have modeled the house went wrong. I followed the Chris Mackey tutorial, and maybe there is something I missed.\n\n\n\nWould be really really grateful if anyone can help me out, cause I am really almost desperate...\n\n\n\nMany many thanks in advance...:D\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "AngelXU", "created_at": "April 19, 2015 at 2:12pm in ", "created_by": "AngelXU", "topic": "Zone Energy Use Problem...Desperate...", "id": "topic_1267373"}
