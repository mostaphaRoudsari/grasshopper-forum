I've been referencing through the code of HB_HB based on some components but I can't seem to get how the Library works and how this new feature would fit in.\n\n\n\nI went ahead and added some code into the main HB_HB component\n\ne.g.\n\nunder the\u00a0EPObjectsAux.addEPObjectToLib method, i added\u00a0\"MaterialProperty:PhaseChange\" : \"honeybee_PhaseCHange\" to\u00a0**HBLibrarieNames** dictionary and some other things within the EPObjectsAux class, I bet that's not how it works though\n\n\n\n-----\n\nI'm also not sure if the remaining classes (\n\nMaterialProperty:VariableThermalConductivity<br/> HeatBalanceSettings:ConductionFiniteDifference<br/> HeatBalanceAlgorithm<br/> SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Inside,TARP;<br/> SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Outside,DOE-2;\n\n) should be written as a separate component... How do you usually do these things? It'd probably be impractical to have one component per class right? Ultimately, my goal is to enable parametric simulations for PCMs available in HB.\n\n\n\n----\n\nAlso, do I need to edit some things within Run EP Simulation?\n\nI noticed WriteIDF has methods such as\u00a0EPHeatBalanceAlgorithm and\u00a0EPHeatBalanceAlgorithm, although it seems they're turned off at the moment\n\n-----\n\nJust to clarify.. when the RunEP component writes the idf file.. the order the classes are written doesn't matter right? i.e.\u00a0SimulationControl can go first, it can also go last?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1663639", "name": "try-parametric-simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Pin", "created_at": "December 28, 2016 at 03:33AM", "created_by": "Pin", "topic": "Developing a component for PCMs in HB, I need help + other questions", "id": "topic_1663640"}
