{"body": "\nDropbox is very strange.\n\n\n\nEvery time I request a link it gives me a different address. The link from my HD is completely different from the ones in the web portal. And sometimes the links of a folder are different than the links of the files inside.\n\n\n\nI would also love a standard way of generating this, or perhaps something else than dropbox. Maybe googledrive?\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 28, 2016 at 2:43am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448870", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448803"}
