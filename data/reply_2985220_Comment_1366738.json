{"body": "\nHi Anton!\n\n\n\nThank you for the reply, apologies for my late one.\n\nYes my issue is with the Run EnergyPlus simulation component, it has a\u00a0\"Solution exception: index out of range: 0\" issue which only seems to happen if I split my zones individually to provide different schedules to them.\n\n\n\nMy building constructions are in the userCustomlibrary idf file, you need to replace this file with your own one in your ladybug folder where you store your OpenStudioMasterTemplate idf file. This idf was created by Mostapha to enable us to easily use constructions from our old idf files without having to try and construct them all manually in honeybee. Similarly with schedules.\n\n\n\nSure I can discuss it over skype, however I am in NZ so our time zones would make it tricky to organise a time and I am currently trying to get Rhino on my laptop at home from the university to allow me to skype and show my screen to my supervisor (who is currently in England).\n\n\n\nI will take some screenshots of where my problems are and perhaps annotate the gh file a bit more to make it easier to follow what I am doing.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "September 22, 2015 at 4:06pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1364522", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1366738"}
