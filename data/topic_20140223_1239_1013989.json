{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI have this case where i have a facade divided in multiple surfaces, according to the floor they are. This is a constrain.\n\nI'm doing a SVC grid analysis and i receive the grid results OK. The thing is that i want to show the results as a mesh. The LB_RecolorMesh says that \"the length of the results are not equal\" ... but they are. I tried to graft/simplify/etc but no use on this.\n\nWhen there is only one surface i get the mesh.\n\nI see in the grid example that you use the HB_DecomposeBasedOnType to send to the HB_GenerateTestPoints. I don't want to do this mainly becouse i don't need. I just want the result on a surface i select.\n\nSo your advice will be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1013988", "name": "HB__SVC_ForOlga_A1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 23, 2014 at 12:39PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "Multiple surfaces - Grid analysis - Mesh results", "id": "topic_1013989"}
