{"body": "\nIs it possible to create laminated glass with Sentryglas interlayers by using the EP Construction component? I've had a a lot of success creating IGU's so I'm hopeful I can make laminated glass without just plugging in values for the EP window material component. If it is possible, how would I create a material for the interlayer (as it is not an opaque material, glass material, or air gap)?\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\nAaron\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "May 14, 2015 at 01:19PM", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "topic": "Laminated Glass", "id": "topic_1286873"}
