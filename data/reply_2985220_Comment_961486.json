{"body": "\nStill funny :-)\n\nWell. This is not what i meant at all but the results is the same. When i said \"point\" i always intended them to be the ViewPoints, as in the component. Now, you check if you see from each of those point a Geometry (say, a surface). So according to the grid size you have more or less of those. The thing a was asking is if it is possible to average those values, so i can know that viewPoint1 sees 80% of the geometry. What you did above gives the value but \"backwards\". I think it should be simpler to average the values (less work for you, i suppose ..., right?).\n\nI think, but not sure, that you are doing something like this in the averageView output, but for all ViewPoints. I'm asking for this but for each VP.\n\n\n\nI'm getting messy in this one.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 21, 2013 at 9:11am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_961479", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_961486"}
