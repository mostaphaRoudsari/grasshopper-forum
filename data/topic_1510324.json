{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if this cool application could be included in HB.\u00a0\n\n<br/> I apologize if what it does can already be performed through the daysim components, I just now started using them in actual cases.\n\n\n\nIf this is not very easy or probable to happen soon, is there a way to export my .rad scene with HB? Again I sincerely apologize if that is what happens when I press true in daylight simulation.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 17, 2016 at 8:30am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "DAYSIMps", "id": "topic_1510324"}
