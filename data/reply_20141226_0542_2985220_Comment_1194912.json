{"body": "Abraham and Mostapha,\n\nI'm very sorry for responding so late. I revised the shade benefit evaluators a few months ago to not need the LB sunpath component anymore. This proved to be very necessary in order to ensure that temperature values were synced correctly with sun vectors without making things crazy for the user. Now, all that you have to do is take temperature values directly from the import epw component and plug them into the comfort shade benefit evaluator (CSBE). The CBSE now also has a required _location input from the import epw component and it uses this to compute sun vectors (inside the component) that match the hourly temperature values. Let me know if that answers your question well enough and sorry again for the lateness.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 26, 2014 at 05:42AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1190658", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1194912"}
