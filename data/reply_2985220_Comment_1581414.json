It run fine on my system.\n\nSo i would ask if are you sure you have write rights in the c:\\ladybug directory?\n\nHave you succeeded with other cases?\n\nIf no, please give, in the workingFolder input, a location in your computer where you are sure the previous rights are granted.\n\nAlso, can you check at the bottom part of the panel with the report what is written in there?
