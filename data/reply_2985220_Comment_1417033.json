{"body": "\nJavier,\n\nThis is wonderful! \u00a0Congratulations on producing such an awesome thesis. \u00a0The presentation of the final design is compelling and the Ladybug graphics are being deployed in some interesting and creative ways.\n\nThe only point of feedback that I would give is that I see you reference the PMV model on pages 34-36 and this model probably does not describe the conditions that your occupants will find comfortable well since the PMV model was derived by placing subjects in tightly-conditioned climate chambers. \u00a0There have been major discrepancies discovered between this model and observations of occupants in naturally ventilated buildings and so I would suggest using the Adaptive Comfort component to assess the comfort of your occupants instead.\n\nAgain, great work and congratulations!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 7, 2015 at 9:44pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1416869", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1417033"}
