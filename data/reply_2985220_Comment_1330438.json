{"body": "\nHi Daniel,\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if I totally understand what are you trying to do. Warmup period is different from the analysis period and is critical for the accuracy of the results. Are you trying to set the warming up period to 0 days to see the effect on the results? If that is the case you should use Honeybee Simulation Control component.\n\n\n\nSee this discussion for an example:\u00a0\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/warming-up-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/warming-up-period?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1278988&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 22, 2015 at 4:26am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1330290", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1330438"}
