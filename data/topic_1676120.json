{"body": "\nhi, i am working on the adaptive reuse of a certain high-rise building. What i have is a floor plan for it, which is fairly simple. I have set up the geometry in honeybee but i am not sure how to divide it into zones and proceed further to make an energyplus simulation.\u00a0\n\nThis is a single floor plan but i want to analyse the whole building which is 25-storyed\u00a0\n\nI have attached a GH file of the same and a screenshot (just in case).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/z6oYvgD0qBGVYWI5AM*5vTwD9D8tj5STPRZxMTydyeXDU9SNrIBZPMI-XlVI*H2FxSZwNQynpDCLTrZZG6VtoN7p4zXdvhnS/Untitled1.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/z6oYvgD0qBGVYWI5AM*5vTwD9D8tj5STPRZxMTydyeXDU9SNrIBZPMI-XlVI*H2FxSZwNQynpDCLTrZZG6VtoN7p4zXdvhnS/Untitled1.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1676119", "name": "highrise building_general floor plan.gh"}], "created_by_name": "nishant pandav", "created_at": "January 22, 2017 at 12:29am", "created_by": "nishantpandav", "topic": "Custom high-rise building floor plan for honeybee analysis", "id": "topic_1676120"}
