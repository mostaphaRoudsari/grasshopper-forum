{"body": "\nHi all, i have tricky issue to ask you about customizing Perez coefficient under ladybug/honeybee/Radiance. I need to improve the accuracy for solar radiation modelling for my projects. One of the solution is to adjust six sets of Perez coefficient using our measurement data for a whole year. I have checked source code of cumulative sky from ladybug and honeybee, but it seems the radiation modelling is built on Radiance gendaylit. So i checked the source code of gendaylit.c ([http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/gen/gend...](http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/gen/gendaylit.c?view=markup)), i found the constants coeff_perez[] that i need to replace by our coefficient. For this situation, is there anyone have experience that use customized Perez coefficients for ladybug or honeybee or Radiance? Thank you for you all in advance.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Le", "created_at": "March 17, 2017 at 1:34am", "created_by": "XULE", "topic": "change Perez coefficients for solar radiation modelling under Ladybug or honeybee", "id": "topic_1714193"}
