{"body": "\nSo I finally decided to take a crack at fixing this issue, and created a bundle which plugs in to the back-end of the ViewAnalysis component. It takes a acceptable viewing angle from the analysis' surface normal (ie, 70 degrees from normal will result in a 20 degree non-viewable angle, or the \"user defined\" note in the sketch in the original post). The view angle is a cone, so it doesn't mimic the new view angle component for Ladybug which alters the cone based on up/right/left/down.\n\n\n\nIt returns the analysis mesh (in black and white, but that is just a gradient component in the bundle), viewStudyResult and averageView. I've found this makes a huge difference when analyzing a buildings view potential to features and landmarks.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7XbQiMj5TFOf1*6ExboJL0TS-LSx4nWpzN-c8*luJNjbjmyNnT6g10uqK*WP89LDFLnNU*gj0TYYGBDnQ57oou-PQgq0eanG/2017061311_23_14GrasshopperViewanalysisRestrictedAngle.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/7XbQiMj5TFOf1*6ExboJL0TS-LSx4nWpzN-c8*luJNjbjmyNnT6g10uqK*WP89LDFLnNU*gj0TYYGBDnQ57oou-PQgq0eanG/2017061311_23_14GrasshopperViewanalysisRestrictedAngle.png)\n\n<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7XbQiMj5TFPOVoq1vxHgKnUSrNQypljAUSxgjJz-17KOw4wrZcv4tPxifKZ6kfPQfmNoeuRq61TI85zjDyf5XT28zFl-bvtA/2017061311_22_23UntitledRhinoceros5.0CommercialPerspective.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>\n\nThis seems to work great for my particular use case.
