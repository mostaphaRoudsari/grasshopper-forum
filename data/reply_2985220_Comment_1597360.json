{"body": "\nJi,\n\nFor hours that are outside the indoor temperature range, you can make sure that the HVAC turns on by ensuring that the zone isConditioned and setting the thermostat Setpoints on the\u00a0\"Honeybee_Set EnergyPlus Zone Thresholds\" to be larger than the\u00a0maxIndoorTempForNatVent_ (for cooling Setpoints) and smaller than the\u00a0minIndoorTempForNatVent_ (for heating Setpoint). \u00a0It's usually a good idea to leave at least 1 degree C buffer in between the\u00a0maxIndoorTempForNatVent_ and the cooling setpoint. \u00a0Otherwise, you get a rapidly cycling phenomena where the windows shut because it's too hot, AC turns on, zone temperature drops, windows open, and zone temperature goes up. \u00a0This whole ordeal wastes a lot of cooling energy.\n\nAlternatively, you can get creative with the nat vent\u00a0schedule\u00a0and HVAC\u00a0Availability\u00a0schedule to ensure that you never have nat vent and AC periods overlapping but I would recommend getting the hang of the method above before trying \u00a0this.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 11, 2016 at 4:09pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1596997", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1597360"}
