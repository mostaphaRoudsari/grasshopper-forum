{"body": "\nChristian,\n\n\n\nTo respond to your edited question, there is presently a dearth of research on how to forecast discomfort from radiant asymmetry. \u00a0The only study that seems to have a consensus around it is Fanger's original one that held the PMV of people in a cube-like\u00a0test chamber at 0 and just modulated the temperature of 1 of the 6 surfaces until the subjects felt discomfort.\n\n\n\nThe results give a super simple model that requires to you assume that the surface with a different temperature has the same view factor as you would have in a cube. I question how generalizable it is to many real-world cases. \u00a0Still, if you want to test for radiant asymmetry, I suggest that you use the \"local discomfort\" button on the [CBE tool](http://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/).\n\n\n\nSince the calculation is so simple, I don't see much purpose in putting in a special component in Ladybug/Honeybee (since you could calculate it with 1 or 2 native GH components).\n\n\n\nI hope this helps and let me know if you have any suggestions.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 30, 2016 at 9:48pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1493230", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1497129"}
