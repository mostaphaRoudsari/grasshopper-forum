{"body": "\nAbraham, Thanks for providing Nite with great support on this.\n\nJust to confirm the question that you asked about E+ versions, the last stable release from February uses E+ 8.1 and the most up-to-date version on the github uses E+ 8.2. \u00a0We have not yet updated Honeybee to 8.3 but I think that there is a good chance we will do this before the next stable release, which I imagine should be pretty soon.\n\nNite, it looks like all of the errors that you are getting with the successful simulation have to do with the specifics of your geometry so the overall E+ results on the zone level should be fairly accurate but values for individual surfaces will not be. \u00a0To fix the problem, you can either accept the surface-level inaccuracies and change the solar distribution type (what Abraham suggests), you can break up all of your L-shaped surfaces into rectangular surfaces (this usually fixes everything for me), or you can break up your single zone into 3 cube-like zones with air walls between them (this always works for me).\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 26, 2015 at 03:34PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1293872", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1295920"}
