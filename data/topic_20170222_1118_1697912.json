{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am running a solar radiation analysis in Ladybug (screenshot_01).\u00a0\n\nAs the analysis period is the whole year, it is generating the annual total radiation.\n\n\n\nIs there a way to extract these data and represent the hourly radiation in a 3d chart - similar to the ones we can get from the epw files (screenshot_02)?\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n\n\nElias\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1697910", "name": "Capture.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1697911", "name": "Capture2.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Elias Kateb", "created_at": "February 22, 2017 at 11:18AM", "created_by": "EliasKateb", "topic": "Radiation Analysis", "id": "topic_1697912"}
