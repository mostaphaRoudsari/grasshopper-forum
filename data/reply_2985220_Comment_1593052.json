{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\n\n\nI'm having a very tough time understanding what you are inputting into the Adaptive Chart component from your images. \u00a0I at least know that your prevailing outdoor temperatures are for Boston, which may not be the site that you are trying to evaluate. \u00a0If you upload a GH file or an image of the adaptive chart component, I could be of more assistance.\n\n\n\nThe degreesFromTarget is the number of degrees Celsius that your input conditions are from the centerline of the adaptive comfort polygon. \u00a0I added this output because I wanted to have something similar to PMV but for the adaptive model. \u00a0So, just like PMV, when the degreesFromTarget is\u00a00, you are at the most comfortable temperature possible, positive numbers are warmer than this, and negative numbers are cooler than this.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 3, 2016 at 1:26pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1593044", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1593052"}
