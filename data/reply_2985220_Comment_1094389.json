{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you very much for checking the files for my questions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRegarding the capability of DesignBuilder for\u00a0importing and exporting, you can see the file formats which DB allows to import and export from the images below and also from the HELP file of DB in attachments (Page 71: Importing Geometric Data; Page 78-80: Import 3 - D CAD Data). In their HELP file, they mention about \"import geometric data\".\n\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, regarding the input of schedules, loads, constructions and etc., DB normally uses \"Component \" and \"Template\" (Page 29: Templates And Components; Page 591: Templates; Page 533: Components). \"Templates\" are databases of typical generic data, including Activity templates, Construction templates, Glazing templates, Facade templates, HVAC templates, Location Templates, and etc. \"Component \" are databases of individual data items (e.g. a construction type, material, window pane).\n\n\u00a0\n\nBoth \"Component \" and \"Template\" are allowed to be imported and exported by using \"Import / Export library data\" command (.ddf format - DB Database File; Page 734: Import Components/Templates, Export Components/Templates). DB also allows us to build up our own libraries of templates and components (Page 731: Library Management; Page 733: Template Library Management).\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn order to import both geometric information and other information related to schedules, loads, constructions and etc. from GH to BD, we supposed the following two ways:\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. GH(HB+GB) --&gt; gbXML (both geometric and \"Component \" and \"Template\" information) --&gt; DB\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is the way we most prefer. We did see information related to schedules, loads, constructions encoded in the gbXML file generated by GB, but still do not know the reason why DB did not take this information (I also mentioned this in Q6 within the gh file). We assume this might because the gbXML file we create encodes the schedules based on a different template / schema than the one DB expects. We also post this question to the [DB](http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/component/option,com_forum/Itemid,25/sid,ac828b78ef7f1035357c5ac26786ac50/) forum for help.\n\n([http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/component/option,com_forum/Itemid,25...](http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/component/option,com_forum/Itemid,25/page,viewtopic/p,13755/#13755))\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. GH(HB+GB) --&gt; gbXML (geometric information only) + .ddf (\"Component \" and \"Template\" information only) --&gt; DB\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf the first way doesn't work and DB only takes geometric information from the gbXML, then we might think of the other way - generating the .ddf files from GH(HB+GB) to pass the schedule, load and construction information to DB.\n\nI was wondering if it is feasible for HB and GB to have this function? And what is your suggestion to achieve this?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn addition, we notice that DB can export XML files (not gbXML), so we are trying to figure out if DB also accepts / reads the XML file. If so, we might be able to convert the gbXML (with both geometric and schedule information) to XML. What do you think about that?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you again for all your help!\n\n\u00a0\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n\n\n\nDB import\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vcB-R4TFh6qxFbpiE7IdZV0ycrnvB1ofk2unVwvv3zooD0vpAycNPg5NghvzV7NeKwE0z38z-j*Unzqra4qRWHngeYrMqeH9/DBimport.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vcB-R4TFh6qxFbpiE7IdZV0ycrnvB1ofk2unVwvv3zooD0vpAycNPg5NghvzV7NeKwE0z38z-j*Unzqra4qRWHngeYrMqeH9/DBimport.jpg)\n\n\n\nDB export\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vcB-R4TFh6pvSQc8TR-C0hRQEKQoCvfrDSN1MCQzJxbJpElODvUeHsrAlPlYV5u8vs0sFyBxH-foR6LTXdN31thClhBlPag3/DBexport.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vcB-R4TFh6pvSQc8TR-C0hRQEKQoCvfrDSN1MCQzJxbJpElODvUeHsrAlPlYV5u8vs0sFyBxH-foR6LTXdN31thClhBlPag3/DBexport.jpg)\n\n\n\nTemplate libraries\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vcB-R4TFh6rJ1CSsXBDGN1roNlaaBv7yCUhZxejWC2Mouk6z*O4gL4LY5a4BBfptqBK4ySjfuEdrXqjH4T3*Efv5xli-oIbX/Templatelibraries.jpg\" width=\"392\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vcB-R4TFh6rJ1CSsXBDGN1roNlaaBv7yCUhZxejWC2Mouk6z*O4gL4LY5a4BBfptqBK4ySjfuEdrXqjH4T3*Efv5xli-oIbX/Templatelibraries.jpg)\n\n\n\nComponent libraries\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vcB-R4TFh6qqsP75CEnIaq1CziHsCHgsf4G-espDj1M9HGATsg2V4FOTEsIWhEjhFXw7jrYBiJc9U9d3mSa55sdzctA15lsG/Componentlibraries.jpg\" width=\"424\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vcB-R4TFh6qqsP75CEnIaq1CziHsCHgsf4G-espDj1M9HGATsg2V4FOTEsIWhEjhFXw7jrYBiJc9U9d3mSa55sdzctA15lsG/Componentlibraries.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "June 27, 2014 at 10:03am", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1093344", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1094389"}
