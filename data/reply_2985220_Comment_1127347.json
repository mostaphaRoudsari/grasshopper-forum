{"body": "\nHi Octagon26,\n\nAs I just mentioned in another comment. When I developed the update component I was assuming only developers would use it. It has a couple of limitation, and what you are posting here is one of them.\n\nThe current version of update components would fail if the number of inputs or outputs of a component is changed (which is the case here). Unfortunately for now you need to replace them manually from the tab. I will try to write a better component soon to address these limitations.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 6, 2014 at 9:45am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1127144", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1127347"}
