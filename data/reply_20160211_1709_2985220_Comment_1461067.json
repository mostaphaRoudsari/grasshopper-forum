{"body": "\nHi Iason,\n\nYour file runs fine and if you look at surface results you will see the solar gain through the window is there (attached!):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/I56XjtvsDcMj9UIWytDA9Ur0E21c-7sW18HJ4XVGFp3CSb-U5f-d-z*02aXr-bVguksuzt-lvbaT-a0K75L0Uxp1DkX7Rg4z/solarGains.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/I56XjtvsDcMj9UIWytDA9Ur0E21c-7sW18HJ4XVGFp3CSb-U5f-d-z*02aXr-bVguksuzt-lvbaT-a0K75L0Uxp1DkX7Rg4z/solarGains.jpg)\n\nThe confusion happens since solarGain output on zone results is actually \"Zone Windows Total Transmitted Solar Radiation Energy\" output in EnergyPlus. If you check EnergyPlus InputOutputReference you can see the definition below:\n\nZone Windows Total Transmitted Solar Radiation Energy [J]<br/>The total Surface Window Transmitted Solar Radiation Rate of all the **exterior** windows in a\u00a0zone.\n\nSince your room has no exterior window the solar gain is 0. I think we should add this to output description.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1461069", "name": "Livingroomsunspace_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 05:09PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1461310", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1461067"}
