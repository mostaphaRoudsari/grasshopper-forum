Check this\u00a0[Hydra](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Update_Ladybug_and_Honeybee).

You still need to replace some of the components manually since there have been changes in number of inputs or input names. Do you know about ctrl+shift and click that let's you re-connect multiple wires from a component to another? It shouldn't be hard to re-wire a couple of components if you use ctrl+shift+click:\u00a0[http://screencast.com/t/niXpaKJQ](http://screencast.com/t/niXpaKJQ)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 8:10pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412004", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412675"}
