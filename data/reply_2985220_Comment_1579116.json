{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nTo be honest, I didn't include an input for the fan energy because:\n\n1) It's usually VERY small in comparison to the other terms of the energy balance and I usually find that I do not want to include it just for the sake of clarity. Still, it doesn't hurt to give people the option of including it if she/he wants.\n\n2) Not all EnergyPlus models have all of the fan energy going into the air stream and (consequently) not all of it goes into the zone energy balance. \u00a0However, to date, all fan energy of Honeybee-generated models goes into the air stream so it's probably safe to say that this point is moot by now.\n\nGiven that I have just argued against my own reasons, I'll add an input for it very soon.\n\n-Chris\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 9, 2016 at 6:26am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1578781", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579116"}
