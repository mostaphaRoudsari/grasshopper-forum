{"body": "\n\n\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am getting \"Index Out of Range:0\" error when I run shading analysis. Interestingly Honeybee populates the results in its corresponding folder but for some reasons it does not visualize it!\u00a0\n\n\n\nPlease see the attached file. The red circle positions where error occurs in grasshopper. Since I do have the results, I attached the \"annual Simulation\" folder.\n\n\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7gV9LwHC4QuV0JNdGpESU9ScDg/view?u...](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7gV9LwHC4QuV0JNdGpESU9ScDg/view?usp=sharing)\n\n\n\nBest\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "saram", "created_at": "May 19, 2017 at 10:51am", "created_by": "saram", "topic": "Index Out of Range", "id": "topic_1754106"}
