{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nA co worker of mine is trying to generate a shading design from about 2700 sun vectors,unfortunately there are so many sun vectors that the component crashes.\n\n\n\nThe _timeStep_ is already set to 1 so I can't reduce the number of sun vectors apart from changing the length of the analysis period which I don't want to do.\n\n\n\nPerhaps I should write a component which will whittle down the number of sun vectors?\n\n\n\nI'm interested to hear all your thoughts,\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n\nAnton\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1742362", "name": "TooManyVectors.png"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "April 28, 2017 at 09:52AM", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "topic": "Ladybug sunpath to too many sunvectors to generate shading surface with shading designer", "id": "topic_1742363"}
