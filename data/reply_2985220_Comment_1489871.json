{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\n\n\nI will check the duplication issue once I get more time to sit down and check your file. \u00a0\n\nThank you so much for posting about the misplaced point in relation to the CBE tool. \u00a0It was a bug in the chart that only affected cases when you connect up single values to airTemperature, radTemperature and prevailTemp. \u00a0It was accidentally setting the prevailing temperature as the y-coordinate of the point and the operative temperature as the x-coordinate. \u00a0All other uses of the chart were good so that might be why I didn't notice it until you pointed it out here.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/nVneZuV00OjTjmQ8jqU2bF5L*StXzdTMvPrm3L9bFRHJHYogCr29z6YmujmcMNkS7GFRsiF5tZdiuKnuJVH**GJ0wn6BJFPK/AdaptFixed.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nVneZuV00OjTjmQ8jqU2bF5L*StXzdTMvPrm3L9bFRHJHYogCr29z6YmujmcMNkS7GFRsiF5tZdiuKnuJVH**GJ0wn6BJFPK/AdaptFixed.JPG)\n\nI fixed it in the attached file.\n\nThanks, as always, for your vigilant pursuing of bugs.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1489872", "name": "AdaptComfFixed.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 21, 2016 at 7:42pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489377", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489871"}
