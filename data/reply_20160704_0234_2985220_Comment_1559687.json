{"body": "\nHi Max,\n\nThanks a lot for your answer! It absolutely makes sense, but I still don\u00b4t understand one thing: if i input just one day as analysis period, i should have just one maximum and\u00a0 minimum values which adapt to my data stream, right? So in that case I should have a pronounced graph, right? But i have tryed and\u00a0I have not. Why?\n\nThanks again\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "July 04, 2016 at 02:34AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559625", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559687"}
