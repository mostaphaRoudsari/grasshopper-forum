{"body": "\nHello everybody!\n\n\n\nI've been trying to run an E+ Simulation for a single room. I've generated a custom shading and used it as \"shdSurface\" for the \"HB_EPContextSrf\" component. The Simulation does run, but once it finished I get this error message:\n\n1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/>\u00a0\u00a0 ** Severe\u00a0 ** GetSurfaceData: There are 50 degenerate surfaces; Degenerate surfaces are those with number of sides &lt; 3.\n\n\n\nCan sombody tell me how to find the degenerate surfaces and get rid of them?\n\n\n\nI attached the gh.-file and I'm using the \"Small objects - meters\" template for Rhino, in case that's important.\n\n\n\nThanks in anvance\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1434586", "name": "E+ Simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "S221B", "created_at": "January 08, 2016 at 12:39PM", "created_by": "S221B", "topic": "E+ context surface error", "id": "topic_1434587"}
