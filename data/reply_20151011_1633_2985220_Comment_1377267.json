{"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\n\n\nI have set up the file so that it would be able to run one E+ simulation. The parametric input part uses Mostapha's iteration process to change one parameter at a time and then run the new E+ simulation.\n\n- The Set EP Zone construction component is overwriting the constructions set to the surfaces from the building program template for each type (wall, floor, roof, etc). This component is just editing the constructions in other words and continuing the workflow to eventually run a simulation. If you have a look at one of the parametric inputs that I want to vary, you could see that I am changing the wall construction parametrically. The keywords need to be different to pull up the write construction from the library that I have created in the userCustomLibrary.idf\n\n- The concatenate function allows the naming of the files for the parametric input that has been changed. So when you first run a simulation, the name of the file is what the current inputs are set to. If you then animate the sliders, manually or using myslider component, then the file name will change when the parameter changes. This is simply a way to make sure no data is being overwritten.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "October 11, 2015 at 04:33PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1374806", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1377267"}
