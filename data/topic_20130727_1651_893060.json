{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI've been\u00a0working on my Dissertation when I found this fine tool and many thanks to Mostafa, it's been very helpful.\n\nWell, what I am working on is a kinetic facade (kinetic shading system)\u00a0which tracks the sun to cast shadow and/or produce electricity (using PV panels) more efficiently. However, my problem is that the facade follows the sun movement manually and I cannot have the whole day or month analysis since the analysis are done based either on Series component or Intervals, but my shading system moves based on the sun vector and time of the day. What I'm trying to say is that the geometry input for\u00a0Ladybug components\u00a0cannot\u00a0change respective to the time.\u00a0\n\nWhat I need is Ladybug to be able to get the appropriate geometry as it changes, and uses that geometry\u00a0according to the time which the given geometry belongs to! For example, the shadings change their local angle every hour as sun moves; also, they move around the building (from east to south and then to west facades) as sun changes its location accordingly. Therefore, the analysis results should be based on the geometry respective to the time\u00a0and location of the sun.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI don't know if I could explain the issue well enough, so if you think more explanation may help please do not hesitate to ask. I would appreciate any help or hint.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMany thanks,\n\nEhsan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Seyed Ehsan Ayatollah", "created_at": "July 27, 2013 at 04:51PM", "created_by": "SeyedEhsanAyatollah", "topic": "Ladybug and Kinetic Facade Design!", "id": "topic_893060"}
