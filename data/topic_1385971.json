{"body": "\nHello fellow ladybuggers.\n\n\n\nAs a new user of ladybug I find it difficult to understand what all these awesome graphs and charts mean. I can try and make some sense out of all this, but I feel like I just don't have enough knowledge and experience on how to translate all this juiciness into meaningful conclusions that I can later on give my fellow architects or colleagues (better in a gentle manner, so their brains won't go to space).\n\n\n\nCan anyone suggest the books or maybe videos on YouTube or just share their experience here. I think it will be helpful to any new ladybugger.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "October 25, 2015 at 10:11pm", "created_by": "Timur582", "topic": "Learning materials on how to interpret and understand ladybug analysis data.", "id": "topic_1385971"}
