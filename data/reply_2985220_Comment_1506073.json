{"body": "\nAntonello,\n\nThis is going to be really useful once it gets integrated. \u00a0I have played around with your file a bit and realized that your component is essentially the same as the shading designer except that you can specify a shdAngle when you connect up a sunVector (or a sunAltitude in your case). \u00a0Right now, the shades are always horizontal when you connect a sunVector and this prevents people from using it for cases like that here unless you angle the shades like so:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4-r35uyukEbTbDG*U*pnHp3Ch-UySPeU*pIhdTU*4Kl9l4myS60lTpwJCxvwmUVrosrvbm55yn2IjCBg8bXBnvzer03Vct9C/AngledShades.JPG\" width=\"635\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4-r35uyukEbTbDG*U*pnHp3Ch-UySPeU*pIhdTU*4Kl9l4myS60lTpwJCxvwmUVrosrvbm55yn2IjCBg8bXBnvzer03Vct9C/AngledShades.JPG)\n\n\n\nAntonello, if you could integrate your current work in a manner that allows you to set the shadeAngle when someone connects up a sun vector, I think that will be the best of all worlds.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions on this or on the shading designer.\n\n\n\nAlso, I noticed that you should give people the option of setting the angle of the shades by U or V. \u00a0Otherwise, it is easy to generate shades facing the wrong direction like so and in the attached file:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4-r35uyukEaDO9jojOpuQVqUpyTPOVfpq9kSq*k7KjXlJH-s5ciX2m*N2W8RnzxXa3Khsr8OUeXS42XJgeeSVYitr83SmKcK/WrongDirection.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4-r35uyukEaDO9jojOpuQVqUpyTPOVfpq9kSq*k7KjXlJH-s5ciX2m*N2W8RnzxXa3Khsr8OUeXS42XJgeeSVYitr83SmKcK/WrongDirection.JPG)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1506075", "name": "example_Horizontalshadingsurfaces_newVersion_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 11, 2016 at 1:19pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1501589", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1506073"}
