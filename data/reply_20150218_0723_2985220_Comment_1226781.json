{"body": "\nHi Chien Si, Theodoros,\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you for your replies. Indeed a common library to input data in EPD form is basically all it takes. Structural components were used only because I wanted to hook up my plugin with another plugin performing structural optimisation that we developed in our university lab. Structural components are again material with properties so the only thing you look for after your modelling is the total volume per material. The \"format\" I used for my tool was basically a local database in visual studio. Easy to work with, populate and handle on servers if needed. The question becomes where will this be stored and if populated by users how do you update and also how do you make sure that the data are robust? \u00a0\n\n\n\nI didn't know about the BCL but is a great discovery for me! I am not really using OS and E+ mainly through other programs so these kind of stuff are not often under my radar.\u00a0\n\n\n\n@Theodoros\u00a0\n\n\n\nDo you have EPDs in .pdf form? If so with some (or a lot) of manual work we could even copy the data using a pro reader. If anyone has a nice way to do this would be great!\u00a0\n\n\n\nLooking forward to work on this direction!\n\n\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 18, 2015 at 07:23AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1226019", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1226781"}
