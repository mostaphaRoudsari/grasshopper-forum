{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI've tried different geometry but the results was almost the same:\n\npercentTimeOfComfortable (without contextShading) = 46.130\n\npercentTimeOfComfortable (with contextShading) = 38.595 ?? (is it supposed to be larger than 46.130 ?)\n\nAnd it is getting lower to 36 when I set up the groundRefectivity to 0.9, which is make sense because of the Concrete ground.\u00a0\n\nThank you\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1453552", "name": "different geo_Perspective.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1453553", "name": "BUS 2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Bao Nguyen", "created_at": "February 02, 2016 at 11:37PM", "created_by": "BaoNguyen", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1453461", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1453551"}
