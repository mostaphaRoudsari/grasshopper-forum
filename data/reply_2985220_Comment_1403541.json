{"body": "\nHi Ludvig,\n\n\n\nI've actually made an update to the PV generator component to make the warning more clear. Please find it in the attached file.\n\nThe issue here is your geometry. Before we go any further can you simply your geometry so that you are not using 266 surfaces? e.g geometry of the same size can be merged into one.\n\n\n\nBasically one of the geometry pieces is too small to mount a panel of that size (300 W) on. Therefore the surface area is greater than one and it doesn't work - see the new error in the component.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1403542", "name": "PVdiscussionratioerror AJZ 11.18.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "November 18, 2015 at 11:32am", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1403039", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1403541"}
