{"body": "\nThanks Leland and Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI have created one spikey vector thing, which has a basepoint of 0,0,0 and displays the direction and intensity of solar irradiation.\n\n\n\nWhat i really want to do now, is create the entire cactus, which represents a building geometry and corresponding point grid, where the spikey vector thing is applied to each point over the grid.\n\n\n\nThis may be what Leland is suggesting, however i found it difficult to feed the SDL line component with the proper information to simply map the spikey thing to each point on a grid covering (say) a box or some arbitrary geometry. Assuming that gets working, i could then tweek the vectors to display the irradiation properly based on law of cosine.\n\n\n\nHave a look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1106564", "name": "skyVectors_idea1.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1106565", "name": "Screen Shot 2014-07-25 at 10.24.57 PM.png"}], "created_by_name": "Octagon26", "created_at": "July 25, 2014 at 11:34pm", "created_by": "Octagon26", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1106516", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1106562"}
