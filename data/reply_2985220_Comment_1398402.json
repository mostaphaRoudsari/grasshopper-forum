{"body": "\nHi Marwan,<br/><br/>Both \"Tilt and Orientation Factor\" and \"Sunpath shading\" components have \"precision\" input.<br/>It controls how smooth the calculation mesh is, and therefor how precise the results are.<br/>I am attaching a similar\u00a0tof_Oregon_Portland.gh example definition to initial topic's photo.<br/><br/>As for the numerous PV surfaces inputed: Each output geometry for each PV surface is located in its own branch. So you just need to use the grasshopper \"Tree branch\" (or \"Explode tree\") component to identify the shading diagram you would like to see. Check the attached Photovoltaics shaded analysis.gh.\n\n<br/>Thank you for the kind words.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1398403", "name": "tof_Oregon_Portland.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1398404", "name": "Photovoltaics shaded analysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "November 11, 2015 at 11:02am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1397873", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1398402"}
