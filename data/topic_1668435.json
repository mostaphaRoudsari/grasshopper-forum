{"body": "\nHi every one\n\nI have a double skin kinetic facade and\u00a0I am trying to model that in honey bee ... I made two separate zones ...first: my room....and second: the zone between two skin.\n\nNow I want to model this zones to energy analyses in honey bee.\n\nBut I don't know with witch component I can add kinetic skin to analyze?? Windows Shade generator or which one???\n\nI can,t find appropriate tutorial to kinetic facade simulation.\n\nRegards\n\nMoein\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1668434", "name": "kinetic facade problem.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "moein", "created_at": "January 8, 2017 at 3:06am", "created_by": "moein", "topic": "connecting kinetic facade in honey bee problem", "id": "topic_1668435"}
