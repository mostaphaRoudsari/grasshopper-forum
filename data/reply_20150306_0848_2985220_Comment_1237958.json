{"body": "\nThanks for posting, Abraham!\n\nThis looks like a a much simpler/easy-to-understand way to do it. \u00a0So you would assign your material to a HB window and plug the shading control object into \"additionalStrings\" of the Run Simulation component. \u00a0I imagine a lot of other cases where this might be useful such as cases where the insulation of the glazing is changing, etc.\n\nThanks again for letting us all know about it.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 06, 2015 at 08:48AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1235247", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1237958"}
