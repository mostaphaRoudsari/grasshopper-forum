{"body": "\nPardon me for bumping into this old thread, this was the only I could find regarding Revit.\n\nI'm looking for a plugin for my workflow (all models done in Revit, import to GH -&gt; simulate -&gt;make changes in Revit -&gt; import again -&gt; Simulate, etc.).\n\n\n\nI've checked the videos of the plugins from this group ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/gh-revit](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/gh-revit)), also checked Mantis Shrimp.\u00a0\n\nThey look promising but they seem geared for those who know how to model in Rhino/GH (I don't).\n\n\n\n[CASE](http://www.case-inc.com/)\u00a0in particular seems plausible but when I checked the videos, it didn't export the walls, doors. Is there a workaround for this?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pin", "created_at": "June 11, 2016 at 7:38am", "created_by": "Pin", "parent_id": "topic_1177037", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1545933"}
