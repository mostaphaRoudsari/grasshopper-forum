{"body": "Hi Claudio,\nThank you for the references.\n\nSince HB uses Daysim, I checked what they say on http://daysim.ning.com/page/keyword-daylight-autonomy\n\nActually it seems to be calculated on the whole occupancy period you set, therefore:\n\n\"The daylight autonomy depends on the illuminance requirements of the user, occupancy hours, and the status of the blinds throughout the year\"\n\nIf you haven't set any occupancy period the default is set 8-17 Mon-Fri.\n\nI hope this could help you,\n\nClaudio", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "June 18, 2014 at 04:30PM", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "parent_id": "topic_1090211", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1090351"}
