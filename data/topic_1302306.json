{"body": "\nHi guys, this is the message I get when trying to run simulations on files I've been developing the past 4-5 weeks. I had no problems with them previously, haven't used them for 1 week and tried to run them again but just get this message each time. I haven't changed the files since I last used them. Stumped. Just re-uploaded simplified files which give same error message. Can you help? Cheers, Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Robert Doe", "created_at": "June 4, 2015 at 7:11am", "created_by": "RobertDoe", "topic": "1.
