{"body": "\nHi Erik,\n\n<br/>a) How do you modify the position of the secondary x-and y-axes? And how do you make them invisible?\n\nWhat are the secondary x, y axes?<br/>Are they these green and purple lines:<br/><br/>\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/qC4m5tLZ02ZSHugR-4cT2lal3Vmm3sBrh-wlgu4d8Q8iAMvBjYDtQE8nzUo2NIqVVVAbsV8HXwXXlB5-9cJh4y6Vh2oFx7pe/TOF_mesh_edges.jpg?width=250\" width=\"250\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/qC4m5tLZ02ZSHugR-4cT2lal3Vmm3sBrh-wlgu4d8Q8iAMvBjYDtQE8nzUo2NIqVVVAbsV8HXwXXlB5-9cJh4y6Vh2oFx7pe/TOF_mesh_edges.jpg)\n\n?<br/><br/>If they are, then you determine their position and number by the \"precision_\" input. Their number is equal to \"precision_ - 1\".<br/>They are essentially mesh edges, not curves. To hide them, in Rhino application menu choose: Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; View -&gt; Display Modes -&gt; choose your current display mode, and uncheck the \"Show mesh wires\":\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/qC4m5tLZ02aGm6iX6byXqt06cQ5NK4-OOp2m96jMBK-1cQii6p8fS1Ze8H*pzGvi1hBKyHznToczCuhggu0SRdJ1kEQ0ykOt/uncheck_mesh_wires.jpg?width=250\" width=\"250\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/qC4m5tLZ02aGm6iX6byXqt06cQ5NK4-OOp2m96jMBK-1cQii6p8fS1Ze8H*pzGvi1hBKyHznToczCuhggu0SRdJ1kEQ0ykOt/uncheck_mesh_wires.jpg)\n\n\n\nb) How do you change the x- and y-scale of the chart? For instance displaying every 10 degrees of azimuth?\n\nCan you be a bit more precise?<br/>You would like to change the labeling of the azimuth directions from 30 degrees step to 10 degrees step? If this is so, you can not do that.<br/><br/>\n\n<br/>c) My input surface is a hyperbolic paraboloid, facing south symmetrically. How does the component calculate its tilt and azimuth?\n\nAll Ladybug Photovoltaics components calculate the amount of AC energy generated by a planar (flat) surface. Tilt and azimuth angles are calculated based on surface normal at 0.5, 0.5 surface parameters. So you can not use the hyperbolic paraboloid as the _PVsurface (or _PV_SWHsurface) input, as it will yield incorrect results. You need to planarize that hyperbolic paraboloid surface first.<br/>I attached below an example with default grasshopper components, but the size of the panels is not equal. If you want them to be equal use some paneling Grasshopper plugin like\u00a0[Lunchbox](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/lunchbox?ufh) or [Paneling tools.](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/pt-gh?ufh)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1567884", "name": "TOF_parabolic_hyperboloid.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 18, 2016 at 11:14AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "topic_1567599", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1567882"}
