{"body": "\nDear expert,\n\n\n\nI'm working with a complex geomtry. I've decided to divide the geometry for material (int_wall, ceiling, floor, ecc) and then associate every material at the respective honeybee surface. The problem appears when I run the simulation because the values of illuminance on the grid are really high like if the grid was \"an plein air\".\u00a0\n\nI've then checked the file geomtry.rad, that hb use for the simulation, in radiance and really the geometry is wrong (partially present) . But the surfaces seem be right in the grasshopper canvas as you can see in the image and into Rhino view (every surface is highlighted).\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/dnCWvahr*CqKxSiBnXrRBWBaYUzIiuzzPcve0Q1HM386-hVpHE-bDGxzghOBFc9lbvj1OKEMAT1HK8twCjTVcmvItoX9VXO2/Cattura.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/dnCWvahr*CqKxSiBnXrRBWBaYUzIiuzzPcve0Q1HM386-hVpHE-bDGxzghOBFc9lbvj1OKEMAT1HK8twCjTVcmvItoX9VXO2/Cattura.PNG)<br/>Any advice??\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nGiuseppe\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "July 13, 2014 at 12:55PM", "created_by": "GiuseppeDM", "topic": "Complex geometry", "id": "topic_1101630"}
