{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI'm having some trouble reading the results from the ReadEPResults.\n\nAs suggested by Mostapha, I provided to check the definition about the zone conditioning, setting by defult as conditioned.\n\nActually, I had no trouble with the EP engine. Instead, I found \"Empty parameters\" in every section of the connected cvs file.\n\n\n\nIn the attachment you can find the definition, which regards one zone. So, it should be easy to solve, but I've no clues anymore.\n\n\n\nI notice that I have the same problem with Chris tutorial 7 - Importing Zone Level Results and Visualizing Them.gh :(\n\n\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nKind regards,\n\nMarco\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1193738", "name": "Schermata 2014-12-22 alle 10.49.18.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1193739", "name": "HB trial.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Marco P", "created_at": "December 23, 2014 at 7:38am", "created_by": "MarcoP", "topic": "ReadEPResults - Empty parameters", "id": "topic_1193740"}
