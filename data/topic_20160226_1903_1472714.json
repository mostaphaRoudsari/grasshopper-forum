{"body": "\nIn using Mostapha's [Integrated Daylight and Energy file](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Integrated_Daylight_and_Energy_simulation&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=8&amp;offset=-3658.8616705976265,-2128.1713822547777), I noticed a discrepancy in the lighting profile that is created with the ReadAnnualResult component. I compared the original lighting schedule, which has a 0.2 - 0.5 lighting fraction in the evenings with the generated profile, which has a 1.0 lighting fraction in the evenings.\n\n\n\nI'm guessing that this component assumes lighting is 100% required if the lighting fraction is greater than 0.2 and if daylight isn't sufficient. However, I would prefer that if daylight isn't sufficient, the continuous (not binary) lighting fraction is taken from the original schedule.\n\nDoes anyone know how to essentially merge these schedules? I think I could do this by exporting to excel, using a couple excel formulas and re-importing, but I would prefer to stick in Grasshopper.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBelow is the image of the Office::OpenOffice occupancy schedule, the generated lighting annual profile, and the Office::OpenOffice lighting schedule. I've circled the area in the evening where I'd expect/prefer the generated lighting profile to have a fraction similar to the original lighting schedule.\u00a0[<br/><img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KtdNBL2ZfJA8GJSPKW5e1uiZRBst*eFi5zTLGdEgstRArRlobcHQgvnQwRb5TREyP10Jl0T4v9ucI3YcC3ou0YaznmUac7HK/ScheduleDiscrepancy.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KtdNBL2ZfJA8GJSPKW5e1uiZRBst*eFi5zTLGdEgstRArRlobcHQgvnQwRb5TREyP10Jl0T4v9ucI3YcC3ou0YaznmUac7HK/ScheduleDiscrepancy.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lizzie Adams", "created_at": "February 26, 2016 at 07:03PM", "created_by": "LizzieAdams", "topic": "Annual Profiles - lighting fraction is higher than original schedule fraction", "id": "topic_1472714"}
