We can have a component to overwrite ground temperature but looks like you need to overwrite the values for every single hour?\n\nAnother interesting point, since the area that is enclosed under water will be a living space is to see how we could simulate the heat gains from the direct sun on the underwater surface, if any, and how we could simulate also the heat exchange between the space and the water body. Would this follow the sae behaviour as the heat exchange between inside and outside air?\n\n\n\nSounds like some interesting multi-phase CFD studies unless someone has already come up with an equation to model this. I can tell you that this is not something that you want EnergyPlus to do. The only energy simulation software that might be capable of modeling this to some extent might be transys but I know very little about Transys to make a comment. There are others on the group who can answer to this question.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 12, 2015 at 9:31pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223374", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223763"}
