{"body": "Luciano,\n\nGlad that you were able to get it working. My guess is that it had something to do with the last thing you did (download the UWG.zip). The Dragonfly_Dragonfly component is supposed to download this file in the background the first time that you drop itnon the canvas but something might have been stopping this from happening on your machine. I should write an error/warning message if this download fails.\n\nI'm also happy to hear that you plan to use the UWG to inform your thesis. The most comprehensive documentation. That exists right now is in Bruno's PhD thesis (Bruno being the original developer):\nhttp://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/59107\n\nThere's also some documentation on the urban microclimate group website:\nhttp://urbanmicroclimate.scripts.mit.edu/uwg.php\n\nI know that many of the original UWG functions come from a Linux program called Town Energy Budget (TEB).\n\n\nThe FatalError messages that you are getting in the command prompt are likely the result of a bug in the UWG. I had discovered several when I first started working with it, particularly if you specify really thin materials on the constructions. If you post an issue to the UGW github with a link to the XML file generated by Dragonfly, I imagine Joseph should fix the bug soon:\nhttps://github.com/hansukyang/UWG_Matlab\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 21, 2016 at 04:48PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1513198", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1513532"}
