{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,<br/><br/>thanks for your fast response. I tried it with creating a \"custom lamp\" in a \"dark sky\". I'm not sure if I figured it out yet but for now my problem is: no matter how much test points I have the \"rundaylightanalysis\" takes about 50seconds for a result.\u00a0<br/><br/>Attached you'll find \u00a0screenshots, the grasshopper definition and a test surface in rhino.<br/><br/>As i need the results for an iterative optimization process, I wonder if there is an easier and faster way to get the radiance on a surface from a single custom light source?<br/><br/>thanks, Julian<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Just in case you wonder. The project is about a physical kinetic model which has 5 lux sensors to evaluate the position of the sun/light source. With this information I want grasshopper to optimize the form of the model to gain maximum solar radiation for example.<br/><br/><br/>\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1725672", "name": "test_lux_surface_definition.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1725673", "name": "test_lux_surface_geometry.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1725674", "name": "test_lux_surface_screen_1.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Julian Jauk", "created_at": "April 2, 2017 at 5:11am", "created_by": "JulianJauk", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1725450", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1725670"}
