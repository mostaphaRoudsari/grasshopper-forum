{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nSorry that I never got back to you 3 months ago. \u00a0Your surface result component was not working because you did not request for EnergyPlus to write the surface information into the eio file (the eio file only includes zone information). \u00a0By default, the run simulation component requests this info in the outputs section of the IDF and you will have to do the same with your IDF if you want it to work with the ReadEPSurface component.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/viirmOBcoEHi2viylIygSit0LguIrIFDnbmC5Ylws9fZ0pd7LKovGQyKfotq6asr14SP3CfiIifiUsXIIRhrRDIQHfC-18M1/noSrfInfoIneio.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/viirmOBcoEHi2viylIygSit0LguIrIFDnbmC5Ylws9fZ0pd7LKovGQyKfotq6asr14SP3CfiIifiUsXIIRhrRDIQHfC-18M1/noSrfInfoIneio.jpg)\n\n\n\nThe total cooling energy should be coming through but it is written in the csv as \"ILAS_ZONE_01:Zone Ideal Loads Zone Total Cooling Energy [J](Hourly)\".\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/viirmOBcoEGwmSgPqY233h41CJDd37H2OQ*Ep6QRBI4DOVw60b2q8gW62-zX8*q2BV52wGPR*LsZVHFBO17YcPZO4Li0D1CQ/WeirdSyntax.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/viirmOBcoEGwmSgPqY233h41CJDd37H2OQ*Ep6QRBI4DOVw60b2q8gW62-zX8*q2BV52wGPR*LsZVHFBO17YcPZO4Li0D1CQ/WeirdSyntax.JPG)\n\nDo you know why the ILAS is in front of the Zone Name? \u00a0this is causing it to fail at the moment and, if this ILAS is a common thing written into IDFs, I can code in a way to deal with it.\n\n\n\nImporting building-level outputs will be easy once we get the SQL result parser off of the ground.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 29, 2015 at 6:11pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1370893", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1370806"}
