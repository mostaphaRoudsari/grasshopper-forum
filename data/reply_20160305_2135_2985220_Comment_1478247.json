{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks for your time spending with my question and also sharing the NCDC website.\u00a0\n\nThe component which you have been working on would be great! Just let us know when is it released?\n\n\n\nRegarding my case location, you got it right, Ardal County at Chaharmahal Bakhtyari Province is in Iran. The only base EPW file you can find is from Esfahan where has the common border with Chahrmahal.\n\nAlso, I've received the Total Solar Radiation(TSR) file as well, which is attached, here. Could this file helpful?\n\nMay you please let me know how I can access to the EPW file that you have produced for my site?\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nYalda\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1478248", "name": "TSR- Ardal.xls"}], "created_by_name": "Yalda Sourani", "created_at": "March 05, 2016 at 09:35PM", "created_by": "YaldaSourani", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1478034", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1478247"}
