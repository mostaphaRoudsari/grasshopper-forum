{"body": "\nRegarding the sky resolution issue, Daysim (in Honeybee) is limited to 145 patches.\n\n\n\nThat being said, I think your model can be improved. Mirror material is probably not the best choice for architectural studies like this. You are better off using the \"metal\" material instead. Considering that your model has dense geometry around the glazing, it might be useful to do a single climate-based point-in-time simulation to ascertain how the ambient parameters (divisions, bounces, resolution etc) affect the results and then use those parameters for the annual simulation.\n\n\n\nBy forward raytracing, were you referring to Photon Mapping? If yes, I think in this scenario, annual simulations with out-of-core photon mapping will give you far more accurate results than Daysim based simulations.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "June 04, 2017 at 07:56PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1763281", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1763674"}
