{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI have already used\u00a0\"EnergyPlus Window Shade Generator\" for venetian blinds and it is a great component! Compliments!\n\nI have two questions about this:\n\n- perforated screen effectiveness depends on openness factor, holes diameters and thickness. How is it possible to set these characteristics using energy plus shade material?\u00a0\n\n- I am trying to simulate complex geometry shading device using shading coefficient approach. I have created a shading plane with\u00a0\"EnergyPlus Window Shade Generator\" and put a shading schedule but the results are quite similar to no shading case.\n\nCan I use this method? Is there any wrong settings?\u00a0\n\nIn attached you can find the gh file and .csv\n\n\n\nThank you so much.\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nAndrea\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1498889", "name": "Test1.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1498890", "name": "Louvers_shading_2020.csv"}], "created_by_name": "Andrea Zani", "created_at": "April 02, 2016 at 08:40AM", "created_by": "AndreaZani905", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1497247", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1498887"}
