{"body": "\nHi Helena,\n\nThe execution happens as soon as you connect the image path to the component. The issue that you're mentioning is almost always because of the permission issues in Windows. When it runs from inside the component it doesn't have the same privilege as when you double click on the batch file.\n\nCan you try the attached file? I changed the way the component executes the batch file. Let's see if this will make any difference.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1433669", "name": "steve_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 07, 2016 at 05:37PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1433478", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1433667"}
