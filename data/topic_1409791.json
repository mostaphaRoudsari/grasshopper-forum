{"body": "\nHi! I'm having problems running the daylight analysis after the recent update. The recipe is for daylight factor.\n\n\n\nThe error I'm getting is \"Solution exception:index out of range: 0\" in the runDaylightAnalysis component. I've appended an image of the error message.\n\n\n\nI've reinstalled everything and also ran the update component. The honeybee component seems to be updating to a new date (nov_24_2015) but the other components stay at (nov_07_2015). They are all the same version 0.0.58.\n\n\n\nAnyone have any idea what might be the problem?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1409790", "name": "error 1.png"}], "created_by_name": "Carl Molander", "created_at": "November 26, 2015 at 1:24am", "created_by": "CarlMolander", "topic": "Problem running daylight analysis", "id": "topic_1409791"}
