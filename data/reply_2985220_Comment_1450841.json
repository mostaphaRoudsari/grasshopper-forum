{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\nThe air material is very important as almost every construction has some sort of air gap in it and it is often important to use the THERM air material to model the radiant heat transfer of this gap correctly. \u00a0Thank you for posting about this.\n\nAll of the THERM materials are stored in a file called\u00a0thermMaterial.csv that is in your Ladybug Default folder. \u00a0The file is supposed to update when I post a new version but this feature was not working if you had a very old version of the library.\n\nCan you verify that the air material shows up in the most recent version of this example file?\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=THERM_Window_Frame_Construction&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\nIf so, all of your future GH files should include the air material in the library.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 30, 2016 at 8:19pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1449641", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1450841"}
