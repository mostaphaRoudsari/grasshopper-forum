{"body": "\nHello Guys,\n\nI was wondering if somebody could help me with a simple question, I have been trying to analyse the daylight in a public space during the whole year.\n\nThere is any way to have an average day using that period? So the range of my table is going to be in a daily basis showing between 0 and 8 hrs instead of from 0 to 92 hrs.\n\n\n\nMany thanks and congrats for this awesome tool!\n\n\n\n**Nico**\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4hNukqhfhE1uVNiDXBGkV4lOvHsd*qnf0G3A8cWojgdo946OohGX6ygjxpCVpbRWMB0GE-jMZcNofBXhuTkTW5t2lSrge64y/2b.jpg\" width=\"700\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4hNukqhfhE1uVNiDXBGkV4lOvHsd*qnf0G3A8cWojgdo946OohGX6ygjxpCVpbRWMB0GE-jMZcNofBXhuTkTW5t2lSrge64y/2b.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nicolas Cabargas Mori", "created_at": "October 08, 2014 at 05:15AM", "created_by": "NicolasCabargasMori", "topic": "Daylight Average for One day in a whole year period.", "id": "topic_1145327"}
