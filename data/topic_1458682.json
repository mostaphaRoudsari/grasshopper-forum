{"body": "\nHi there!\n\nI am trying to validate some results i get from a honeybee energy simulation, and i am getting high discrepancies whenever i turn on the infiltration (meaning the air-leakage, unwanted infiltration that is supposed to be occurring through the building fabric). Is there a possible way that i could set the energyplus infiltration model coefficients through honeybee? There should be 4 such coefficients: A.Constant coefficient, B.Temperature coefficient, C. Wind speed coefficient (linear) D. Wind speed coefficient (quadratic).\n\nthank you!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iason Bournas", "created_at": "February 9, 2016 at 7:42am", "created_by": "IasonBournas", "topic": "Infiltration model in Honeybee", "id": "topic_1458682"}
