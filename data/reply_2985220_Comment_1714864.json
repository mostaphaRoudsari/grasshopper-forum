{"body": "\nRafael,\n\nGlad that the Outdoor Comfort Calculator solves your issue. \u00a0I should also add that, for the csv's that I've used in my own studies, I usually try to keep the file size down by rounding off each windspeed t ~3 decimal places (you don't need more than this for comfort studies). \u00a0I will say that, for my studies with a couple thousand points, it usually takes 30 seconds for Grasshopper to load up the CSV into the comfort recipe component. \u00a0So, for 12,000 points, it might take around 3 minutes (assuming that your data is formatted with 3 decimal places).\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 17, 2017 at 2:37pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714432", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714864"}
