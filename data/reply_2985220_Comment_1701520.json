{"body": "\nYes, that's why I pointed out [their webpage with this photo](http://www.model.envi-met.com/hg2e/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=800&amp;media=apps:screenshot_overview.png).<br/>My argument was that: if we are comparing the results then also the parameters need to be the same.\n\nIf nothing is added to the\u00a0**clothingInsulation_**\u00a0input of \"Body characteristics\" component, it will calculate the\u00a0clothes thermal insulation. While in your case, a fixed value of 0.9 is used in BioMet. The same goes for **metabolicRate_**: it\u00a0is using a value of 135 W/m2 by default (2.32 mets), while in BioMet you seem to be using some other value.<br/>All of this may not affect result much, but at least the parameters for comparison are the same.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "February 27, 2017 at 8:29am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701452", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701520"}
