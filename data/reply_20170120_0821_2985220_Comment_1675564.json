{"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\nI think i get why you are getting what you say.\n\nYou are applying twice the north definition when you connect it both to the sunpath and to the sunlighthours.\n\nThe sunpath transforms the sunposition once and this is the new position that you should take for the calculations. When you connect the north rotation to sunlighthours you transfor once again the vector for the sun.\n\nSo you need to have it connected only once, and i suggest doing it to the sunpath. In this way the viewFromSun will give you a meaningful information.\n\nMakes snse?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 20, 2017 at 08:21AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1675555", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1675564"}
