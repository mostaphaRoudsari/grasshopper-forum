{"body": "\nHey Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for the reply. What if the adjacent zone extends only in a part of the shared wall. Is it ok if I split the curve to extrude the surface or do I have to actually split the surface itself?\n\n\n\nAlso, what does cannot be shared mean exactly? Isn't it sharing if the adjacent surfaces going to be shared?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance. Simple matter probably but it's getting me all mixed up.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 26, 2015 at 11:34pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1273924", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1273775"}
