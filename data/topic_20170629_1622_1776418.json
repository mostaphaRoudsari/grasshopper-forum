{"body": "\nGood afternoon\n\nI've just started learning ladybug and honey bee. I've successfully did some small simulations with fewer zones and fewer thermal walls, and decided to try some larger projects. However, there are some problems I could not solve and hope if you can offer some help.\n\nIn this project, I tried to create few zones with walls and several interior windows. When I ran the simulation, I received \"index out of range:0\n\nI met this issue when I ran simpler files before. I assumed it was caused by interior windows therefore I tried to remove all interior windows. However, after I did that, only outcome I can get from EP result was windowTransmissivity\n\n\n\nIn order to find out what is wrong, I tried to disconnect all interior walls and just connect zones to simulation, but got the same result. I also tried to remove air wall and just ran simulation with just zones, but still did not walk. Could you please help me take a look?\n\n\n\nThank you\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1776415", "name": "Broken.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1776416", "name": "Library 3.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1776417", "name": "Sim 2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Considering", "created_at": "June 29, 2017 at 04:22PM", "created_by": "Considering", "topic": "Issue regarding interior wall, windows, and air wall.", "id": "topic_1776418"}
