{"body": "\nThanks Chris. This is annoying when it happens ... (loosing the reply). When the response is long i usually copy it , just in case ... :-)\n\nAs i said i normally download the github package and drop all of it in the UserLibrary. Then i see what items were changed and what wasn't. In this way i noticed the ones i mentioned.\n\nThe last 2 i've not used before, so no particular interest for me. The first one, i do use. I didn't check that the name changed. So sorry for calling this alarm.\n\nThanks again,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 7, 2016 at 8:44am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1577867", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1577765"}
