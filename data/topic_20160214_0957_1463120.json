{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI have a question since i thought i had it clear but now i don't.\n\nI defined an individual surface as a wall. Defined the EPBC as adiabatic and also but right after the definition i connected this geometry to the HB_makeAdiabatic component.\n\nI expected that when creating the IDF file this surface will be registered as a \"surface\" (i.e. internal wall). Now revising the idf i see that this surface is registered as \"Outdoors\". So, no way, that the adiabatic condition will be applied or taken into consideration for the simulation.\n\nAm i missing something?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 09:57AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "Adiabatic or Outdoors", "id": "topic_1463120"}
