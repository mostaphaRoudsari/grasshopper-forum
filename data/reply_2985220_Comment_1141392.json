{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nAbraham, All your comments are correct (as usual). As Chris mentioned sky can be as dense as you want. There is no limitation. The reason that I put limitation on genCumulativeSky is that it can take very long for denser skies and it won't do that much for accuracy of the results.\n\n\n\nAlso looking to Kostas image it might be a good idea to break the top surface also in pieces so it gives more accurate results.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 2, 2014 at 4:48am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1141353", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1141392"}
