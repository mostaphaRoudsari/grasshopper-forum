{"body": "\n\n\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI am trying to run a \u00a0radiance study where I measure the cumulative solar radiation on a grid over the year - (grid based simulation type 1)\n\n\n\nHowever I am confused as to how to set the solar gain properties of the glass which is in front of the grid. How do I do that? As far as I can see only the visible light transmittance properties of the glass can be set.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/FZRGychDo8CuIJ7xXH53MFdCUuDlfGyqJg0gz4SBqhPV88fLs1wy*86ao0I92C3brAIhZiAJNnI2puim4ISru8f*00eSTQUo/Visionglass.JPG\" width=\"607\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/FZRGychDo8CuIJ7xXH53MFdCUuDlfGyqJg0gz4SBqhPV88fLs1wy*86ao0I92C3brAIhZiAJNnI2puim4ISru8f*00eSTQUo/Visionglass.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "May 5, 2016 at 8:15am", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "topic": "Radiation analysis set solar heat gain of the glass", "id": "topic_1523715"}
