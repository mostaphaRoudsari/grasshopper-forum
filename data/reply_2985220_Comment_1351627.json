{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\n\n\nThanks for your message yes the shading will be taken care of. Since you are passing a HB generator system to E+ run file you must connect \u00a0it to HBgenerators, the context surface that the PV generator is mounted on will automatically be taken into account.\n\n\n\nEven if you were to also connect the surface to\u00a0**HBContext_ \u00a0**it wouldn't make a difference.**<br/>**\n\nIf there's anything that you think that could be more user friendly or if you have any user requests do let me know.\n\n\n\nLove your picture by the way, what is it? A gopher?\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "August 30, 2015 at 10:28am", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1350698", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1351627"}
