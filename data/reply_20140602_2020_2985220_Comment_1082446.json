{"body": "\nHi Orn,\n\n\n\nDaysim is developed on top of Radiance but it has a different approach to the simulation. There are multiple publications but I would suggest you to read this paper if you want to only read one:\n\n\n\nBourgeois D, Reinhart CF, Ward G, \u201cA Standard Daylight Coefficient Model for Dynamic Daylighting Simulations\u201d Building Research &amp; Information 36:1 pp. 68 \u2013 82, 2008.\n\n\n\nI assume you have already checked Daysim home page. Just in case you haven't you will find more resources on the page:\u00a0[http://daysim.ning.com/](http://daysim.ning.com/)\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 02, 2014 at 08:20PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1078844", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1082446"}
