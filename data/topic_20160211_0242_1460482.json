{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am trying to do a\u00a0Cumulative Radiation Analysis study of a landscape.\n\nI have tried using\u00a0mostaphaRoudsari's script from Hydrashare, however having some troubles getting it to work.\u00a0\n\n1. When I run the script even with a large grid size (that I understand speeds up the run time) it still freezes for 20mins and forces me to restart my machine.\n\n2. If i connect a point component to testpts to see the test sampling, the points are not visible.\n\nMaybe I am missing something, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTest files attached. (rhino file too big to upload) site is\u00a01639073 x\u00a01243694 mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1460481", "name": "Cumulative_Radiation_Analysis_Edited.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Paddyf123", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 02:42AM", "created_by": "PADDYFernandez", "topic": "Cumulative Radiation Analysis from large landscape", "id": "topic_1460482"}
