{"body": "\nAntonello,\n\nThis is awesome! \u00a0I always had a sense that this method could be improved. \u00a0Send a pull request with the new component when you get the chance. \u00a0Even if it's written in rhinoscript instead of rhinocommon, a slower component that never fails seems better than a fast component that fails and we can always try to change the rhinoscript over to rhinocommon later. \u00a0Also, I can re-write that incorrect description once you send the pull request.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 11:42am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1516628", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519155"}
