{"body": "\nHey Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for sharing the file! That's amazing. I will be using your workflow to conduct yearly outdoor thermal comfort studies once my CFDs progress and a fast way to get me started is what the doctor ordered :)\n\n\n\nI do have a question though, I apologize in advance if it is obvious I've never run this to know the intricacies. Do we care about the type/typology/size/ etc. of the zone if we are only focusing on outdoor temperatures? I have two adjacent buildings on a public realm I'm studying but these buildings are one big box atm. Is it crucial to define specifically the facade (i.e. material distribution) and the use of the zones to get accurate results or is one big ass zone enough for a good assessment?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 5, 2016 at 6:26am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1454878", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455452"}
