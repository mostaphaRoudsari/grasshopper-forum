{"body": "\nHey hi guys,\n\nI\u00b4m reaching out due an issue I\u00b4m dealing with after using the Ladybug-AdaptiveComfortCalculator. Basically the zones of my model are reporting a percent ofability above 93%, while also reporting 41% of the time to be in extreme weather conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAditionally, I\u00b4m also running an analysis with the Ladybug_AdaptiveComfortChart, where the charts are displayed in Rhino, yet the outputs of the component doesn\u00b4t provide any data.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny guidance would be appreciated!...<br/> Cheers,\n\nAlejandro[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"424\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/EMVKhgUIcMtAnsWak69RLeNC8ZaTd3v7capup3vSyHw6rgW309bjQ6YpSXFvGGLdYIAvQqZvqChSQ2axLyUPZ*M-tw5SeTvr/Ladybug_AdaptiveComfortCalculatorIssue.png?width=750\" width=\"649\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/EMVKhgUIcMtAnsWak69RLeNC8ZaTd3v7capup3vSyHw6rgW309bjQ6YpSXFvGGLdYIAvQqZvqChSQ2axLyUPZ*M-tw5SeTvr/Ladybug_AdaptiveComfortCalculatorIssue.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1312419", "name": "AdaptiveComfortCalculator.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Gamas", "created_at": "June 20, 2015 at 2:19am", "created_by": "AlejandroGamas", "topic": "Ladybug_AdaptiveComfortCalculator-Issue", "id": "topic_1312420"}
