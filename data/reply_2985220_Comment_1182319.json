{"body": "\nPeter,\n\nThank you for posting a detailed response and I believe that I have discovered what the issue is in your case. \u00a0I should be clear that this seems to be different from the issue that Alejandro was first experiencing, which I think was the result of the names of surfaces changing in different runs of his energy simulations.\n\nI your case, Peter, I believe that it results from using an old Indoor Radiant Temperature Map component with a new Ladybug_Ladybug. \u00a0A couple of weeks ago, I put some new text formatting functions into Ladybug_Ladybug, which makes things like the text of legends and titles display more nicely in the Rhino scene. \u00a0I know that it will cause that \"too many values to unpack\" error if it is used with old components that have legends.\n\nAs long as you input zones that are closed into the view factor component, you should not get an error that tells you otherwise. \u00a0I know that, with the surface-by-surface method, I sometimes mistakenly make zones that are not closed because certain surfaces are grafted when I input them into the createHBZones component. \u00a0Could this be what is happening in your case?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 5, 2014 at 7:45pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1179795", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182319"}
