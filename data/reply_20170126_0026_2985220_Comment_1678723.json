{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThank you for your review.\n\nYes. It's easy to color the meshes inside the component. The thing is, we want to leave the choice of colors in the hands of the users. And to do that, the way I see it, we will have to add two more inputs to the component for colors. Will you be ok with that?\n\nThanks,\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "January 26, 2017 at 12:26AM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678530", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678723"}
