{"body": "\nHi Ben,\n\nSorry for taking so long to get back. \u00a0I can tell you what the error means: the component is saying that the schedule for Outdoor Air (OA) is already in your openStudio library. \u00a0So my guess something is going wrong in the download of the OpenStudio libraries that automatically happens when you drag and drop the HB component onto the canvas the first time.\n\n\n\nWhat is your internet connection like on your machine? \u00a0Is is stable? Is there a firewall or anything that could block your access to the site app.box?\n\n\n\nThere is a workaround for this if this is so. \u00a0You will have to download the openstudio libraries here:\n\n[https://app.box.com/s/y2sx16k98g1lfd3r47zi](https://app.box.com/s/y2sx16k98g1lfd3r47zi)\n\nand then copy and paste them into a folder that you create in this location of your computer:\n\nC:\\ladybug\\openstudio\n\n\n\nIf there is a folder there already, then delete it.\n\n\n\nMy guess is that something similar might be happening for Ladybug and the Radiance functions that it downloads and uses. \u00a0I can give you more instructions if this first workaround helps.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 30, 2014 at 11:56AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1138809", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1140021"}
