{"body": "\nHi Chris and thank you for your answer.\n\nI believe this is clear now and should be clear before. But now i think there is a misunderstanding in the use of the component or the definitions/inputs in it. Probably for this case Ludvig should be using the HB_EPWindowShades ONLY for the external shades (that should be used as context, as Chris said), and use the HBZones output from the previous used (in the flow of the connected components) HB_createHBZones. In this way there is no need to split the window in smaller parts as Saeran did.\n\nBTW, i didn't find the 1 mt limitation in the definitions ...\n\nBTW #2, What are the assumptions of the slats angle, and other definitions that are not in the component's input?\n\n\n\nHope this makes some sense now for all of us.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 25, 2016 at 12:23AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1645721", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1645746"}
