{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Giuseppe,\n\n\n\nI am not able to reproduce the error that you are finding. I have however updated all your components to the latest version of Honeybee you can do this by downloading the latest components from Github -\u00a0[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/tree/master/userObjects](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/tree/master/userObjects).\n\n\n\nAfter updating all the components on my machine the simulation runs smoothly. Let me know if this GH file is what you want.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nAnton\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1378667", "name": "Eplus_model AJZ 10.14.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "October 14, 2015 at 9:27am", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "topic_1378487", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1378665"}
