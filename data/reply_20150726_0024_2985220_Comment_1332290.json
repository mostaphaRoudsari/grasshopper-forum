{"body": "Well Grasshope, I think you are rising a point that has some issues.\nI'm also surprised the geometry is not there. But checking the hints of the component i'm seeing how it works (not that i definitely understood fully).\nFirst, i created the IDF to see what is going on there. I see that the component contributed a Blind deinition. The blinds are not geometrically defined, only as shading elements for the window. So for me this is a good think since a was not aware of it.\nIf i understood right, in order to get the geometry you need to have a simulation done and some of the results connected to the ZoneData inputs (Chris will explain broader this point, i'm sure).\nSo what i will do in your case, until further notice, is to take the ShadeBreps output and connect them to a HB_EPContextSrf component. For your simulations DON\"T connect (or use) the HBObjWShades output of the EPWindowShades to the runEnergySimulation (or any other component that uses or changes the zones definitions), but instead use the previous component (in your case the HB_glazingCreator).\nMessy enough ...? :-)\n\n-A.", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 26, 2015 at 12:24AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1332422", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1332290"}
