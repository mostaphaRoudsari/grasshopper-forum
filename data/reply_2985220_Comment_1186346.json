{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI'm having a problem with the RadiantTempMap component. It is complaining about **Runtime error (KeyNotFoundException): srfTemp.**\n\nThe attached file is only one zone of a more complex building. Tried to isolate the problem, since the whole building is, of course, not working either. In the file i reconstructed the whole surfaces and zo nes definitions (it is based on an imported geometry from sketchup, and i rebuild using surfaces). For the whole building the suggested error was related to the Tolerance of the model. This is not the case in the attached/single zone.\n\nWhat am i missing?\n\nI'm attaching also the whole building file, but just be aware that the simulation can take a few minutes ...\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1186347", "name": "Caldwell-TestOneZone.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1186348", "name": "Caldwell_01.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 11, 2014 at 12:09pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183025", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1186346"}
