{"body": "\nHi Claudia,\n\n\n\nThe difference between these maps is that the first one comes from some conditional statements - e.g. if the DF is greater than 2 set this color.. this function doesn't generate gradient colors, you have written a treshold function. While, the second map follows a gradient function, you have remapped values inside a domain of colors.\n\n\n\nSorry, I don't understand well what type of map do you want to reach (with gradient colors or treshold colors).<br/>Could you clarify this for me?\u00a0thanks.\n\n\n\nAntonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "February 15, 2017 at 4:44am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "topic_1691941", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1691972"}
