{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am trying to get the average illuminace (lux) in a plane of a test geometry for a given period of time. I'm am only able to get the cumulative radiation.\n\nI would like to compare different period of the year and asses the quality of daylight during this periods.\n\n\n\nIs there a way to get this values to get a list of all the hours on the selected periods and get the average illuminace? Can it be plotted?\n\n\n\nThank you for your help.\n\n\n\nJuan Carlos\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1584253", "name": "geometry.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1584254", "name": "AverageIlluminance.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1584255", "name": "GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Juan Carlos Fornino", "created_at": "August 19, 2016 at 7:20am", "created_by": "JuanCarlosFornino", "topic": "Average Illuminance (lux) Levels", "id": "topic_1584256"}
