{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nYou ask a very interesting question and one that is related to a lot of things that I have been thinking about after reading the recent books that Nicol and Humphreys have written.\n\n\n\nMauricio,\n\nBecause the Adaptive methodology is founded upon the notion that there are hundreds of social factors that influence comfort and that the best we can do to forecast comfort is to find variables with good correlations to these social factors (like outdoor temperature), the premise that these published Adaptive model holds regardless of cultural norms is dangerous. \u00a0Notably, the founders of the adaptive model have stressed that this particular linear correlation that you cite comes from recent surveys of buildings where people have both the the ability to open windows AND a great\u00a0freedom to dress down. \u00a0Hypothetically, if occupants were able to open the windows in Abraham's building but the cultural norm was that everyone was expected to wear multi-layered suits or dresses (as in historic Britain), a different correlation between outdoor temperature and comfort temperature would exist. In fact, historical European comfort surveys show that people likely preferred cooler temperatures in buildings (about 1-2C cooler) than today's occupants. Accordingly, after recognizing this social premise in the Adaptive model, I have built in a few ways to adjust/alter the version in Ladybug based on the literature I have read (even though these alterations are not a part of any official ASHRAE or European standard).\n\n\n\nAbraham, you might have to be a bit more specific about how you would like to adjust the Adaptive comfort model for me to help your particular case and this may lead to me adding in new functionality. \u00a0For the time being, I can tell you that the '**Ladybug_Adaptive Comfort Parameters**' component is going to be your friend and I would recommend using the Adaptive Comfort Chart to visualize how you are changing the model. \u00a0You can plug these '**Adaptive Comfort Parameters**' into the '**Adaptive Comfort Recipe**' component to have the microclimate analysis run with these parameters. \u00a0Here are a few examples of how to alter the model:\n\n\n\n**1) Mixed-mode Building** - Humphreys and the European Adaptive comfort team derived two separate correlations.\n\nOne for naturally ventilated buildings:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNhM*5g*lbisD8PzjuJcPAE2p4AKIg7hRWhPLpKbfnw7W6H-JhisyvCQg1HvuNeIZKv5JZfv4YXTmOINedjaq4qy/NoCondit.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNhM*5g*lbisD8PzjuJcPAE2p4AKIg7hRWhPLpKbfnw7W6H-JhisyvCQg1HvuNeIZKv5JZfv4YXTmOINedjaq4qy/NoCondit.JPG)\n\nand conditioned buildings:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNgi8TI5UMIQqVYmV-276HeW*yTMsxGBT18UhbAy-9uuUwxYsP0QfX6KRqqnmTsN4OIZ7LkAM76n7o*RXDOYe6MZ/Condit.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNgi8TI5UMIQqVYmV-276HeW*yTMsxGBT18UhbAy-9uuUwxYsP0QfX6KRqqnmTsN4OIZ7LkAM76n7o*RXDOYe6MZ/Condit.JPG)\n\nThe dimensionless value between 0 and 1 for _levelOfConditioning allows you to create different correlations depending on whether occupants have complete freedom of dress and window operability (0) or have slight restrictions like in a mixed mode building (0.5, for example):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNhdqfQ1OKOsmRZp1umV6Dh5rF6kfk0NMLTFJORN7lovJQSlRPx3-qhUY2KN-70UmMSHJ09bZgLiQXNfY3Nwep2U/05Condit.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNhdqfQ1OKOsmRZp1umV6Dh5rF6kfk0NMLTFJORN7lovJQSlRPx3-qhUY2KN-70UmMSHJ09bZgLiQXNfY3Nwep2U/05Condit.JPG)\n\n\n\n**2) Changing Response Time of Occupants** - There has been a bit of a debate in Literature about whether it is better to use the average monthly temperature or a weekly running mean temperature. \u00a0The avgMonthORRunningMean input allows you to adjust this like so:\n\nAverage Month:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNiUiN0GT87S2Ry3M1UCb8srEwTqPfJzJ5zlbwzQSyedGzcfKv2Sk6Gal9T-Cj9eXq40n5FmgYBXvjUr41bLJsQj/AvgMonth.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNiUiN0GT87S2Ry3M1UCb8srEwTqPfJzJ5zlbwzQSyedGzcfKv2Sk6Gal9T-Cj9eXq40n5FmgYBXvjUr41bLJsQj/AvgMonth.JPG)\n\nRunning Mean:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNjNMxv3qkHT4nmXAHFfnkwTa5-HaYCmrfmAeKETHDGLpvEkdX58xnS-KgWC5GqzySDAGfU6PucPq0cWM7ZqFDkX/RunningMean.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNjNMxv3qkHT4nmXAHFfnkwTa5-HaYCmrfmAeKETHDGLpvEkdX58xnS-KgWC5GqzySDAGfU6PucPq0cWM7ZqFDkX/RunningMean.JPG)\n\n\n\n**3) Greater Temperature Range Tolerance -** While this last one is actually a part of the European and Adaptive standards, you can adjust the range of the comfort band with either the 'eightyOrNintetyComf' input or the comfortClass input like so:\n\nNinety Percent Comfortable\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNhyKyyG0kGX4N1ddg1e3GmPyN6GcJOVR3CeqH2nXO2Fmcm0-CnHGLP7xtdHTICH2PsSWtn-wsfXKtgwaZa0jL65/Ninety.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNhyKyyG0kGX4N1ddg1e3GmPyN6GcJOVR3CeqH2nXO2Fmcm0-CnHGLP7xtdHTICH2PsSWtn-wsfXKtgwaZa0jL65/Ninety.JPG)\n\nEighty Percent Comfortable\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNhxr-vJlep5krWlMHgvbC3SXQSclK5VFA1Pg3VD5X2LmbEp1jbbY0cAO6SL9gaSiSQZ8qKCRUS7FeZTiSME-ECa/Eighty.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k4bPQ8WfDNhxr-vJlep5krWlMHgvbC3SXQSclK5VFA1Pg3VD5X2LmbEp1jbbY0cAO6SL9gaSiSQZ8qKCRUS7FeZTiSME-ECa/Eighty.JPG)\n\n\n\nAbraham, let me know if you would like more controls over the model or if this is enough to do what you are thinking of. \u00a0This example file allows you to construct the images I have above:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Adaptive_Comfort_Chart&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 15, 2016 at 7:06pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463500", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463809"}
