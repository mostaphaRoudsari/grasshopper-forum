{"body": "\nHello everyone, i saw this component called Honeybee_Daysim User Profiles and i want to use it in my simulation, but i couldn't figure where i should connect it. And also i keep getting this warning from it after i connect 0 for _lighting control_ and _blind control_ : \"1. A place holder for now. For now all the Daysim simulations will be run for an active user profile. The implication of the user profiles is technically so easy but can be really confusing for the users. Need more thought.\". Lastly, i want to know what kind of data i should put in the _frequency_ input: some percentage or a schedule?\n\n\n\nThank you all for your attention.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ycvwLIslca64kz70JhK5lQiJX05GLsVW5LNKgvkIp5hJY-AV5AZp*OpoIrK8gL0BpzjUl4NK6DSuKs6sgWJrGqfShpI2yyx-/Capturar.PNG\" width=\"676\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ycvwLIslca64kz70JhK5lQiJX05GLsVW5LNKgvkIp5hJY-AV5AZp*OpoIrK8gL0BpzjUl4NK6DSuKs6sgWJrGqfShpI2yyx-/Capturar.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Allyson Carvalho Silva Santos", "created_at": "December 20, 2016 at 6:58am", "created_by": "AllysonCarvalhoSilvaSantos", "topic": "Problem with Honeybee_Daysim User Profiles", "id": "topic_1660533"}
