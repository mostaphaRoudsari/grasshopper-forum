{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, thanks for your reply!\n\n\n\nI assume the name of glazing is useful when we want to compare the results for specific glazing surfaces, or understand the \"behavior\" of a particular glazing such as heat transfer before and after we change its materials or constructions.\n\n\n\nCan you kindly advise the ways to access and assign glazing name?\n\n\n\nMoreover, may I ask if there is a way to filter zones or surfaces by their names. For example, I have several zones named in this convention: zone_[floor]_[roomType]_[orientation] (e.g. zone_floor01_Bedroom_east). So, how to choose those all the bedrooms facing west from floor 02-05 by their names to visualize results for these zones or to edit their zone properties?\n\n\n\nI hope my explanation is clear...\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 9, 2015 at 11:00pm", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1340914", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1340839"}
