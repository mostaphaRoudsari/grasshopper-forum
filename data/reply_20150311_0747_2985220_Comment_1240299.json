{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nThank you for your reply. I think assigning the right material or not is not influencing the daylight analysis basic results. Does it? For the basement I am trying to get results for, the daylight penetration is 0 for any given height till I reach the defined \"Air Wall\" I tried to create. Once I exceed this height I get results back as expected and I follow step by step the examples for Air Wall definition that Chris has provided. Please if you do find the time to indicate the mistake on my definition I would be grateful! In any case thank you for the input!\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am attaching again the gh definition and two screenshots. The first is the Daylight analysis for 1.45m offset from the basement level (so 5 cm under the defined \"Air Wall\") and the second is the same analysis for 1.55m offset from the basement level (so 5cm over the defined \"Air Wall\"). I think is obvious that the \"Air Wall\" is not considered as an \"Air Wall\" but as a normal geometry!\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1240301", "name": "AIRWALL_Construction_EP&RADanalysis.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1240302", "name": "1,55m offset from Basement level.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1240303", "name": "1,45m offset from Basement level.png"}], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "March 11, 2015 at 07:47AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240267", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240299"}
