{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nI admit I might have been a bit more enthusiastic than I intended. I have only thought of the case of a conditioned/unconditioned component. I'll try and brainstorm some more but I know that I will probably come up with something else only through modeling.\n\n\n\nOne note would be, if it is possible of course, to be able to output the zones by name (if provided in the create zone component) and not as referenced breps? Please correct me if that is there somewhere. I am not sure this merits a component of its own, but it would greatly help selecting zones after the are separated by these components (since in complicated models I usually go around using an external simulation log and not the actualy geometry).\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 6:49pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1278909", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1278806"}
