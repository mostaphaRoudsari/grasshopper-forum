{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and mohamed,\n\n\n\nThank you for your quick answers!\n\nI updated the Version, now theres another Problem. As long as i don't plug in the Shadingsystem it works fine, but when i do it says \"All of your HBSrf must make a closed Volume\".\n\nI tagged it with \"Outdoors\" and the SurfaceType is set to \"Shading\" so it should not be seen as part of the closed Volume.\u00a0\n\nI attached the new File. Maybe someone has an Idea\n\n\n\nChristian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian", "created_at": "January 8, 2016 at 3:00am", "created_by": "HamletPvD", "parent_id": "topic_1433093", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1433985"}
