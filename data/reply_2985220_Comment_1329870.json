{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nYes I do: TheodoreGalanos\n\n\n\nSounds good. I mainly deal with 3D cases but I'm sure I can get a simple 2D example from OpenFoam. By the way internal cases can be more complicated than external, we can also start from a simple external as well. I have more of those.\n\n\n\nSnappyHexMesh it is then, makes for an easier transition for me. Whole other science the meshing though. Rhino is also excellent for stl creation to feed into snappy. Anyways, I'm blabering again, we'll talk more on github. Will get the case running. Excited!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "July 21, 2015 at 8:54am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1329657", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1329870"}
