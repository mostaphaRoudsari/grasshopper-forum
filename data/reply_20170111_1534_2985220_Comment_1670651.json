{"body": "\n\n\nHi\u00a0Moein,\u00a0\n\nRefer to your email as your case study is near of mine, Chris &amp; Mostafa helped me to finish my study &amp; to understand that half of your solution is to understand what you need to get as an output so you will know the inputs needed.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nfirst, you need to upload your facade gh file with your question so they can understand your problem and help you.\u00a0\n\nsecond, as Chris said to you just need energy plus component plugged to\u00a0Honeybee_Set EP Airflow\u00a0as input with the zone you need to study &amp; you will get the air flow rate within the results ( that what I have done ), but if you need to get air flow simulation you will need CFD tool.\n\n\n\nhere's my case study discussion, I hope it will help you.\u00a0\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/urgent-conn...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/urgent-connecting-kinetic-facade-problem?xg_source=activity)\n\nMona\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "January 11, 2017 at 03:34PM", "created_by": "monarezk", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1670200", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1670651"}
