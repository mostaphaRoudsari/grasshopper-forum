{"body": "\nIt is the case for both.\u00a0 I was thinking it could have been an issue with attempts at downloading. I'm stuck behind a rather strict corporate firewall.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI noticed that Openstudio_standards.json was one file that was attempted and blocked, so I got a copy of that downloaded separately.
