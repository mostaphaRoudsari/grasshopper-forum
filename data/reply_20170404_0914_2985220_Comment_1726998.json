{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for your help previously. Could you please have a look at my old post below about msh2rad not rotating geometry? Would be appreciated as it's still an issue and I know no workarounds except only using CreateHBSrfs which can be unstable for me with some geometry (GH crashes).\n\n\n\nIf you want proof of the rotation not taking place using MSH2RAD, please look in the Daysim*.rad file that gets created when performing a Daysim simulation.\n\n\n\nSee example below. The same polygon is processed via the CreateHBSrs component and via the MSH2RAD component. The polygon gets rotated 90 degrees using CreateHBSrs but unfortunately not with MSH2RAD:\n\n_______________\n\n\n\n##GENERATED BY HONEYBEE\n\n\n\nOPAQUE polygon b69a317a402d42c1994f410463cd_0<br/>0 0 12 -15.824400 -5.615800 0.000000<br/> -15.824400 -44.175400 0.000000<br/> -15.824400 -44.175400 28.363100<br/> -15.824400 -5.615800 28.363100\n\n\n\n# SOURCE FILE: c:\\ladybug\\000000_TEST\\SURR\\MSH2RADFiles\\SURR.rad\n\n<br/>## c:\\radiance\\bin\\\\obj2rad -f c:\\ladybug\\000000_TEST\\SURR\\MSH2RADFiles\\SURR.obj<br/>## OBJ file written by TurtlePyMesh\n\n<br/>OPAQUE polygon object_1.1<br/>0 0 12 44.175400 -15.824400 28.363100<br/> 5.615820 -15.824400 28.363100<br/> 5.615820 -15.824400 0.000000<br/> 44.175400 -15.824400 0.000000\n\n\n\n_______________\n\n\n\nAll the best\n\n-M\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "M.
