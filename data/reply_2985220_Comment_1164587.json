{"body": "\nHey Chris,\n\nLet's take it as a good news that number of downloads is as much as that dropbox can't handle it anymore. They suspend my dropbox account a couple of times and we need to find a new place to host the files, but then it needs updating all the files and potentially new release.\n\nFor now I just copied all the files that Honeybee and Ladybug download to users system here so if anyone has download issues you can give them this link: ([https://app.box.com/s/bh9sbpgajdtmmystv3n4](https://app.box.com/s/bh9sbpgajdtmmystv3n4))\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 8, 2014 at 9:18pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163773", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1164587"}
