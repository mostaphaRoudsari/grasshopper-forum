{"body": "\nDear Mostapha, I also have a doubt about shading: in Honeybee, I need to obtain values of DA in a room based in variations of position, dimensions and solar reflectance of the outdoor surrounding buildings. Is Honeybee capable of consider this kind of urban influence in indoor daylight outputs, which is generated by the inter-reflection of solar beam within an urban canyon? Any recommendations? Thank you in advance for your answer!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iara Santos", "created_at": "August 29, 2016 at 12:16PM", "created_by": "IaraSantos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1588674", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1590428"}
