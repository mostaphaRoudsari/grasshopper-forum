{"body": "\nHi I am using the integrated daylighting and energy analysis for multiple zones for the first time.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI chose to use one honeybee thermal zone component with branched data for closed breps and getting some errors esp. with the energy component. Does this have to do with how the 3d models are or how I am using the HBzones component?\n\n\n\nFor some reason the daylighting analysis component is taking more than half an hour to analyze 9 rooms of total area probably about 3000 sq.m. ish. (with the sampling point at .5 m density - current the definition has 5 m grid so that when you open the definition it doesn't take all your cpus) I am hoping that the solving the whole definition takes about a minute at most. What are some good ways to shave off time? Have a lot more floor spaces to analyze :)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UsllNZ3m1eR*EPJolREGC1fl3YRhol6ncl7K2Ej7KnnH*Fe0LozJYDdVVJKChfctG5XB9Dvw0SH3qAShpSoYcL5sFUng1Y0u/2017022700.00.45.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UsllNZ3m1eR*EPJolREGC1fl3YRhol6ncl7K2Ej7KnnH*Fe0LozJYDdVVJKChfctG5XB9Dvw0SH3qAShpSoYcL5sFUng1Y0u/2017022700.00.45.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UsllNZ3m1eS57SVYeG1TRpDthSvGLgsDdeqB1CZPcsa6DVWPpeaOvvB3yAT0I7zMeSqDT2OFsL1*Mt6YcYL*CZekpZVm*Ip3/2017022701.46.59.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UsllNZ3m1eS57SVYeG1TRpDthSvGLgsDdeqB1CZPcsa6DVWPpeaOvvB3yAT0I7zMeSqDT2OFsL1*Mt6YcYL*CZekpZVm*Ip3/2017022701.46.59.png)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1700837", "name": "education_wing_honeybee_simulation.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1700838", "name": "GBS_06M12_11_048082.epw"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1700839", "name": "Integrated_Daylight_and_Energy_simulation_yj_20170227_classroom_2am.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "February 26, 2017 at 11:01am", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "topic": "keep getting errors Integrated daylighting and Energy analysis for multiple zones", "id": "topic_1700840"}
