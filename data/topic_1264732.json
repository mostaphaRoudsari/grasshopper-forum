{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI found a small issue on the\u00a0Honeybee_Run daylight Simulation component. As you can see from the screenshot the done output return True even if the simulation didn't even started, but just for the fact that the Rad file (?) has been written and actually the result folder created. Is it something wanted? Because this create some problems when planning many simulations one after the other in a \"cascade\" style, where the following could start when the previous end using the True in the done output of the previous as input in the the runRad input of the following simulation. Thank you.\n\n\n\nbest\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Gk-Khs5Ug5Onz9obYwopwrTTjQ6fHdYIH4R70WjaNkZBB6evdjtoe8NxcBPFgmKKCG2jTfHjHtlwRR3qab9d8JrdnJtHT7XX/notdonebuttrue.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Gk-Khs5Ug5Onz9obYwopwrTTjQ6fHdYIH4R70WjaNkZBB6evdjtoe8NxcBPFgmKKCG2jTfHjHtlwRR3qab9d8JrdnJtHT7XX/notdonebuttrue.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "April 16, 2015 at 2:08am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "Small issue - Honeybee_Run daylight Simulation done output", "id": "topic_1264732"}
