{"body": "\nJulia,\n\nNot so obvious.\n\nOn my view it depends what tools are you using in order to get an answer to your questions (Mostapha, correct me if i'm wrong. I know you will).\n\nUsing the sunPath you can pick the type of time you want (Solar or civil) with the boolean _solarOrStandardTime_ input. Though it doesn't give you winter/summer time. I believe next version of LB_Tools will allow that *but not completely sure).\n\nIf you use other tools like radiationAnalysis or HB with radiance, it takes solar time, since it is depending on sky definitions.\n\nHope this makes sense.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 09, 2017 at 03:51AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1688225", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1688179"}
