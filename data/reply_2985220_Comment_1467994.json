{"body": "\nAh, I should have read Ludvig's post before writing back here. Never forget the importance of refreshing the browser.\n\nMy guess is that it is related to the rhino tolerance and how Rhino stores the coordinate data. \u00a0Because Rhino stores all coordinates as floating-point values (that I believe are 16-bit), it only keeps the point data accurate to a certain number of decimal places (1 of\u00a02^16 different values). \u00a0If your coordinates get so far from the Rhino origin with so many digits, the accuracy of the coordinates might become coarser than the Rhino model tolerance, causing Honeybee components that use this tolerance to behave weirdly.\n\nMoving your geometry closer to the origin is the safer solution but you could have also made your Rhino model tolerance coarser (by typing the 'Units' command in the Rhino toolbar and changing the tolerance) or you could have adjusted the tolerance_ input of the \"Solve Adjacencies\" component to get it to work.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 21, 2016 at 9:50am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1468033", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1467994"}
