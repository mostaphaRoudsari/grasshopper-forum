{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThat sounds good ... but complicated. I'm not sure if this will be the \"final\" solution for the shading and shading control. Sounds more like a temporary one. If so, i'm not sure you like/want to do that.\n\nIn the meantime, i've just get an answer from the helpdesk regarding the issue qith the equivalent materials. It reads so:\n\nYou must use Construction:WindowEquivalentLayer with all *EquivalentLayer materials. The problem with the dropdown lists in IDF Editor has been corrected. For now, you need to paste or type in the material names.\n\nSo as we suspected there is a bug, but not a big one on their side. We just need to use the Equivalent definitions all the way and not just with the blinds.\n\nI tried to put this together (see attached, red group with ??? marks), but get an error that says:\n\n1. layer_1 is not a valid material name/definition.<br/>Create the material first and try again.\n\nSo, i think it will be easier to implement this new Construction type ... is it?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1187054", "name": "SimpleEnergySimulationBase_Blinds_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 13, 2014 at 12:03am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1185917", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1187053"}
