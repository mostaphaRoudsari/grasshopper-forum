{"body": "Mostapha,\nI can attest to the fact that the OpenStudio component really needs some love right now. I just put the functionality of natural ventilation into the OpenStudio component and the it seems we are all at fault for not maintaining the code so well. I also just updated the component to the most recent version of OpenStudio (1.9) that works with E+ 8.3 and put the new OS v1.9 dlls onto our github. Make sure that you update you OS libraries before you make changes.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 24, 2015 at 08:30PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1385275", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1385487"}
