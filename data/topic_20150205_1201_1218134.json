{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI am trying to simulate a houseboat. A zone is partially underwater (2/3 of it) and I was wondering how I could simulate this condition in Honeybee. For now I simulated as underground but the conditions are different and the temperature of the water fluctuates more than the one of the ground. Any thoughts?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\u00a0\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 05, 2015 at 12:01PM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "topic": "Under water simulation", "id": "topic_1218134"}
