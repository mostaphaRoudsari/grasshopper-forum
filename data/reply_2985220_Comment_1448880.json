{"body": "\nSee attached,\n\nIt is working but is not \"healthy\".\n\nThere is a problem with the analysisPeriod component and the results obtained from different simulations. I mentioned this issue in another discussion (can't recall which one).\n\nSee at the right the yellow group. Instead of connecting the analysisPeriod to the HB_MicroclimateMap i connected a HOY. It works and shows the selected hour, but ...\n\nThe legend shows a wrong month (March instead of April). When you go to hour 17 it crashes also. Don't understand why.\n\nNotice that also the KB_selectAndAverageData is failing (trying to divide by zero). So, something is going on there and i can't catch it exactly. Maybe it is related to some \"Line meshes\" output in the HB_IndoorViewFactor.\n\n\n\nWill be glad if Chris can have a look or give his opinion on this.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1448881", "name": "typology_v053_simple_geom_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 28, 2016 at 4:21am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448851", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448880"}
