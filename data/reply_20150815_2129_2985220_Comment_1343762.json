{"body": "\nHello Chris,\n\nThank you for the reply!\n\nI am sorry for my mess model. I simplified it and hope you can help me to have a look. I built all the surfaces in Grasshopper one buy one instead of explode them from a box, I think this might be one suspect of this error. <br/>The issue I posted can be find without using any materials that I created, and I can not change the orientation bu entering numbers in \"runEnergysimulation\". That's why I built two zones.\n\nAbout the materials that I created myself, in my compute, it seems that the new materials can not be saved to the library for a long term, each time I open the file, I have to save the materials again and apply them again, then the file can work. But if I use your sample file from youtube, I don't need to do this. I don't know why.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nBest regards,\n\nYao\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1343764", "name": "11nobalconyaddlayer2zonesnew.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Yao Lv", "created_at": "August 15, 2015 at 09:29PM", "created_by": "YaoLv", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1343740", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1343762"}
