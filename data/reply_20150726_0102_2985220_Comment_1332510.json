{"body": "\nThank you very much, Abraham!\n\n\n\nI also got similar understanding reading the notation of the **EPWindowShade** component which is to generate shading control definition for a window, rather than creating shading geometry specifically.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe shadeBreps geometry output from this component can be used as HBContext object, but it will lose all the shading control definition and become pure obstruction geometry.\n\n\n\nSo, we either use the **EPWindowShade** component to define blinds for windows, or use the shading geometry created as HBContext geometry, but not both at the same time such as the the case in your GH file which will create **double shading** for a window.\n\n\n\nAm I correct?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "July 26, 2015 at 01:02AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1332319", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1332510"}
