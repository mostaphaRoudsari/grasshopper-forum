{"body": "\nHi Chris and Mostapha,\n\nCan I make a customized schedule for the HVAC system based on both the \"occupancy Schedules\" and the \"set points\"? It means the HVAC system will turn on only when two conditions are fulfilled simultaneously: 1)there is people in space; 2) the indoor temperature is lower the heating set point (or higher the cooling set point).\n\nIs that correct if I did it according to the attached image\u00a0(to achieve what I describe above) ?\n\n\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\nBest,\n\nDing[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/e94-*Sv1fqqi-1Ew5KnSfxTMukaRlAz5dwgSXeLGii1VyanIR45TdKLy-SCauuqtoK*41NkZLVlXrLHPmorm4QW2TeNZAprA/wxid_xu9hiy3srglp21_1446627865388_1.png\" width=\"593\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/e94-*Sv1fqqi-1Ew5KnSfxTMukaRlAz5dwgSXeLGii1VyanIR45TdKLy-SCauuqtoK*41NkZLVlXrLHPmorm4QW2TeNZAprA/wxid_xu9hiy3srglp21_1446627865388_1.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "November 04, 2015 at 02:08AM", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1356426", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1392241"}
