{"body": "\nAbraham pretty much said it all. \u00a0The only thing that I would add is that, when I export to illustrator, I usually only export only the lines of the graphic and the text that I am not going to edit there. \u00a0For the colored meshes, you can render them with Rhino render or, if you are cool with a lower-res solution, you can just take a screenshot of them (after setting the background to white). You can then put the images of the colored meshes behind your lines in the pdf.\n\nMy preferred method for quickly putting together a pdf is just taking a lot of screenshots/pictures with the windows snipping tool and pasting them into an illustrator file.\n\nI hope that helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 05, 2014 at 10:40AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1162388", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1162534"}
