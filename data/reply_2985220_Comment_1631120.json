{"body": "\nHi again,\n\nI am working with the example scripts sent above to produce a microclimate map and I have some questions:\n\n1- Is the effect of direct sun considered to calculate the surface temperature of the terrain and the surrounding buildings?\n\n2- It seems like the surface temperature of the terrain is only one for the whole top surface, that is, it does not differentiate between areas that are shaded and areas that are exposed to sun. Is this so? I guess that is is quite different being next to a ground that has been exposed to hours of sunlight or next to one that has been shaded, right?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nAlejandro\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "November 2, 2016 at 9:56am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1584047", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1631120"}
