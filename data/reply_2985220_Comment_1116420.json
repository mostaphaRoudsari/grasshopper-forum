{"body": "\nHi Reiner,\n\n\n\nIt sounds like the issue that yo mention is easy to address. \u00a0The glazing creator is setup, by default, to take a list of glazing ratios and apply them to walls based on their cardinal direction. \u00a0For example, plugging in a a list of 4 values will assign different glazing ratios based on N,S,E,W. \u00a08 values will assign different values based on N,NE,S,SE,S,SW,W,NW.\n\n\n\nTo use a list to get different ratios for the same wall, you can just graft this list of ratios in GH. \u00a0If you send me your GH file, I can show you exactly how to do this.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 13, 2014 at 7:26pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1116251", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1116420"}
