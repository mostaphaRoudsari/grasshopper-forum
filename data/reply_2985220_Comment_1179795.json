{"body": "\nHI Chris,\n\nSo I have error like this: too many values to unpack ?! And soo ,the strange thing is sometimes I have this error and than I just rerun the simulatin and it disapears but e.g. when i change the HOY (step of simulation) it appears again.\n\nAnd the file from Ale, runs for me with the connected analysis period also (but sometimes I have the same error as he had), and even I had one more error like the geometry is not closed...and it happens when I made the geometry from surfaces, but I know that it was closed. so maybe our OS or PC don\u00b4t want to cooperate with us :D :)\n\nregards\n\nPeter[<br/><img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4t8Bu5s6lgRwIwgCVCtTTJFNR7E3Ae-pfbA9hCgY6rtuGUYu6uyCEetwtLT0X7ZVz-3ukl03AC16h2*MlQVOdm49liz6W9SQ/error1.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4t8Bu5s6lgRwIwgCVCtTTJFNR7E3Ae-pfbA9hCgY6rtuGUYu6uyCEetwtLT0X7ZVz-3ukl03AC16h2*MlQVOdm49liz6W9SQ/error1.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Za\u0165ko", "created_at": "December 2, 2014 at 3:53pm", "created_by": "PeterZatko", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1179665", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1179795"}
