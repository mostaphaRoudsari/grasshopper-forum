{"body": "\nOk. I finally managed to get to this discussion. :) That's my mistake. Burin is right and I added the threshold to set illuminance setpoints for daylight controls assuming I will implement it before the release but I never get the chance to do it ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/118](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/118))\n\n\n\nOverwriting the value for LPD was a bug. For now I removed the input form the component ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/ad8e31b342058fb...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/ad8e31b342058fbf09ea064619ce23ad2021677f)) and I will add it back once we have daylight control object.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 11, 2015 at 4:01pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240887", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1261152"}
