{"body": "\nFirst off: huge thanks to the excellent development team of HB and LB! These are really amazing tools!\n\nI am developing workflows for running schematic energy analysis on urban development massing studies. Specifically, I am looking at variations on a perimeter block that has small towers on top of it (image below). I create zones with 'Honeybee_SplitBuildingMass' and add glazing with 'Honeybee_Glazing based on ratio'. In the model below there are 116 zones.\n\nHere are some observations/questions:\n\n1. I am able to create these zones on one pass but Rhino/Grasshopper crashes immediately if I try to create windows on one pass. If, however, I separate the base from the towers before adding glazing, things work out fine. (Note: It has to be done in this specific way - splitting the zone list in some random way does not help). \u00a0It would obviously be nice if it were possible to avoid the extra step of separating the zones (towers from podium) before window creation. I would like to be able to automatically generate zones for more complex geometries (still just boxes though).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/nqHVUVOkmeNfT5ibVWNObFvlaBBnQnuyw6knDk2GKiBy25611oNVHphe6TGZlvVsyPg46mKLBoEZY*gLXKNcLKs6kuVH9isg/block.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nqHVUVOkmeNfT5ibVWNObFvlaBBnQnuyw6knDk2GKiBy25611oNVHphe6TGZlvVsyPg46mKLBoEZY*gLXKNcLKs6kuVH9isg/block.jpg)\n\n2. While testing different options for generating windows with 'Honeybee_Glazing based on ratio', I noticed that the component is really fast if I use it before applying 'Honeybee_Solve Adjacencies'. I would guess about a thousand times faster. Why might this be? The downside is that I get windows on all the interior walls...\n\nAny thoughts on how I could streamline these workflows? Any thoughts on further development of these components from the development team?\n\n3. Finally, a wish: it would be really great to have a fully fleshed out 'Dump Honeybee Objects' component. With large models there is a good chance that GH freezes or crashes and it would help a lot if I could save HB zones along the way.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ernst Bay", "created_at": "April 5, 2016 at 9:46pm", "created_by": "ErnstBay", "topic": "Massing studies with Honeybee - Speed of Zone and Window Creation", "id": "topic_1501600"}
