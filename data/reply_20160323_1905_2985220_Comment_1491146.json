{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI'm still not able to add glazing to a surface in Honeybee. The problem is obviously with the way that I am drawing the windows in Rhino. To draw a window I draw a new surface around the edge of the Wall I am trying to add the window onto and then change the size of it to match the required window size. However I don't seem to be able to get my windows on the same plane as the surface/zone doing this. Can you please tell me step by step what method you use to draw the window in Rhino to get the Brep to put into Honeybee?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chelle Payne", "created_at": "March 23, 2016 at 07:05PM", "created_by": "ChellePayne", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489801", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1491146"}
