{"body": "\nAlso, Julia, I forgot to answer your question. \u00a0The Export to OpenStudio component is not not doing any heavy-lifting in writing an IDF. \u00a0Rather, it is writing an .osm file for OpenStudio using OpenStudio's API (this makes it MUCH easier to add detailed HVAC Systems to the model). \u00a0The component then uses the OpenStudio API to covert the .osm to an .idf that can be run through EnergyPlus. \u00a0This is a very different way of working than using the \"Import IDF\" functionality that you mentioned as this would probably reult in a lot of information loss, as you say.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 23, 2016 at 7:03am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1586247", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1586699"}
