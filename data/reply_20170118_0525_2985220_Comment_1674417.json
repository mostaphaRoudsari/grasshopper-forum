{"body": "\nHi Camila,\n\n\n\nThe problem is that the simulation of 10-10 was not taking the period properly. I think it got confused as a period from 10 to 10 is not exactly a period but an instant.\n\nIf you change it to an HOY it works\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/llVO6PYtbd6s9-BqBDjSnuSDPZVOlLGLF21Db1tKrOp9AUxAIt4q7ZYHVg8Xu2TBedCOr5Yky40q8vAmuLB6t6V6t3b*HWvz/HOY.PNG\" width=\"680\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/llVO6PYtbd6s9-BqBDjSnuSDPZVOlLGLF21Db1tKrOp9AUxAIt4q7ZYHVg8Xu2TBedCOr5Yky40q8vAmuLB6t6V6t3b*HWvz/HOY.PNG)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/llVO6PYtbd7Llf0J1vzAUgfsv28URPYzHW4axbH5TamvLG2GEKxoAUhuNg*2kd0YXlE-HJaFquCyUoTu8c95-0YcfLZ7HX5X/HOYdifference.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/llVO6PYtbd7Llf0J1vzAUgfsv28URPYzHW4axbH5TamvLG2GEKxoAUhuNg*2kd0YXlE-HJaFquCyUoTu8c95-0YcfLZ7HX5X/HOYdifference.PNG)\n\n\n\nYour results wont be the same as mine, as I didn't have an epw from Sao Paulo, so I used one from London\n\n\u00a0You will find the things I added grouped. Hope it helps.\n\n\n\nJulia\n\n\n\nEdit: I guess if you keep it as you had it before my change but you put in the period from 9 to 10 it will work.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1674419", "name": "RadiationAnalysis_ResultProblems_HOY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Julia T", "created_at": "January 18, 2017 at 05:25AM", "created_by": "JuliaT", "parent_id": "topic_1673791", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1674417"}
