{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nFirst of all sorry if there was a thread I could add this, couldn't find one.\n\n\n\nI was wondering about something that I unfortunately don't have the time to test.\n\n\n\nIf I undertand correctly the simpler methods that E+ employs for solar distrubtion assign radiation equally to all indoor surfaces, something that I guess would impact some of the metrics calculated by E+.\n\n\n\nMy questions is should I make it a habit to create convex zones and use the fullInteriorAndExterior mode for accurate results or is it that the impact on results isn't all that great to justify that?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 3, 2016 at 9:20pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Thermal Comfort and Solar Distribution", "id": "topic_1430127"}
