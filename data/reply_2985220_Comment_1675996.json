{"body": "\nHi again,\n\nThe previous issue appeared again and now i can't make it dissapear (messed legend). I can't say what i did to make it happen, so i don't know where to point a finger. Just can say that it started when the ThermBoundary component was updated.\n\nAfter the previous paragraph, I copied from another file a previous version of the component and the legend was fixed. Switched back to the updated version and it is working now.\n\nWeird, but there is an issue here. FYI.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 21, 2017 at 12:01pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1674245", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1675996"}
