{"body": "\nMasoumehta,\n\nYour errors were due mostly to your materials, which had properties like 0.01 reflectance. \u00a0Properties like this do not occur in nature unless we are talking about a black hole or something that theoretically approaches a black body. \u00a0Once you boost up this reflectance to reasonable values (like 0.25) or take default materials, you start getting simulations that make sense (see attached file).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DYswKX9FwiR*SezfD8acs6zq**M5bsaCSzsRK*gfNRd5OaHhnj6vk*T9ggDAvjohQIkhMqZtVFhOqQ-ncfZNTkhUyf25bHUI/UDIThatMakesSense.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DYswKX9FwiR*SezfD8acs6zq**M5bsaCSzsRK*gfNRd5OaHhnj6vk*T9ggDAvjohQIkhMqZtVFhOqQ-ncfZNTkhUyf25bHUI/UDIThatMakesSense.JPG)\n\nMostapha, should we put in a warning if a user inputs a reflectance below 0.1? \u00a0It seems to not only be incorrect from a physical properties standpoint but it also seems to make DAYSIM go crazy and completely discount the dark surface from the simulation (causing some big disagreements between illuminance studies from Radiance and an annual simulation with DAYSIM with the same HBObjects).\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1429621", "name": "001_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 2, 2016 at 6:31pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1429072", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1429619"}
