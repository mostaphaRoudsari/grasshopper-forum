{"body": "\nHi Ladybug+Honeybee team,\n\nFirstly I would like to thank to everybody in this community for all the passion and time you put in this group. I've learned many things from your discussion, your example files.\n\nI have done a lot of things with Ladybug and Butterfly tool in my project for daylighting and wind simulation.\n\nNow I'm starting with Honeybee tool to run energy simulation. And I stuck at the first step. I went through all topic that I found in this group to solve my issue. Unfortunally, I still don't understand how can I define the zone in my project.\n\nI made a simple model to explain my \u00a0issue as you can see in the attached file.\n\nGreyzone: Big living room with lots of windows around.\n\nBlue zone: Storage room which is a half underground.\n\nGreen zone: Kitchen which is inside and same level floor with\u00a0the greyzone,\u00a0\n\nRed zone: Bedroom which is a half outside and a half inside. It has the glass windows to look out side and inside\n\nPink zone: Working room (half inside and half outside). It's directly connected with the inside space and glass window outside\n\nYellow zone: Skyline.\n\nThey are connected to each other by stair case.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0As I see in many example file, Zones are at the same floor and they are not intersect each other. My situation is opposite.\n\nCould you help me clarify how can I define the zone in this situation to have the correct energy model?\n\n\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nlam,\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1813272", "name": "Houseinhouse.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1813273", "name": "Houseinhouse.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "lamvd", "created_at": "September 14, 2017 at 11:50PM", "created_by": "lamvd", "topic": "Complex zone in Honeybee", "id": "topic_1813274"}
