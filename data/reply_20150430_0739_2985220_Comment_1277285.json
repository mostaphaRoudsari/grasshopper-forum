{"body": "\nHi Mikael, thanks again for your suggestion. <br/><br/>To follow up a little bit; Do you know why Honeybee does not recognize .epw files with IWEC2 formatting? Studying .epw files with IWEC and IWEC2 formatting side by side, I can't see that there are any imidiate differences in the structure of the file. (Perhaps this is a question for Mostapha?) It seems strange that HB only recognizes IWEC since IWEC2 is the official version sold by ASHRAE.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "\u00d6rn Erlendsson", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 07:39AM", "created_by": "OErnErlendsson", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262928", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1277285"}
