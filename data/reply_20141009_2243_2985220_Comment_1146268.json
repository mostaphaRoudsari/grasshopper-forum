{"body": "\nI'm actually having the same problem. On my home computer it works as it should, but at work the GenCumulativeSkyMtx component doesn't seem to do what it is supposed to. The *.mtx files it generates are 0kb. I've tried regenning the files several times, and changed the workingDir_ as well, but it still makes empty files. I assume it is something to do with how my work computer is set up, but I cannot make sense of how to fix it.\n\n\n\nAny ideas?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Shane Simon", "created_at": "October 09, 2014 at 10:43PM", "created_by": "ShaneSimon", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1043197", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1146268"}
