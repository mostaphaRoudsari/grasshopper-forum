{"body": "\nHi Alejandro and Chris,\n\n\n\nAny updates on this? On my side I am facing a similar problem.\n\nI have been analyzing Outdoor comfort on a rather big area surrounded by retail and commercial buildings (I have around 12000 test points). I am working with Butterfly to calculate the wind speed and EnergyPlus for the Outdoor Temperatures of the surfaces.\n\n\n\nI am working with the workflow developed by Chris here:<br/><br/>[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Outdoor_Microclimate_Map&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=6.964404506368996&amp;offset=-5003.050603651463,-950.7324557501929)\n\n\n\nand adding the CFD results.\n\n\n\nAfter computing a single CFD simulation, I am now trying to input the list of values with the wind speed results(12000 wind speed values for the same 12000 test points) to the _windspeed input of the UTCI Comfort Recipe component. However, the component expects an annual list of data per point (12.000 branches, each of them with 8760 values). As you can imagine, such a vast list of data crashes Rhino and Grasshopper.\n\n\n\nIs there any workaround this, to make the component accept only 1 value per point? My idea is to use the result from the CFD simulation for whatever the analysis period is required later in the Microclimate analysis component.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\n\nRafael\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rafael A.", "created_at": "March 13, 2017 at 1:04pm", "created_by": "RafaelA", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1654867", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1711159"}
