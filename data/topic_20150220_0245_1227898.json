{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI was running a model with HB and E+ and everything was fine. I decided to move the Rhino model into a new file, rebuild and refine my GH on it and add some additional details of material and programs. Now I try to run the E+ calculation and is not runnign giving me different geometry problems every time. I open my previous GH definition with the sam RHino file and runs just fine! I am really puzzled (and sleepless) since I want to run the newer version.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn the mean time the construction EP material components seem to have some issues. I can create and save a new material but the latest version of E+ simulation doesn't seem able to find them and turn orange. After I change to existing EP material the problems with the new simulation begin!\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny ideas?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 20, 2015 at 02:45AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "topic": "WIERD ENERGY+ SIMULATION PROBLEM!", "id": "topic_1227898"}
