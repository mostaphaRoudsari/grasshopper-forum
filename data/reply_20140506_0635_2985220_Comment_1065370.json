{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Giuseppe,\n\nLooks like your account doesn't have writing permissions to C: drive.\n\n\n\nThis is strange as I already check the user permissions inside the component and try to introduce a new path but for some reason it doesn't work on your system.\n\n\n\nWe have to fix this step by step. We had a similar discussion with\u00a0[Wim](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/how-to-get-radiance-and-daysim-installed?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1025188&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\u00a0before and he solved it by creating a folder for Ladybug that he had writing permission. Is it also a possibility for you?\n\n\n\nI put a component together that prints your permissions. Do you want to give it a try and let me know the results? On your system it will probably return False for write, and execute. Let me know the results and we will figure out how to get it solved.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UZ8UQ2FXhhM*GSgu76zII5aDI1XHFZunTbirM3kwf5wjSHPiQsmdREN5u6UlqygLh7Sh-iZdQ7QiLwhbs1CbAtQ*cgks8ozP/testAccess.png\" width=\"483\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UZ8UQ2FXhhM*GSgu76zII5aDI1XHFZunTbirM3kwf5wjSHPiQsmdREN5u6UlqygLh7Sh-iZdQ7QiLwhbs1CbAtQ*cgks8ozP/testAccess.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1065371", "name": "testAccess.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 06, 2014 at 06:35AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1065105", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1065370"}
