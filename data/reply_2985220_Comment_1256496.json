{"body": "\nHi Rafat,\n\nThe error is because you assigned a window constructions to walls and roof. You need to create the glazing surfaces inside the wall/roof (parent surfaces) and assign the window construction to them. You can also simplify your geometry which will save you so much time. There were couple of other mistakes such as assigning adiabatic boundary condition to walls and roofs.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1256497", "name": "Greenhousever01_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 4, 2015 at 6:28pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1251611", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256496"}
