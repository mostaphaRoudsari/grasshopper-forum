{"body": "\nHi,\n\nWanted to report that this will be difficult to debug.\n\nI tried a simpler example: Defining zones by volume and defining zones by surface. For both of them the results match exactly. This is GOOD.\n\nThe example that is making trouble works surface by surface. The difference between this and the previous is that this one have AIRWALLS and the previous doesn't.\n\nI suppose this is the reason why the ZoneMixing is created. The new test files don't have this Block of information in the IDF file.\n\nAs a result of the above my instinct says that the AIRWALLS conditions should be checked in the code to see what is the difference when creating IDFs either with E+ or OS components.\n\nTo remind from previous posts:\n\nThe model has 7 windows for all zones (7 zones. 1 zone has 2 windows and one zone has no windows). For the ZONEMIXINGblock the E+ IDF duplicate the number of objects (14) in relation to the OS (7).\n\nYou can see in this image how the ZoneMixing objects are connected (Bold end of line is the Source Zone Name field; the plain end of line is the Zone Name). You can see that the E+ is connecting for both ends and the OS only one end. Something to think, to check or to be worried about?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/EVCxEhQ6bj3Jp5VwQUali58nlLJNR3G2OJ73CoyScPrFWqXEiUp9mkyPlRYXT-nOAGGajD6HLRbTE1I6uiGwwJg7bddSuw0l/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/EVCxEhQ6bj3Jp5VwQUali58nlLJNR3G2OJ73CoyScPrFWqXEiUp9mkyPlRYXT-nOAGGajD6HLRbTE1I6uiGwwJg7bddSuw0l/Capture.JPG)\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 19, 2016 at 04:45AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619758", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1621277"}
