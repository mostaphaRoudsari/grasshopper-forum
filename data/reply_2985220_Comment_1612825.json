{"body": "\nHello Antonello and Djordje,\u00a0<br/><br/>First thank you very much for your two super useful components!\u00a0<br/><br/>I used to have the same workflow as Djordje's component using opentopography data but written with \"ugly\" \"basic\" Grasshopper and PythonGh script. So I am super happy to have this new TerrainGenerator2 component added to Ladybug suite ! :)<br/><br/>However, following the install instructions and checking for the opentopography.org availability, the component does not seem to manage to download the data... (see picture attached).<br/>Djordje, do you have any idea about what I can I do or check to fix this?\u00a0<br/><br/>Other question, just to be sure, regarding the \"origin_\", is it the central point that you to get out of the output mesh/surface? And does it need to be the point at the actual point elevation or does it need to be the point projected on the ground floor (as I do in my definition)?\u00a0<br/><br/>Thanks again for your work,\u00a0<br/><br/>Cheers\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1612827", "name": "Screenshot 2016-10-07 11.53.57.png"}], "created_by_name": "Aymeric Delmas", "created_at": "October 7, 2016 at 2:44am", "created_by": "AymericDelmas", "parent_id": "topic_1583923", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1612825"}
