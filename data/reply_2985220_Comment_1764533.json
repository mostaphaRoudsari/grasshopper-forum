{"body": "\nThis way of doing lighting calculations is far too esoteric for it be of any use as a\u00a0 permanent script in Honeybee.\n\nThere is a [paper](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1477153515593579) in lighting research and technology which discusses a Radiance-based workflow for an improvement over this method. All the ingredients required for performing that simulation are already present in Honeybee. By the way, if you'd like to undestand more about this I'd suggest the writings of Chris Cuttle. He has been discussing this concept for more than a decade.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "June 6, 2017 at 3:51am", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1764108", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1764533"}
