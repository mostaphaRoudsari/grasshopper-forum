{"body": "\nI guess we can extract the data required for the reports using the RDD component. Next week I am hoping to re-focus on energy simulations and I will try and do that using the current standard LEED report from other software as a guide. I could then possibly reproduce this by using the same list of simulation outputs each time.\n\n\n\nOf course, between numerical data outputs and a report there is some distance. That's where an OS measure would come in handy. I guess, after following Chris's amazing webinars I know how easy\u00a0 it is to just open the HB model in Openstudio and run the measure. I can do that for now with no problem, but I'm partial to LB/HB so it would be cool to have it as a feature.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "October 16, 2016 at 3:00am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1619419", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619102"}
