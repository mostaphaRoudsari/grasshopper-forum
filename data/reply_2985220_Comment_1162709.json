{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThat makes sense for the direct component. But I can't figure out why\u00a0we see bands on the diffuse component or why the top of the skydome is nearly zero. Any thoughts?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIs there any way within genCumSky\u00a0to generate a Reinhart skydome using 1/2 hour or 15 minute increments? It seems that the Reinhart skydome offers false accuracy by adding higher resolution without interpolating hourly data. I\u00a0would think\u00a0Reinhart figured out a\u00a0way around this but I don't understand the radiance commands. Do you know a way to do this?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks for your help.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "November 5, 2014 at 5:59pm", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1162772", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1162709"}
