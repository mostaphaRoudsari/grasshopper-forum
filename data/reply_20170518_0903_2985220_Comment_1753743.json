{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nI realize this is an old thread, but this is exactly the problem I am currently working on, and I came across this file and have run into some issues. I've been testing this out and it works well on certain days, but others it seems to return no data. I've attached an image of December and March 21. December works correctly, but March is returning all 0s for cumulative radiation out of the honeybee daylight analysis.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1753745", "name": "December.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1753746", "name": "March.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Dennis Goff", "created_at": "May 18, 2017 at 09:03AM", "created_by": "DennisGoff567", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1366018", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1753743"}
