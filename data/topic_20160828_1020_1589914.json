{"body": "\nDear bees and bugs, in the GH file attached the **monthly electricity demand** is not the same across different months although the zone loads and schedules are fixed (this can be seemed by the hourly electricity demand chart which is consistent across each day).\n\n\n\nMay I ask what might be causing this ?\n\n\n\nThis cause the problem that the **net purchased electricity** is not the difference between the **total electricity demand** and the **total electricity generated**. E.g. using Chicago's epw file, the electricity generated is 4717kWh, electricity demand is 4504kWh, and net purchased energy is 258kWh.\n\n\n\nAppreciate if you can point out any import things I miss here.\n\n\n\nThank you very much!\n\n- Ji\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/f6a-QIwO2RZLUIVFeuZR0EQ*1Mjxup6FWWVN-cAhTCoDZBxZy8XIhZxZ7j8vBpufRlZGjjpMqLQ3ny0g*x*B*bbbpQ3tEBAE/Picture1.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/f6a-QIwO2RZLUIVFeuZR0EQ*1Mjxup6FWWVN-cAhTCoDZBxZy8XIhZxZ7j8vBpufRlZGjjpMqLQ3ny0g*x*B*bbbpQ3tEBAE/Picture1.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1589913", "name": "pv generator issue.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 28, 2016 at 10:20AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "monthly electricity demand is not the same although zone loads and the schedules are fixed", "id": "topic_1589914"}
