{"body": "\nHey there! I am looking for a plugin of Grasshopper that is able to make a simulation of the temperature on the external walls, roofs and streets of my 3D model of a group of 16 buildings. In other words I need a tool that would take as input an epw file and the 3D model (surfaces and materials) and that would give as output the temperature distribution on the 3D model in Rhino.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat I managed to do till now is the radiation map with the Diva plug-in of Grasshopper (see the attachment), which is lovely but what I need is something exactly as colourful as that but in a temperature scale (possibly Celsius \u00b0C).\n\n\n\nDoes anybody know if that would be possible in Ladybug or Honeybee?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1651523", "name": "Screenshot 2016-11-17 14.12.03.png"}], "created_by_name": "Valerio Soldera", "created_at": "December 4, 2016 at 3:55am", "created_by": "ValerioSoldera", "topic": "Temperature of surfaces", "id": "topic_1651524"}
