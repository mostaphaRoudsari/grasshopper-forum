{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris,\n\n\n\nI totally skipped this discussion after trying for a couple of days to make DE work and then had to skip projects. I am really sorry and thank you for your replies in any case. I encounter the same problem again. I am attaching a line of my CSV here:\u00a0\n\n\n\nname:Distribution,in:Orientation,in:NumberOfStripes,in:NumberOPlanes,out:Planarity,out:Deviation,img:img<br/>Normalised,0,10,15,0.484915,1.220677,[https://www.dropbox.com/s/pb35wnns1o38jx4/Hallo_Perspective.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pb35wnns1o38jx4/Hallo_Perspective.png?dl=0)\n\n\n\nEven if I try the input and output data without the prefixes (name:. in:, out: img: etc) I still see no result. Only in case I replace my link with one of the links you have in your example files the DE seems to respond! Any input would be great!\u00a0\n\n\n\n-Tasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 2:56am", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1420786", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448220"}
