{"body": "\nHi Aaron,\n\nYou can use custom materials. What Abraham mentioned above is in EnergyPlus you need to create a construction using the material and then apply it to your window. You cannot apply the material directly.\n\nWhat parameters of Glass do you want to play with which is not available here? You can manipulate all the 3 parameters that you mentioned above. I didn't include an interface for full glazing definition as I wasn't sure if anyone would ever use it but you can just create it as a string and change the properties with sliders.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 21, 2014 at 9:31pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1153446", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1153553"}
