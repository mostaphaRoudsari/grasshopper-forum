{"body": "\nHey Mostapha,\n\nI was updating .ghusers in the office and noticed that pasting them on top didn't overwrite all the files, this reminded me of the same problem when I used update\u00a0ladybug component. There are like three or four .ghuser files left after the cleanup.\n\nI would like to know are these ok to remove, because you made new components that integrated them or these are more like completely done and nothing to add so they don't get updates???\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "October 27, 2015 at 07:44PM", "created_by": "Timur582", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1387167", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1388041"}
