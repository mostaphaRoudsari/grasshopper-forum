{"body": "\nDear everyone,\n\n\n\nFirst of all, thanks to Mostapha for BF development, an incredible tool!\n\n\n\n**The 1st ques**: pls check\u00a0the\u00a01st attached .png image. Basically, I am bit of confused by the 'inletBoundary' and 'outletBoundary' components in which the 'temperatures_' represents?\n\n\n\n**The 2nd ques**\u00a0is more about thinking how to achieve more potentials by BF. I am doing a project that is trying to implement the construction method of 'DOUBLE-GLAZED' facade, which will conduct air flow inside a building and save more energy. Since I also use LB&amp;HB for time-based analyses, so I`m wondering if BF could use time-based-srf-temperature to achieve a more dynamic simulation in a day, let`s say, a hot summer day, 10:00 to 16:00?\n\n\n\nAnd the last what is the definition of these recipes(pic no.2)? what do they mean?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for the helps!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nLei\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1757485", "name": "question 01.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1757486", "name": "question 02.png"}], "created_by_name": "Lei  Yang", "created_at": "May 25, 2017 at 2:39am", "created_by": "LeiYang", "topic": "Butterfly time-based simulation QUESTIONS", "id": "topic_1757487"}
