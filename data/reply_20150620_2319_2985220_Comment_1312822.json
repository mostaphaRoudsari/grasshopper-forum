{"body": "\nHi Yasin,\n\nSorry for the delay checking this. The truth is that it took me a while becouse what you said: it is a bit messy :-)\n\nSee attached with a lot of updates, most of them manually since there were plenty of components updated lately that changed the number of input/output items. I marked them with black arrows so you can notice.\n\nAnother thing is that some of your constructions/materials had space and number in the name (for instance MetalDecking 130mm). HB doesn't like the number after the space, so i added a \"_\".\n\nBut most important: i didn't check if the file works. Sorry. I tried but it takes a lot of time, so i stopped it. You need to check this at your end, an hopefully it will work fine.\n\nLet know.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1312823", "name": "02postlsimulationKAITsimulationBUp_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 20, 2015 at 11:19PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1309435", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1312822"}
