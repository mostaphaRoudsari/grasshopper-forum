{"body": "\nHey Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks it seems to work now!\n\n\n\nHowever, the parallel command is still giving the error, it runs okay without parallel toggled on. I am not sure if it is my system or definition, or the component, but parallel seems useful in this demanding calculation.\n\nAnother odd thing. I'm playing with the layers of the wall construction and when I changed layer the vertical surface in the operative temperature disappeared. When I reverted, it was back. I think this mostly related to me though.\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 9, 2015 at 12:39am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1220949", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1221122"}
