{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\n\n\nI thank you for sharing your thoughts here and sparking this great discussion. So far, I have only tried optimization experiments such as finding a good balance between daylight and energy use. I have been reading about ML too, and I have one question for you.\n\n\n\nIn ML, the training set is typically used to derive the function that establishes the connection between the inputs and outputs. Now you said that after you design your model, you disable everything and then only run your sliders. From that, I infer that you have successfully caught a function. I like that idea very much. I am really curious to know how you catch that in GH?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "December 15, 2016 at 9:30am", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1648592", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1658629"}
