{"body": "\nDear Mostapha,\n\nthank you for your reply.\n\nI saw the discussion you highlighted but my problem is different. It seems the model does not take into account the presence of the window, as the values are equal to 0.018 during the day.\n\n\n\nProbably I should rebuilt the model, but the strange thing is that before the honeybee latest update everything worked correctly.\n\n\n\nIt would be great if you could try to run my definition, just to see what is changed.\n\n\n\nIn any case, thank you\n\nMarco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marco P", "created_at": "February 25, 2016 at 8:53am", "created_by": "MarcoP", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1470952", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1471300"}
