{"body": "\nHi Guillaume,\n\nThanks for reporting. Are you sure that first download was successful? The file that Ladybug downloads is the same file as what you get in Radiance. Just to make sure I updated the file again. I also added a new check to the component so in case Radiance is already installed it copies the file from Radiance folder instead of downloading it.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 22, 2014 at 6:15pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1154142", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1154072"}
