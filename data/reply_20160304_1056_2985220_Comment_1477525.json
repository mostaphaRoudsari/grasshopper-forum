{"body": "\nHi Mostapha\n\n<br/>I'm sorry, I didn't know your script about Epw files.<br/>I thought and made this component yesterday night. I had this idea because of a problem that I had years ago about Epw files, writing manually some values of ENVI-Met inside it.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I'm agree with you about the problem of too many components. if you want I can send you this component like it appears now, thus you can see if there are some good ideas to complete your code. My Python is still too young ;) And if you need too much time to complete your code you could write a temporary component.\n\n\n\nIt works very well, I was thinking to add some others functions to read automatically the type of variable, and warnings, too. And it can edit all variables of Epw file.\n\n\n\nThe principle was to create a waterfall of these components, one for each variable edited. As you can see from this image.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/18H-groRyDSV9r0JfOVvQmmPjOql1iicKQp9yTntVCEzaNrX0jEGpIDCvkxPCqDDRBcjnHF2HzeyIwIorYUn9F1dkShYbD5W/WATERFALLMETHOD.png?width=600\" width=\"600\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/18H-groRyDSV9r0JfOVvQmmPjOql1iicKQp9yTntVCEzaNrX0jEGpIDCvkxPCqDDRBcjnHF2HzeyIwIorYUn9F1dkShYbD5W/WATERFALLMETHOD.png)\n\nIn this way you can track the editing.\n\nLet's talk about other ideas about this issue by email, ok? Thanks!\n\n\n\nBest\n\nAntonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "March 04, 2016 at 10:56AM", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1477370", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1477525"}
