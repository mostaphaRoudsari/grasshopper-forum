{"body": "\nMy two cents here...\n\n\n\nsDA calculation and 2% rule are dictated by IES LM-83-12 and LEED v4 adopts sDA metric. Unlike DA or other annual metrics,\u00a0blind\u00a0operation should be embedded in sDA calculation. The aim is to prevent\u00a0overestimating the amount of usable light\u00a0or underestimating lighting energy consumption (Daylighting performance will be penalized when users will lower\u00a0blind to\u00a0prevent\u00a0potential glare issue at certain period of time).\n\n\n\nMore details could be found at [sDA and blinds operation](https://blog.lightstanza.com/2016/02/05/sda-4-step-1-blinds-operations/)\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have\u00a0the same question whether HB can support sDA\u00a0calculation. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Cheney", "created_at": "April 30, 2016 at 01:00PM", "created_by": "Cheney", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519246", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519497"}
