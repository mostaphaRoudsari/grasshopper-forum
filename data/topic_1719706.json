{"body": "\nHi there!\n\nI'm pretty excited about the Butterfly beta release... as always, thanks a lot to all contributors for the amazing work!\n\n\n\nNow I've got a question: Is it possible to use it with a regular, non-docker installation of OpenFOAM?\n\nI have, for example a Linux machine with different OF versions plus Virtualbox with a Windows 10 Guest system on it. Is it somehow possible to let Butterfly use the OF installation of the host system? (Installing OF for Windows is not possible with Virtualbox)\n\nOr can I even set up a case on my Windows Laptop and use the seperate Linux machine (or maybe even an Amazon EC2 instance) to run the OF calculations?\n\nIf not, is it planned?\n\nCheers\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Albert Pressler", "created_at": "March 24, 2017 at 5:49am", "created_by": "AlbertPressler", "topic": "Using Butterfly with regular OF in VM", "id": "topic_1719706"}
