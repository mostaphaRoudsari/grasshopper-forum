{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, thank you for your help, the honeybee has been installed correctly. However, there are some new problems when I run the energy simulation component. First, when I run the honeybee energy simulation component, some geometry components of the model are lost as shown in figure 1. Besides, the read EP result is lack of total energy, cooling, heating data, as shown in figure 2. The output of the simulation process is shown as figure attachment text. Thank you for your help.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1178052", "name": "figure 1.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1178053", "name": "simulation record.txt"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1178054", "name": "2.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Han Yunsong", "created_at": "November 30, 2014 at 2:15am", "created_by": "HanYunsong", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1177034", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1178051"}
