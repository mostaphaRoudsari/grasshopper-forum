{"body": "\nHi Bi,\n\nIt's not a late reply, it took you one day to reply.<br/>Unless you plan to post your next reply in 2017, everything is ok :)<br/><br/>\n\nI have searched for some issues as same as mine. And I tend to do the similar thing as Amaraa's ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/finding-an-](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/finding-an-)...), to explore an optimal pv array with the most AC energy production.\n\nHave in mind, that [Amaraa's topic](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/finding-an-optimal-size-of-pv-panel-in-given-array)\u00a0dealt with PV system integrated into a facade. And as far as I understood you would like to put your PV modules on a roof. So it may be that some of my replies from that topic, may not apply to your roof PV system.\n\n<br/>Also, Amaraa's topic did not deal with optimal PV system size (DC rating in kW). You would like to calculate that one as well?\n\n\n\nI plan to set three parameters (orientation, tilt angle and distance of pv), and use Galapagos to make a best horizontal pv grid of most AC energy. So the most important is to avoid the dark core-shadows from shelf shading. If so, I wonder whether the gh document you uploaded in the discussion named \"Finding an optimal size of PV panel in given array\" will be helpful to me. And should I use the Sun Path component to calculate the self shading?\n\nOk, so you decided to go with the upper 2)a) solution?\n\nDid I understand that correctly?<br/><br/>Btw. sorry if you receive three emails for this reply. For some reason I had to delete it, and post it again. Grasshopper forum is working strange in the last couple of weeks.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "November 2, 2016 at 1:27pm", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1631053", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1631337"}
