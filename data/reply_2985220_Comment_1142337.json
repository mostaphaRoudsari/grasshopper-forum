{"body": "\nHi Nate,\n\nThose are some very high lux levels that you are getting there and I see that you are simulating an almost fully-glazed building. \u00a0I haven't gotten the chance to run your Daysim analysis yet but, if I had to guess, it looks like the simulations differ from each other by an hour. \u00a0On one hour, you have the sun shining directly through most of the glass making that big orange mark across your building (this would be the annual analysis on the right). \u00a0On the other, you have the sun moved one hour later and is directly shining only on a little corner of your building (this would be the grid-based analysis). \u00a0It seems like you may have discovered a bug in the matching of hours between the two analyses types. \u00a0Let me know if I am mistaken and, Mostapha, let me know if you think that this is true.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 3, 2014 at 7:55pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1142432", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1142337"}
