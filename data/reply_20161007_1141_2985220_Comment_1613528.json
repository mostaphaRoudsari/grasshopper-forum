{"body": "\nThanks Djordje,\u00a0<br/><br/>It actually works with my laptop (don't know why or what is the difference).\u00a0<br/>Anyway. Actually, I already have the .tif file for the whole Island that I used to generate a mesh with the DTM component (actually used it in .asc format). I use it to place various points based on their locations on it.\u00a0\n\n<br/>What I would like to do, that I have not managed so far and that your component could help me to do, is to generate a Surface patch based on a radius_ and the _location of a specific place of the Island ( as your component do! ;)<br/><br/>At the end, it is basically using your component as a split component of the whole island .tif, instead of downloading each time the data.<br/><br/>Does this makes sense to you?\n\nI have started to look at your script I can see the parts that I am interested in but my hard coding skills are quiet poor ^^<br/><br/>\n\nTif file and metadata :[https://we.tl/y0lg3usqb9](https://we.tl/y0lg3usqb9)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aymeric Delmas", "created_at": "October 07, 2016 at 11:41AM", "created_by": "AymericDelmas", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1612784", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1613528"}
