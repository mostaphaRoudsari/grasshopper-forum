{"body": "\nHi Elly,\n\n\n\nYes it was hard for me to get it running as well. The trick was to bring all the values (even the name of the variables in data recorders) and to use text split to update the values used at each iteration.\n\n\n\nI'm currently running a simulation so I cannot clean up my file but you should be able to discern how it works. Special attention to the pollination part (bottom right) and also the text split component (which is crucial in making slider values into iterative parameters) right by the slider section on the left.\n\n\n\nFor anyone interested, what it does is calculate the vertical sky cover of an urban canyon by rotating it around the y axis (what I call massing orientation) and also rotating each of the buildings individually (left or right building rotation). The massing rotation interval is 15 degrees and the building interval is 5 degrees, with a maximum of 40. This gives 1944 possible configurations which are further reduced by assigning a minimum distance between the two buildings of 6m. The check of that distance is a boolean (true or false) and acts as the toggle that starts the simulation. Finally, the simulation is of vertical sky cover which is the fastest one for testing and fits my needs.\n\n\n\nP.S.: I realize calculating VSC of this configuration for all 360 degrees doesn't make much sense but it's the ability of the definition to test this atm that matters and not the results.\n\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1447781", "name": "TG_UrbanCanyon.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 07:46PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447700", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447780"}
