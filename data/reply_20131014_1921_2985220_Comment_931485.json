{"body": "\nHi Ben,\n\nCheck the normal direction of the test surfaces. I assume they are downward in your model.\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: I'm still not ready to release the new version officially but as I assume you may have so many test points for your study feel free to download the newer version from this link and replace it with what you already have: ([https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16228160/Ladybug_0.0.46_WIP.zip](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdl.dropboxusercontent.com%2Fu%2F16228160%2FLadybug_0.0.46_WIP.zip&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEn2P8q1AA598dV8Y-Nfe0G5KWRQg)). Set the parallel to True and if you are running the study on a system with multiple cores the study will run times faster.\n\nPS1: Anybody else who is willing to try the new version is also welcome to do so. Just download it from the same link. I will release the new version 0.0.49 pretty soon. There are minor modifications to be made before the release.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 14, 2013 at 07:21PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_931647", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_931485"}
