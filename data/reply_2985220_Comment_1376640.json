{"body": "\nThank you Abraham,\n\nAs a method for working with daylight and\u00a0energy simulations,\u00a0I\u00a0created a simple geometry sort of\u00a0a\u00a0generic box (space) that we use plot ideal results which are then compared against the\u00a0results\u00a0 coming out of\u00a0a given project. I will use this method to see if there is any differences between different versions of EP.\n\nThanks for the tip\n\n\n\nYou are right about my last sentence.\n\n\n\ncheers\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "October 9, 2015 at 9:02pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1375791", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1376640"}
