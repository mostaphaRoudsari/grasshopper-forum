{"body": "\nHello again,\n\n\n\nI have been trying to get this running with no success.\n\n\n\nThe beam radiation component cannot load. In the description it says, the hourly beam gain including ladybug header. I was under the impression this was an input from \"windowBeam energy\" output of the energyplus simulation. If someone can clarify this point.\n\n\n\nAlso, I would be eternally grateful if you have a screenshot of a wired energy shade benefit evaluation, from a zone with multiple windows. I am pretty sure I am doing something wrong with the trees but it's getting late and harder to see mistakes.\n\n\n\nThanks very much in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 16, 2015 at 07:22AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Energy Shade Benefit Evaluation", "id": "topic_1225455"}
