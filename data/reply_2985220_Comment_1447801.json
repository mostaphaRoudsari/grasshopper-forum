{"body": "\nYes,\n\n\n\nWell I am going to be very cheap on the quality side :) Probably medium to high grids as well. Quality will increase when alternatives are narrowed down.\n\n\n\nI will use OpenFoam to do the CFD studies, this is a quite typical wind tunnel model, quite straightforward to formulate. I can share my case folder if you're interested.\n\n\n\nHopefully, in the near future we will have Butterfly ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly)) up and running in order to integrate CFD in the parametric design process, which would really transform CFD assessments!\n\n\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 9:06pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447881", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447801"}
