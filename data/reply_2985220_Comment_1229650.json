{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you both for your answers. Eventually there were two problems:\n\n\n\n1. Whenever I re-open my gh files GH asks me to let ladybug and honeybee fly since all the used components are red. Recomputing or disabling/enabling the two components works but not always, as such I had to use new ones. At one of these times though I had one Honeybee_Honeybee component forgotten on the canvas that did probably overwrite my data. I erased it and send the one in use back as Chris suggested and the simulation ran with my new material!\n\n\n\n2. I am using parallels on a mac where the directory on files that are saved in shared folders between the two systems are quite long and complicated. I was saving my EP calculations to one of them and this seemed to cause badly written .idf files. I moved the target directory to a local (C:\\) file and the EP can now normally read them and re-edit them!\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am using the latest updates from GitHub, the only paradox in the problem mentioned above is that the readme output of the EP simulation component was giving everytime a different set of severe errors that (in my understanding) reads back from the generated EP file (is that correct?) which is weird since the files were not written properly!\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo far so good! Thanks again for your replies!\u00a0\n\n\n\nTasos\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 3:46pm", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228568", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1229650"}
