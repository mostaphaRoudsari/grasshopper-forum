{"body": "\nHello everybody,\n\nI have some problem with reading the hourly(and annual)result when I have dynamic shading, it writes me that I have different number of point groups as annual profiles.\u00a0\n\nAnd I know that point groups are regarded to mesh etc. but this is a really siply testbox 10x10x3m ,where is just one floor (mesh). (above it is the chart for shading operation)\n\nCan anybody help me with that ?\n\nThanks a lot\n\nPeter\n\n<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/klmPPeYfCPgetlsVZ-DPSiUH3peHOka7G3WvkNxkFaRnK4YnVcWRuaPknUTfnyyVZURzSAZ2YYLc2vd-zGJbeJkSx*J50RCY/annual_profile_doesntmatch.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Za\u0165ko", "created_at": "October 10, 2014 at 6:54am", "created_by": "PeterZatko", "topic": "annual profiles doesnt math with the point groups", "id": "topic_1146615"}
