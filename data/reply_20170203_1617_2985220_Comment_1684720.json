{"body": "\nHey - to elaborate further than below, I am not concerned if one point receives sunlight for 50% of the time. I need to find out for how long is the entire surface receiving at least 50% sunlight coverage. So if at 10am only 40% of the surface is getting sunlight then that time wont count, but if at 11am the surface is getting 50% sunlight coverage then that will count towards how long in total it receives 50% or more.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "ClaudiavV", "created_at": "February 03, 2017 at 04:17PM", "created_by": "ClaudiavV", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1683874", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1684720"}
