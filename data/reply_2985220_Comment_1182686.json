{"body": "\nHi Masoome,\n\nHi Masoome,\n\nI should have seen that you had started a discussion before posting to the group.\n\nSince that posting, I have realized that, by mid-plane blinds, you meant blinds in between two panes of glass. \u00a0I have spent an hour just now trying to work in the capability of this within the typical shades workflow that I set up but the issue is a lot larger than I have realized. \u00a0In order to run blinds between two panes of glass through E+, you have to set up a construction that contains a \"WindowMaterial:Blind:EquivalentLayer\" in the window construction. \u00a0Accordingly, to integrate this into HB now, I have to create a whole new material type of\u00a0Blind:EquivalentLayer and I will have to find some other way of allowing people to set the shading control when they create this material. \u00a0How urgent is your need for blinds between glass and would it be possible for you to just pot-process your IDF with the IDFEditor for the time being?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 6, 2014 at 4:00pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182145", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182686"}
