{"body": "\nHi Dimitrios,\n\n\n\nI'm not an expert in BRE standards so I don't know what is the analysis period based on the code; but back to your question to calculate sunlight hours for\u00a021 Sept -21 March the attached file was correct. I just did three minor modifications:\n\n\n\n1. If you are using analysisPeriod input then hour, day and month component will be disabled. As you can see in the attached file I removed day, month and hour inputs and it just works fine.\n\n\n\n2. Make sure you are using the same timeStep for sunlightHours and sunpath components. I just connected the same slider to both inputs. You can go as accurate as a minute but it may take a while to calculate!\n\n\n\n3. Set parallel to True so the component will use all the CPUs for the calculation. It makes a big difference if you run the analysis for so many test points.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1044232", "name": "APSH_Test_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 14, 2014 at 06:54PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1044324", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1044230"}
