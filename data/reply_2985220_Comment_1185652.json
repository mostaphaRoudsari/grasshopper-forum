{"body": "\nThat is great that the setpoints schedule is fixed! \u00a0I was trying to use it the other day and I should have just asked you to check it instead of editing the HVAC availability. \u00a0I noticed that the updated WriteIDF anf HB_HB components have not yet been committed to the github. \u00a0Let me know when you do this as I would like to see the changes that you made (if only to understand better how E+ is dealing with setpoint schedules).\n\nGlad that you liked the GH definition. \u00a0Yes, Nat vent is going to help a lot. \u00a0I am going write a big post to the NatVent github issue shortly. \u00a0I have been understanding a lot better the different ways that E+ can model nat vent and I think I have carved out a chunk that I am going to implement.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 10, 2014 at 10:57pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1185818", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1185652"}
