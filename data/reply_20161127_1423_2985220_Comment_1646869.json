{"body": "\nHello and thanks for your response. I need to set one single node for my sensor, because in reality, I will have one sensor per room rather than a grid-based arrangement of sensors. And I only need to collect annual data for that single node in my rooms.\u00a0\n\nI could create annual DL analysis successfully before. I want to be able to pick nodes for my sensors in each room. If you could help me with that, I would be more than thankful.\u00a0\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 27, 2016 at 02:23PM", "created_by": "LillyGD", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1646546", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1646869"}
