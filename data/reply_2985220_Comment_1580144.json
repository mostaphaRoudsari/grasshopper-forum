{"body": "\nHi Grasshope (Ji?),\n\nThank you for the in-detail report. Everything is working fine on your machine. The error is either because of meshing or the boundary condition which is an OpenFOAM error and doesn't have to do much with butterfly workflow. I'll wait for Theodore input for the error itself.\n\nThe reason that you need to run the container manually is to make sure it's installed and running on your system with no issues. We probably can automate this step eventually but for now you need to run OpenFOAM manually **once** and leave it open in the background. Then you can run as many analysis as you want using butterfly.\n\nI'm very excited to see more users are now running butterfly successfully. A couple of more weeks and we will have the public release! :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 11, 2016 at 6:08am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579683", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1580144"}
