{"body": "\nHi Angel,\n\nSorry for responding so late. \u00a0I updated your GH file to the latest version, which gives you a better summary of the error report. \u00a0My diagnosis is that all of the roof geometry is running though E+ but the \"ImportIDF\" component is having trouble rebuilding the geometry from the IDF because the Rhinocommon \"JoinBreps\" function is really buggy (It's an issue on McNeel's end that goes back to the fact that rhino is a surface modeler and does not do operations of joining things into solids well).\n\nMore important than the ImportIDF is that the solar distribution function is not running correctly in your file and you can see this as a comment bubble in the attached GH file. \u00a0You should break up the roof into a few zones that are not concave if you want this to be correct. \u00a0Lastly, you forgot to solve adjacencies on you zones so I added that in.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1278873", "name": "HouseSimulationCWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 12:46pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1268478", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1278872"}
