{"body": "\nHi again.\n\nThis is the second example comparing LB_Pet and EM_Pet. As you can see they are practically the same (which is good). Now with the same palette of colors.\n\nWhat i WISH now in the LB_ENVImet is importing also the vegetation from EM.\n\nFor the case in the image there are a \"lot\" of trees affecting the PET which are not in the imported model. Without them is sometimes difficult to explain the results.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UNdbGkqHoSoB-HH29ApW8ynRHHoKb7U-eVUoPiYSrW3qGlvOwYESpa1u36qleWmnrN-Rc9TCt64Eirxbq3mpAr5l16MkzJWJ/20170227_125829.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UNdbGkqHoSoB-HH29ApW8ynRHHoKb7U-eVUoPiYSrW3qGlvOwYESpa1u36qleWmnrN-Rc9TCt64Eirxbq3mpAr5l16MkzJWJ/20170227_125829.jpg)\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 27, 2017 at 5:05am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701414", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701206"}
