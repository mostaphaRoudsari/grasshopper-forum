{"body": "\nHello All,\n\n\n\nI am running a solar radiation analysis using ladybug. I am was curious whether it was normal that the analysis has been running for almost an hour. The geometry is fairly simple for the purposes of this model but the geometry I will be testing is a bit more complex. Is this normal or does this mean something is wrong with one of the components.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\nMelissa\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "April 1, 2016 at 11:11am", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "topic": "Ladybug and honeybee", "id": "topic_1498351"}
