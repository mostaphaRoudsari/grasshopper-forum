{"body": "\nThis is a permission issue and happening for the same reason.\n\n\n\nLet's do this. If you check output of Ladybug_Ladybug component it should tell you where the default folder is set to. It can be C:\\Ladybug or\u00a0C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\\. Can you check and see if the folder is already created? If not can you create it and let the Honeybee fly again?\n\n\n\nAnother reason that I can think of is the %USERNAME% on your system.
