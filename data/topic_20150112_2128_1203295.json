{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Chris and everyone,\n\n\n\nI've run into a rather basic problem I fear while going through Chris' great youtube tutorials for Honeybee. When trying to run E+ through tutorial 6, even with the file directly downloaded from dropbox, I run into a \"1. Solution exception:too many values to unpack\" when I change the toggle from 'False' to 'True' for the Energy Simulation.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo try to fix it, I've downloaded the most up to date Ladybug + Honeybee versions from github, and then dragged those into Grasshopper. I've also dragged the icons from the panel onto the sheet. I tried changing the timestep to 'monthly' (in the video, it's 'hourly') but I still get the same error.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for any insight!\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1203294", "name": "Running a Basic Energy SimulationNX.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1203529", "name": "Capture.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Nora Xu", "created_at": "January 12, 2015 at 09:28PM", "created_by": "NoraXu", "topic": "\"too many values to unpack\" error with Part 6 of the Honeybee video tutorials", "id": "topic_1203295"}
