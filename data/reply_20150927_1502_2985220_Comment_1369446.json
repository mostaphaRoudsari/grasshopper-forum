{"body": "Thanks as always, Abraham, for being the ever-present sentinel of the forums.\n\nEsteban,\nI believe that this is a property of nearly all materials when light shines into a corner or onto a set of perpendicular planar surfaces. It is not the result of the specularity of the material but just the fact that you just get a lot of light bouncing back and forth between the two perpendicular surfaces as they get closer to intersecting one another regardless of whether the light is reflected specularly or diffusely. My intuition tells me that decreasing the overall reflectance of the material might diminish this effect but I don't think that you will be able to get rid off f it without the simulation no longer being \"physics-based.\"\n\nMostapha is the master of Honeybee radiance and he might have more insight into this.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 27, 2015 at 03:02PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1369362", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1369446"}
