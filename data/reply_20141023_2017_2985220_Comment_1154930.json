{"body": "\nWesley,\n\nGlad that the radiation issue was solved. \u00a0The best thing that we offer right now in terms of wind is a 3D wind profile curve that shows you roughly how the wind speed will go up as you increase with height. \u00a0I know that this is traditionally how a lot of wind calculations for structures were done before the invention of wind tunnels.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Mostapha said, we will hopefully have CFD capabilities in the future so that you could actually look at the wind field as it moves over and around your building and its context.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1154932", "name": "Wind Profile Visualizer.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 23, 2014 at 08:17PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1153081", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1154930"}
