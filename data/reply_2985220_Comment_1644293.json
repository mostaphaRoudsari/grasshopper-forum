{"body": "\nHi Olivier,\n\n\n\nI second Mostapha's suggestions. I would start with a 2D case in which you can actually increase the mesh quality and still have it run incredibly fast. Also the buyoant solver in the Heat Transfer recipy can consider all heating/temperature effects. You can assign temperatures to walls, bodies or other surfaces, even the air.\n\n\n\nInteresting stuff, keep us updated.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "November 22, 2016 at 5:48pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1583603", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1644293"}
