{"body": "\nHi Mostapha!\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply. I tried exploring the options you suggested. However, ended up messing up with the model. So, I thought the best idea would be to manually edit the IDF file in idfeditor. However, when I am importing the same idf file (modelled in HB, edited in idf editor), it doesn't seem to work. I am attaching the idf, GH file and .epw file for your reference. Could you please look in to it and let me know if there is a problem with the file?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nRam\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1533582", "name": "AllSGUNorthDGU.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1533583", "name": "IDFreader.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1533584", "name": "ZWE_Harare.677750_IWEC.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Ram Joshi", "created_at": "May 19, 2016 at 10:53pm", "created_by": "RamJoshi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1533543", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1533580"}
