{"body": "Abraham,\nThat is a nice paper on thermal mass and the results make sense to me. The effect of thermal mass on the peak temperature is usually huge and is overlooked by simple psych chart studies like this one that focus on the % time that you can use a certain strategy fall inside a comfort polygon (rather than how much more comfortable the worst-case scenario is).\n\nYour rules of thumb for solarHeatCapacity look good and the only thing that I would clarify when you use them is that they assume clear double pane glazing without a low-E coating, which is normal for a project that is trying to maximise passive solar heating on a southern exposure.\n\nAs for the time constants, they also look good, although I would add that the time constant is a function of BOTH thermal mass and thermal resistance (insulation). In the most extreme case of a high mass passivehaus, you would have a time constant around 36-48 hours. Most code compliant buildings in the US with exposed concrete floors would have a time constants around the default 8 hrs. 12 hrs seems to be a good value for a building that is a bit better than code with exposed massive floors and walls.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 10, 2017 at 02:20AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1811351", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1811467"}
