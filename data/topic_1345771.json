{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am trying to build a residencial building diferenciating the core from the apartment areas, I've drawn the geometry in many different ways and multiple times but I can get the Solve adjacencies to work properly and identify all the interior walls. I assume it is a geometry problem but I even draw from points to make sure the corners matched and still nothing.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions? The gh file is attached.\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nBlanca\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1345770", "name": "solveadjacencies.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Blanca Dasi Espuig", "created_at": "August 19, 2015 at 9:34am", "created_by": "BlancaDasiEspuig", "topic": "Solve Adjacencies", "id": "topic_1345771"}
