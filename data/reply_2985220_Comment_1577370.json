{"body": "\nVinu,\n\nI realized that it was just easier to just add an additional option on the Export to OpenStudio component rather than only put it on the Re-Run OSM component.\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/180fed9591481fa...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/180fed9591481fa394070e589c5ba02270d3d77a)\n\nIf you sync with the github, you will notice that you can now plug a \"3\" into the Export to OpenStudio component and the component will generate the IDF file but not run it through EnergyPlus.\n\nThanks for the suggestion and let me know if this works well for you.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 6, 2016 at 4:41pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571902", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1577370"}
