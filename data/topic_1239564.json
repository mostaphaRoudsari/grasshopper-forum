{"body": "\nHi Honeybee team,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if it's possible to run the annual / daysim simulation in -dds mode, where instead of 65 sun positions the software considers 2305 sun positions? It would increase accuracy by quite a bit. (And if you use -dds -s option, you get climate-dependent sun positions).\u00a0\n\n\n\nIs there some way to hack that or would it require a big change in the simulation recipe component?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reinier Zeldenrust", "created_at": "March 9, 2015 at 2:07pm", "created_by": "ReinierZeldenrust", "topic": "Daysim -dds option", "id": "topic_1239564"}
