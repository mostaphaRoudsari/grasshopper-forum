{"body": "\nDear Dragonfly developers,\n\nFirst of all, thanks for having implemented this plugin, which seems very powerful for the UHI assessment... but in the same time potentially dangerous with many default data with high impact and far from easy to customize.\n\nI'm trying\u00a0 to use and understand the Dragonfly_Boundary_Layer_Parameters block, whose parameter setting seems to have a huge impact on the UHI results. In particular the nightBndLayerHeight parameter. First of all, the default value in the doc (800m) does not correspond to the one in the code (80m). After having set it at 800m with a constant block, the RunUWG component doesn't run until the end, giving the following error message : \"Error in ReferenceSite/VerticalDifussionModel (line 141) / Error in xml_new (line 394)\". It seems that some combinaisons of nightBndLayerHeight / referenceHeight work (80 / 100 or 800 / 800) and others not (800 / 100).\n\nDoes that comes from the model preparation? Or the UWG algorithm itself?\n\nI tried to find for some \"tables\" linking these weather layers to the different urban typologies... without success. Would have someone ref / paper recommandations?\n\nKind regards,\n\nRom\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Romain Nouvel", "created_at": "September 13, 2017 at 09:15AM", "created_by": "RomainNouvel", "topic": "[Dragongfly] Boundary Layer parametrization", "id": "topic_1812960"}
