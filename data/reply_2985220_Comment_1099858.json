{"body": "\nHi Chris, Djordje and Ben, Thank you for your thoughtful comments.\n\nFor me one of the most important aspects of the platform is ease of contribution from the community. I picture that the majority of the contents come from the community of the users and not the developers for multiple reasons.\n\nFor this reason I would vote for a wiki similar to Blender which is build using MediaWiki ([http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)). It is easy to maintain, already designed for wiki and easy to get users involved. The only issue is probably setting it up for the first time which will probably need a great amount of effort.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 9, 2014 at 8:39pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1098315", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1099858"}
