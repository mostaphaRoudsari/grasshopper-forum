{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nA couple of things for your attention:\n\n1. On the LB Sunpath component when you add a conditional statement it writes \"**Conditiontional**\" on screen (I'm not sure if i reported this before, but just in case).\n\n2. I don't understand why when i open the attached file it didn't run the LB Analysis period. But if i close it and open again it does. I can also make it work if i change one of the sliders.\n\n\n\nBTW i'll llove to test the updated version ... if you wish :-)\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A869086", "name": "TMP.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 09, 2013 at 03:12PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "A couple of (mini) bugs", "id": "topic_869087"}
