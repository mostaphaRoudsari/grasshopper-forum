If memory serves me right, when I set the EPZoneLoads The infiltration per Area (the miniscule amount) gets interpreted as 0. I suppose it so small it exceeds the tolerance.\u00a0\n\nI know it may sound ridiculous (an infiltration rate of 0.03 per m2) but certain design criteria and standards are getting very strict with air tightness.\u00a0\n\nI'll have a look on Monday and will post my findings along with an example file.\u00a0\n\nbest,\u00a0\n\nMauricio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mauricio Aguilar Cardenas", "created_at": "February 6, 2016 at 4:41pm", "created_by": "MauricioAguilarCardenas135", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1456051", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1456717"}
