{"body": "\nHi Chris\n\n\n\nJust to confirm - works for me as well. I had been having issues with OpenStudio 2.02 and variants. HB could not find them. Thought it was the \\Program Files location of previous versions - so reinstalled a couple of different ways.\n\n\n\nNow, IF I run the HB updater, \u00a0the new 'fly' component finds OpenStudio 2.1 in the C:\\ drive folder that is now the default location of OpenStudio.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nM\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Michael Donn", "created_at": "May 02, 2017 at 06:44AM", "created_by": "MichaelDonn", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1744433", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1744347"}
