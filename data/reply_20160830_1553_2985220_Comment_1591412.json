{"body": "\nHi Mona,\n\n\n\nTry the attached file. The IES file is embeded in the gh definition. So you don't have to do anything to it. It should just create the view shown below automatically.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hglJbwhHCCbdy82RVCdFKQgqmyqxHq9dR2d*2UvFQdhUVJmVPF8cOXs4rbnBRJnWUp7gjbMevEbclXhwOntFDbFOJRcbVoLk/830201655039PM.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hglJbwhHCCbdy82RVCdFKQgqmyqxHq9dR2d*2UvFQdhUVJmVPF8cOXs4rbnBRJnWUp7gjbMevEbclXhwOntFDbFOJRcbVoLk/830201655039PM.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case it doesn't work can you send me a screenshot of the Output From MSH2RAD part of the gh file on your system. You can see the screenshot from mine in the image above. It might be that the Mesh isn't converting to Radiance definitions on your system.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "August 30, 2016 at 03:53PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1591004", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1591412"}
