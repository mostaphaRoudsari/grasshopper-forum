{"body": "\nHello Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for your help, the definition works fine now!\n\nThere was another issue I mentioned in my first post; if you try to include the geometry of the roof in the context, then the simulation does not conclude properly (please see the image attached).\n\nI feel this is again due to the geometry of the roof which I could simplify. However, I was wondering if you were able to understand what is causing the problem?\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nCarmelo\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1811540", "name": "roof shading.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Carmelo G.
