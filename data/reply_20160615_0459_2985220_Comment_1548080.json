{"body": "\nHi Claudia\n\n\n\nI checked your model and it is a geometry issue. There were two sets of surfaces on the NW and SE that I have coloured red that were messing up in honeybee. Joining and exploding seems to be a quick fix.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn these instances I bake a wireframe from the HBZones to see if there are any double counting of curves. If there are then this tends to be the problem area as there should only be one edge curve.\n\n\n\n(oh also one of your walls was on a floor layer - I've changed that too)\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nDuncan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1548082", "name": "Floor.3_DCdm.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "June 15, 2016 at 04:59AM", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1548125", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1548080"}
