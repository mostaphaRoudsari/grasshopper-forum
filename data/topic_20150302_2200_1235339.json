{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI am designing an office tower floor which has a series of different vertical glazing and opaque (aluminum) layers.\n\n\n\nIn order to do this I used a chain of add glazing components, separating the layers with different properties. I also used the glazing component to add an aluminum composite panel (any other better way?perhaps setting the whole wall as a panel and then cut the window parts?). Everything seemed to work ok. No errors and in the preview it is clearly visible that the window is separated in layers.\n\n\n\nHowever when I plug them in the create zones component they do not show up. When I plug only them, then only the first glazed surface plugged in shows up. Anything after that won't display.\n\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\n\nEdit: Found this [http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topic/search?group...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topic/search?groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987&amp;q=multiple+glazing), and realized the surfaces are there just not displaying in the create zones component. Will try simulations to make sure.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1235338", "name": "OfficeTower.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 02, 2015 at 10:00PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Adding multiple glazing on a single surface", "id": "topic_1235339"}
