{"body": "\nI am analyzing a geometry like shown in the picture.\n\nExcept I added a round base (not shown), to see how the mass affects the ground in terms of solar radiation.\n\nladybug radiation analysis grid size 2,\u00a0\n\nand its been using nearly 30gigs of ram.\n\ncausing other programs i'm using to slow down quite alot.\n\nits been many hours now too. and I am thinking maybe there are too many details or I might not be able to do too many analysis.\n\nSince it is written in python, i wonder if there is possibly a memory leak issue here?\n\nseems like there was a discussion by mr heumann about ghpython performance issue\u00a0[here](http://discourse.mcneel.com/t/new-ghpython-issues-crashing-multithreading-performance/4817)\u00a0especially when its running in parallel.\n\nand if it just has to do with the geometry or how I have prepared it, I am wondering if there is a possibility of putting a max ram usage like in a photoshop.\n\nThis way at least I will be able to do other things while the radiation analysis finishes.\n\nProbably hard to achieve but I wanted to ask if it is possible.[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DNRCvs-5-8EHMeXfJ4LWIu0aTZKsClsoS7s-2QZnMInJM*pTHqWZupj8xq39DbOPdosG2v0um3wKiW2J6zquARVx-5x2iEeM/flyover_024.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DNRCvs-5-8EHMeXfJ4LWIu0aTZKsClsoS7s-2QZnMInJM*pTHqWZupj8xq39DbOPdosG2v0um3wKiW2J6zquARVx-5x2iEeM/flyover_024.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DNRCvs-5-8H3Ozn0wu*r47eZT7JA-A9ebvNXx0wLSZSoyVHtg7ruVVnmbLetrflvw7JTa8rMU6NzogDx0y7DB1qfOw1Nw2dS/free_024.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DNRCvs-5-8H3Ozn0wu*r47eZT7JA-A9ebvNXx0wLSZSoyVHtg7ruVVnmbLetrflvw7JTa8rMU6NzogDx0y7DB1qfOw1Nw2dS/free_024.png)\n\nin this img you can see that the grid size is not super fine - to me I dont know if I can lower the grid size too much from because I want to get information about detailing the facade system.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "November 17, 2014 at 12:28AM", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "topic": "radiation analysis - taking very long and using 30gigs of ram. too much detail or memory leak?", "id": "topic_1169961"}
