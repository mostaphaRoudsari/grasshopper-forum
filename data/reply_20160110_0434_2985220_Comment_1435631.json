{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for your responses.\n\n\n\nDoes this mean that at the moment, and in the absence of precipitation data in the weather file, the outside convection coefficient is always set at \"dry\"? Or I guess they could contain a boolean for rainfall that sets israining on?\n\n\n\nThat connection sounds amazing Chris. I really should take a look at the work done in Dragonfly, I've neglected that.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 10, 2016 at 04:34AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435190", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435631"}
