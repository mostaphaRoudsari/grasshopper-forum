{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI've changed all the tolerances in Rhino to 0.0001 but I still can't get the windows that I draw in Rhino to be planar with the zone surface.\n\nI've even tried baking the surface from GH to Rhino and then drawing a new full window surface around the points of the baked surface and then changed the size to match the required window size and I still can't get the windows to get on the same planar surface.\u00a0\n\nThis is driving me crazy and wasting many hours. Do you have any further advice about how to get the windows onto the stupid zone?\n\n<br/>Chelle\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1489275", "name": "GNR Honeybee zones.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1489276", "name": "Great North Rd Energy Model.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chelle Payne", "created_at": "March 20, 2016 at 7:08pm", "created_by": "ChellePayne", "parent_id": "topic_1487959", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489274"}
