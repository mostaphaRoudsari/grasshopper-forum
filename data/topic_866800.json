{"body": "\nHello Mostafa,\n\nI am using the Radiation analysis component. The result is always 0\n\nand I have noticed that the output of the GenCumulativeSky component,\n\nthe\u00a0GenCumSkyResult is always 0 in all the items. The epw weather file and\n\nthe\u00a0GenCumulativeSky.exe are working properly. Can you imagine some issue?\n\nI attach an image of the definition. As you can see from the Panel attached to the\n\ngenCumSkyResult output all the items are 0 (up to the 25th line is visible but also\n\nall the others are). The report output says that \"There were 3 sun up hours in this climate file\", is it ok? Thank you.\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AMgcP5snh*Adh-f64-rVNv*zPLAYze09JIPoo8cHRPZdge5T-N92D5cyM*cU5fzn-XifbcSENSJy3nBBwDXuqVjnyMe-4WAR/ProblemSolarRadiation0.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AMgcP5snh*Adh-f64-rVNv*zPLAYze09JIPoo8cHRPZdge5T-N92D5cyM*cU5fzn-XifbcSENSJy3nBBwDXuqVjnyMe-4WAR/ProblemSolarRadiation0.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "June 6, 2013 at 2:52am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "Radiation calculation problem", "id": "topic_866800"}
