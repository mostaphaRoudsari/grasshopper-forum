{"body": "\nThanks A\n\nWhat I looking for is very simple. Just to get the hourly operative temperature for my zones. (8760 entries for each zone). \u00a0I dont understand well the average data for hourly records well. that I understand is that the hourly value averaged hourly is the same value.\n\nFinally the diference betwen the max and min values for average and not average results in my case has a diferences of 6\u00b0C. So im not sure what values to take (averaged or not).\n\nMy idea is to show bar chart and 3d chart with operative temperature, but their diferents values makes that Im not sure what is the right for my purpose. (just operative temperature)\n\nagain Thanks !!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "jP Trujillo Levy", "created_at": "October 28, 2016 at 10:47am", "created_by": "JuanPabloTrujilloLevy", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1627946", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1628157"}
