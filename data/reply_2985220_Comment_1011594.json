{"body": "\nThank you for responding for me, Mostapha. \u00a0The last few days have been pretty busy. \u00a0I have attached a GH definition that shows how to use my solar fan and envelope components. \u00a0I would suggest opening the GH definition with a weather file that does not generate too many sun vectors for the criteria that I list in the sunpath conditional statement. \u00a0If more than 500 vectors are being used to construct the solar fan or envelope, the calculation can take upwards of a minute. \u00a0Let me know if you have any other questions, Petar.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1011595", "name": "Solar Fan and Envelope Final2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 18, 2014 at 10:08pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1009367", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1011594"}
