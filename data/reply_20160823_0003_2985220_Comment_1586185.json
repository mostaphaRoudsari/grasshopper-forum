{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nProbably the dumb questions are on my side ...\n\nSome progress was made, but still standing on the same spot.\n\nUpdated BF, restarted Rhino and GH = No results.\n\nI enabled the VT-X/AMD-v in the BIOS as i noticed that i was required to do so. This is the progress i made. Now the file \"do something\". It takes about 4 minutes in the blockMesh component, so something is happening. But at the end of the 4 minutes i get the same error as before. Tried to run the start_OF.bat externally, but no use either.\n\nThose are the snapshots of both of them:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/J17TP1ZnHTdJlR1PH6JMZaw4qsBWKVeDv5lNjcIxKNPbXYoAyAkmd7PDzGqqAlx22SvkNcNhW8XgSiqARvEGQC70xs3WwfMJ/OF_03.JPG\" width=\"578\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J17TP1ZnHTdJlR1PH6JMZaw4qsBWKVeDv5lNjcIxKNPbXYoAyAkmd7PDzGqqAlx22SvkNcNhW8XgSiqARvEGQC70xs3WwfMJ/OF_03.JPG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/J17TP1ZnHTezYD9aoaKKn8k2O1VU60O6azdU5nZUB0rjeHhS3ZtKJilPqzj91z13a2e2oU15RN-bGuJyNDQK*2sZW8-SBpeC/OF_04.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J17TP1ZnHTezYD9aoaKKn8k2O1VU60O6azdU5nZUB0rjeHhS3ZtKJilPqzj91z13a2e2oU15RN-bGuJyNDQK*2sZW8-SBpeC/OF_04.JPG)Be patient ... and bear with me.

There is a chance it is related to the firewall of my university, or some other security issue for those trying to apply virtual machines/hosting.\n\nI'll try at home in the evening.\n\nA more detailed image of the shell running the batch file manually:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/J17TP1ZnHTc5BeTEwsavoAOXb2pausQkcgKz*Uq3quwg6ZbG5LgRX1NDMNhfvUg96ujGRAVhO302jgTQ2SYdVWwxmPOXfeC7/OF_03a.JPG\" width=\"581\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/J17TP1ZnHTc5BeTEwsavoAOXb2pausQkcgKz*Uq3quwg6ZbG5LgRX1NDMNhfvUg96ujGRAVhO302jgTQ2SYdVWwxmPOXfeC7/OF_03a.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 23, 2016 at 12:03AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1586156", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1586185"}
