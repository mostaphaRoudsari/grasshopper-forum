{"body": "\nHi Theodoros,\n\nThe studies and comparisons you talk about when assessing the accuracy, are they possible to get access to? Results, approaches, methods, graphs or pictures, or what ever you might have(?).\n\nThey interest me due to my ongoing master thesis on CFD and parametric simulations of the climates in atria buildings.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nLasse Hamborg: Stud.
