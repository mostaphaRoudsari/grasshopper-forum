{"body": "\nDear Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you for your response. I have tried both of them. The problem is that this component does not capture the recolormesh result. It just captures the plan without any simulation results when I set it to automatically save 9 images. So I have to do it one by one and it will be so time consuming. If you can help me find the problem with my file it will be awesome and I will really appreciate that. Thank you so much.\n\n\n\nLooking forward for your response.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mitra Sajjadi", "created_at": "October 28, 2016 at 10:01pm", "created_by": "MitraSajjadi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1628481", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1628514"}
