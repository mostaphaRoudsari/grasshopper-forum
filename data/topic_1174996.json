{"body": "\nHi Everyone\n\n\n\nI an new to grasshopper and new to honeybee. I have created a room with numerous perforations in rhino. I was wondering how I could map the thermal grid within the room in grasshopper. I have been trying to follow 4th grid script example you guys posted but I just wasn't able to follow the reasons behind it, can any of you put me through the step by step process of how i would approach this. The design im using is attached below.\n\n\n\nThanks alot\u00a0\n\nDennis\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1174995", "name": "Capture.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Dennis", "created_at": "November 24, 2014 at 7:43pm", "created_by": "Dennis", "topic": "Interior Grid Analysis", "id": "topic_1174996"}
