{"body": "\nHi Francesco,\n\nFor as long as I can remember, the sunlight hours component has always been like that. \u00a0As has the radiation analysis component and the view analysis component (although I recently added in a _gemetryBlockView input). \u00a0Perhaps you are thinking back to a time when Ladybug was less than 6 months old?\n\nIn any case, you can get around this issue by grafting your input _geometry so that each building is on its own branch. \u00a0This will have the component run two separate sunlight hours studies for each branch (or building) instead of one combined study.I would strongly recommend this over your multiple components strategy, Devang, although you are onto the right solution. \u00a0Generally, any time that you feel the urge to copy/paste a component, you should first consider trying to graft an input instead. \u00a0This will keep your canvass much cleaner.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 11, 2017 at 6:41pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1670058", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1670358"}
