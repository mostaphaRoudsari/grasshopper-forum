{"body": "\nWe can and we will get to the place to handle large files like this. There are a couple of items that needs to be addressed before we get there.\n\n\n\nFor comparison studies to Daysim you should use the Annual Recipe. That is using the daylight coefficient recipe to run the analysis and similar to the Daysim workflow it doesn't load the results for each test point for calculating the annual metrics.\n\n\n\nHere is the good news. If you copy your current files under the annual folder and change the recipe to annual and leave reuseMtx to True the component will read the results without re-running the analysis. That should give you the option to compare the values. No window group is supported though.\n\n\n\nAs I said there are solutions to be developed for specific cases. Keep us posted on your findings, needs and suggestions.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "11 hours ago", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1806437", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1806549"}
