{"body": "\nHi,\n\nNames are already changed, thank you. Your material runs perfectly on my computer, predefined E+-Materials also.\n\nAnother thing I'm curious: The material you created: In the code there is the reference to \"C:/Ladybug/userCustomLibrary.idf\". But I can't find it nowhere, neither within the E+.idf\n\nThe thing is I'm curious about how E+ is constructing that construction layer as material and see the details for copying it in userCustomLibrary.idf (if not already there)...\n\nTHX,\n\nD\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "July 03, 2015 at 07:57AM", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1319672", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1319599"}
