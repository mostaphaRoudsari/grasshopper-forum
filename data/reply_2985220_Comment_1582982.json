{"body": "\nHi again,\n\nSome months after I came up with the idea, I am finally trying to use the GroundDomain in Honeybee for a single-storey building with a slab on grade.\n\nWhen I asked the previous question, I forgot that apart from changing the boundary condition and adding the strings for the other necessary EP objects (in my case: \"Site:GroundTemperature:Undisturbed:Xing\", \"Site:GroundDomain:Slab\" and \"SurfaceProperty:OtherSideConditionsModel\"), it is needed to change the Outside Boundary Condition Object field of the \"BuildingSurface:Detailed\" to the name given to the SurfaceProperty:OtherSideConditionsModel object (in my case: oscm_slab).\n\nHow could I do this?\n\nFor some hours I have tried many possibilities, but I could not make it work. I attach a very simple HB model ready to be run with the Ground Domain object once this last issue is solved.\n\nThank you!!<br/>Jorge\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1582984", "name": "OSCM_test.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1582985", "name": "Img02.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Jorge Conejo", "created_at": "August 17, 2016 at 10:26am", "created_by": "JorgeConejo", "parent_id": "topic_1528157", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1582982"}
