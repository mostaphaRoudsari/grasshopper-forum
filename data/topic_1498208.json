{"body": "\nHi\n\n\n\nI have a simple script to make a series of tower objects in a spreadsheet. These are read into Grasshopper using Bumblebee and the boundary objects are created as simple mesh boxes of the matching dimensions. I am also in a separate exercise reading some shape files (.shp format) of real buildings with database links to their heights so that I can extrude these towers from their boundary plan shapes to their real height - to visualise the city geometry.\u00a0\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot get the Ladybug or Honeybee geometry input functions to recognise these meshobjects. It seems the geometry input requires breps? But I cannot find a means of converting my geometry to a form that HB/LB can understand. Any help you can provide would be gratefully accepted.\n\n\n\nM\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Michael Donn", "created_at": "April 1, 2016 at 10:43am", "created_by": "MichaelDonn", "topic": "Ladybug / Honeybee not handling extruded polygon geometry?", "id": "topic_1498208"}
