{"body": "\nHi John,\n\n\n\nSorry for the late reply. I will ask OpenStudio development team about this. They may/should have documentation somewhere about all the default values in systems. To my knowledge (and it should be confirmed by Chris) we don't overwrite the default values that are coming from the template.\n\n\n\nFor now you can use OpenStudio app to open the osm files and access all the input values.\n\n\n\nBack to validation, Honeybee uses EnergyPlus, and OpenStudio which also uses EnergyPlus for running the simulations. We have done several checks to make sure the generated idf file matches the inputs from Grasshopper but haven't tried BESTTEST or similar test procedures.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 13, 2017 at 2:38pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749167", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1750901"}
