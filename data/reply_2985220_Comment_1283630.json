{"body": "\nHi Rania,\n\nOf course i remember :-)\n\nThe way i update is practically the same i saw you did in the file. But i ask to update the file instead all components. For all components i go the github, download the HB/LB.zip and replace in the UserObjects folder (manually). I know that using the update component can do the same, but i don't mind going there and see/read what components got updated lately.\n\nAs for your file, i didn't understand if it works or it didn't. As i said, i updated the file and changed the resolutions to low quality, ab 2 and size 240. It works for me.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 9, 2015 at 10:27pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1283728", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1283630"}
