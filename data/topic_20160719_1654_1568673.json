{"body": "\nHi Chris and Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI used Chris Mackey's example on Honeybee Window shade generator, I just changed the schedule parameters to on/off but the energy simulation output does not vary. And when the blinds are off, will the model show that the blinds are up?\n\nI have attached the file with both the conditions, could you tell me where I am making mistake? I am wondering whether I am making a mistake with the input parameters!\n\n\n\nThank you for the help!\n\nVinu\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1568672", "name": "blinds.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "July 19, 2016 at 04:54PM", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "topic": "Blinds Schedule", "id": "topic_1568673"}
