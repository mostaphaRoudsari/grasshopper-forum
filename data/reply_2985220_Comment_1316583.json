{"body": "\nI agree. We should have sort of query based results reader. It will be probably the best to do it through sql and not the csv file. I'm pretty sure we discussed this before and I think it's important to implement it at some point soon. There is a WIP component for read .sql results but I'm not sure how useful it is at this point of time.\n\n\n\nI'm also not sure if there is any other tool that can handle this amount of data and visualizes the results. Have you tried OpenStudio?\n\n\n\nThe only solution I can think of right now is to write a custom code to parse the results from the csv file which will probably take a considerable amount of time.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 27, 2015 at 1:17pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1315664", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1316583"}
