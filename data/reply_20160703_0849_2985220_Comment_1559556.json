{"body": "\nComing from a DIVA perspective here where I run most of my daylight, but I assume HBEE does it pretty much the same way - navigate to your project folder, find the batch file that launches the annual Daysim simulations, open it and add \"@pause\" to the batch file, last line. Save and run it again (by double clicking it straight in the folder, not through HBEE) - it will now not disappear once it fails, and you can read the error message. Then let us know what it says?\n\nBest,\n\nMax\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Max D", "created_at": "July 03, 2016 at 08:49AM", "created_by": "ButWhyprecisely", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1558868", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559556"}
