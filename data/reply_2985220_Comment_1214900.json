{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThanks for the clarification. \u00a0To answer the questions:\n\na. If you define the heating/cooling setpoints with custom CSV schedules, you will override anything that you have in the \"Set EP Zone Thresholds\" component. \u00a0The thresholds component only works if you are taking the original OpenStudio schedules assigned based on program. \u00a0If you take the original OpenStudio setpoint schedules, you should see that the setpoints show up under the schedules section.\n\nb. The max and min nat vent temperatures show up under the ZoneAirflow objects in the IDF (they are not schedules). \u00a0\n\nc. You are getting cooling loads bigger in winter than in summer because you are pulling the blinds every time that the outside temperature goes above 18 C (which does not happen in winter). \u00a0Looking at the total solar gain will help you understand this. \u00a0It is possible to shut off the cooling system with a schedule in the Ideal Air System template that we use. \u00a0I have not built in the functionality to do this in HB yet and, since it requires a schedule, it's difficult to do it manually by editing the IDF (I will do this soon).\n\nYou might also want to try adding in an an air side economizer to your ideal air system, which you can do with the new \"Set Ideal Air Loads Parameters\" component. \u00a0This will mix in more outside air when it is cool outside in winter.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 1, 2015 at 4:11am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1214855", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1214900"}
