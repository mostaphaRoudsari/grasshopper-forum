{"body": "\nHi Brian,\n\nThese seems like a good enough method for determining a period of natural ventilation if that is what you are going for (when you said that the results are for the \"comfort of the occupants\", I assumed that there is no cooling system). \u00a0I think that you will also find agreement with the ASHRAE Adaptive Comfort Standard, which states that you can have a free-running a building with natural ventilation in any month where the average monthly temperature is above 10C. I remember that, in NYC, this is from March to October.\n\nIf you want to be hard core about your shading study for comfort, I can recommend a workflow with the \"comfort shade benefit evaluator\" component that I have not gotten the chance to make a tutorial video for yet. \u00a0The attached file outlines how to do it in your case. \u00a0You have to run an energy simulation of unconditioned zones (free-running) for that analysis period that you just selected and you can use the resulting indoor temperature from the simulation to do a comfort shade benefit run. \u00a0This will ensure that you are blocking the sun that makes the inside of the building too hot but still letting in the sun when you want it in this period. \u00a0Of course, if you want to look at the effect of direct sun falling on occupants inside the building, that is a different ball game and one where you should use the \"Solar Adjusted Temperature\" component.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions of if this is helpful.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1160909", "name": "011_Comfort Shade Benefit Evaluation for Bldg.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 3, 2014 at 8:45pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1160988", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1160907"}
