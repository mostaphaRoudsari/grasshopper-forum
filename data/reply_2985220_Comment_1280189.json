{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\nWhat I want to add is that **the lighting schedule which used by the E+ simulation was generated by the daylight simulation (namely \"Honeybee_Read Annual Result I\" component). This means****\u00a0both E+ and Daylight simulations share the same\u00a0lighting schedule.** So I assume their results should be more or less similar or not that different, even though there might be some difference in their calculation methods.\u00a0\n\nBut, having tried many times, the result generated by the\u00a0\"Honeybee_Daysim Electrical Lighting Use\" is usually much less than that\u00a0generated by the\u00a0\"Honeybee_Read EP Result\" (**e.g. 160.5 kwh vs 369.425\u00a0kwh as in the current parameter**).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ytz*1w0-YzBtBDDqGt3QU25s8PMPcpjYbdmDe1EO*W813hTJqmnVtfpYnrsw3sFI-Ry*YgjgNNMK9o*d5X5skvqZ75yEEYhM/largedifference.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ytz*1w0-YzBtBDDqGt3QU25s8PMPcpjYbdmDe1EO*W813hTJqmnVtfpYnrsw3sFI-Ry*YgjgNNMK9o*d5X5skvqZ75yEEYhM/largedifference.png)\n\nIn addition, in\u00a0\"Honeybee_Lighting control Recipe\",\u00a0default parameters (lightingPower = 250, lightingSetpoint = 300, ballastLossFactor = 20, standbyPower = 3, delayTime = 5) were used in the current case except \"control type\" - [5] Always on during active occupancy hours with auto dimming.\n\nIn short, both\u00a0E+ and Daylight simulations have already shared the same lighting schedule. As for Control type and Lighting\u00a0Setpoint, they are only required in daylight simulation.\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "May 4, 2015 at 1:40pm", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280234", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280189"}
