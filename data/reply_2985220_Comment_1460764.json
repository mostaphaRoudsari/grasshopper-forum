{"body": "\nSorry I took so long to answer.\u00a0\n\nSo, if I use the default tolerance of the\u00a0\"ACH2m3/s-m2 Calculator\" (0.2), when setting infiltration to a very low value (that of passivhaus standards), conversion results as null. Which the \"Set Loads\" component interprets...well as a null, and therefore uses the default value of 0.0002. This ultimately results in a very different infiltration energy value as simulated by EP, see image named tolerance-2.jpg.\n\nBy comparison, if I change the tolerance of the calculator component (from 0.2 to 0.0001) I get an actual conversion which ultimately results in a lower infiltration energy value simulated by EP, see image named: tolerance-0001.jpg\n\nThis might seem as nitpicking but similar critical values are gaining popularity and I think should be adressed.\n\nPlease find attached the example gh file, epw files en custom material library not included...just substitute for your local files.\u00a0\n\nbest wishes,\u00a0\n\nMauricio\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1460765", "name": "tolerance-2.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1460766", "name": "example.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1460767", "name": "tolerance-0001.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Mauricio Aguilar Cardenas", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 9:49am", "created_by": "MauricioAguilarCardenas135", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1456717", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1460764"}
