{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nGood to hear from you.\n\nPoint 2: The only \"warning\" appears in the LB AnalysisPeriod component saying that i need first let the Ladybug fly ... which is set to true from the beginning. I toggle to false and then to true again but nothing. Just moving any of the sliders connected to the LB_AnalysisPeriod does it.\n\nMy email: ayez@ar.technion.ac.il\n\nOf course i won't be upset. On the contrary. I know how to appreciate work in progress. I'm into that myself.\n\nThanks a lot,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 18, 2013 at 2:13pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_874309", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_874612"}
