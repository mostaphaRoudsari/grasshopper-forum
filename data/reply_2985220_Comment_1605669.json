{"body": "\nHi Chris\n\nI followed your suggestions and did some more experiments. Multiplying the shadeneteffect values by the testregion area, as you have suggested, seems to yield more comparable results. I have attached the relevant gh definition to this post. You can see the result below:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hAXKVxAmtpLZabVLGmPgcEvhRW4b21cZTYnnpcjEPE0VFOsKqkDeIufBEtQeloyfeuc0R0-Ahh0NPNxKo0ocpnCVelCV9XX3/comparison.jpg?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hAXKVxAmtpLZabVLGmPgcEvhRW4b21cZTYnnpcjEPE0VFOsKqkDeIufBEtQeloyfeuc0R0-Ahh0NPNxKo0ocpnCVelCV9XX3/comparison.jpg)\n\nAssuming that each person occupies a fixed amount of space, a multiplication by the number of people should generate similar results. However, the metric would get even more complex (DegreeDays*no. of people/m2 of shade). On the contrary, the multiplication by the test region area creates an even simpler metric (DegreeDays) which might be used to compare \u201clevels of shading service (or disservice)\u201d between different shaded areas.\n\nAs you already mention, the existing metric is not \u201cwrong\u201d and has its own uses, so you could either clarify this in the component description or add the new metric as an output.\n\nBelow you can see a comparison of two cases from the study site I am currently investigating. The site is a waterfront located in Crete with mostly northern, western and northwestern orientations, so the yearly shade harm is insignificant. The multiplication of shadebenefit by site area seems to provide a better interpretation of the shadow effect.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hAXKVxAmtpLWB7VBANUN*n5VG7vFK0eWp4z3Y-ExV3syEkXa1k8gg4jPmSf5iq2i-DUOE95K1mxPHzvrmglAe5KJfyHyWzDe/existing_metric.JPG?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hAXKVxAmtpLWB7VBANUN*n5VG7vFK0eWp4z3Y-ExV3syEkXa1k8gg4jPmSf5iq2i-DUOE95K1mxPHzvrmglAe5KJfyHyWzDe/existing_metric.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hAXKVxAmtpLn8sD00rzC1p8ANM158BsJPnzBnbSflmYBIEyznV57M9TmrGeIoUIsW-NMKKoLpeUUKhxjeyUUQDAH8Y317NeE/mulitpliedbytestregion.JPG?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hAXKVxAmtpLn8sD00rzC1p8ANM158BsJPnzBnbSflmYBIEyznV57M9TmrGeIoUIsW-NMKKoLpeUUKhxjeyUUQDAH8Y317NeE/mulitpliedbytestregion.JPG)You can also observe that in the case of a west-facing site (case on the right) a horizontal shade has a smaller impact on thermal comfort (slightly lighter blue color) than southern/northern cases.\n\n\n\nBest Regards\n\nAris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1605671", "name": "Outdoor_Comfort_Shade_Benefit_2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Aris V", "created_at": "September 26, 2016 at 3:53am", "created_by": "ArisVartholomaios", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1604993", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1605669"}
