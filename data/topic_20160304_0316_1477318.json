{"body": "\nDear\u00a0Mostapha and all,\n\n\n\nFollowed by Francesco's\u00a0previous post ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/lighting-control-group-is...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/lighting-control-group-issue?groupUrl=ladybug&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987&amp;id=2985220%3ATopic%3A1241658&amp;page=2#comments)), I have some questions regarding the work mechanism of the lighting control in HB/Daysim.\n\n\n\n1)\u00a0**Which**\u00a0specific sensor point (out of many) in the \"lightingControlGroup\"\u00a0should fulfill the requirement of\u00a0**\"****lightingSetpoint\"**\u00a0(300lux)?\n\nin other words:\n\nDoes it mean that\u00a0the\u00a0**average illuminance**\u00a0calculated from\u00a0**all the \"sensorPoints\"**\u00a0in the \"lightingControlGroup\" (insteady of any single sensorPoint)\u00a0should\u00a0fulfill the\u00a0**\"****lightingSetpoint\"\u00a0**requirement?\n\nif this is the case:\n\nWhy the lighting schedule obtained from DSElectricalLightingUse is\u00a0**different\u00a0**from the\u00a0lighting schedule\u00a0obtained by post-processing/checking all the hourly illuminance results at all the sensorPoints? (please see the attach gh file edited from\u00a0Mostapha's version)\n\n\n\n2)\u00a0What's the **difference**, if I hook\u00a0up \"lightingControlGroups_\" or not,\u00a0as shown in the RED arrowhead in the attached file?\u00a0(Because the results are different as well)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/18H-groRyDQnNjKpWaeluyU--wVM7jArgC4TtwhY4PGzgtX8igCpq7C-r*q8UzZQvW9qHKwDyqkl-aTjk8snALftq8j1E7am/QQ20160304013136.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/18H-groRyDQnNjKpWaeluyU--wVM7jArgC4TtwhY4PGzgtX8igCpq7C-r*q8UzZQvW9qHKwDyqkl-aTjk8snALftq8j1E7am/QQ20160304013136.png)\n\n\n\n3) **If I have a large space (like a 40m*70m sports hall) and want to know its annual\u00a0lightingControlProfiles, do I need a \"lightingControl\" component to be hooked on to the \"readAnnualResultsI\" (in order to calculate its annual\u00a0lightingControlProfiles)?**\n\n**If needed, how many \"testPoints\"\u00a0I should choose to be used as \"sensorPoints_\" in the\u00a0\"lightingControl\" component?**\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your kind help!\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1477317", "name": "lighting_control_groups_msr_ding.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "March 04, 2016 at 03:16AM", "created_by": "doudou", "topic": "Lighting Control Group issue - 2", "id": "topic_1477318"}
