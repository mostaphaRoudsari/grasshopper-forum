{"body": "\nAfter I Installed energyplus v8-3-0, honeybee still warns that i have to have energyplus v8-1-0. I couldn't find the earlier version for it.\u00a0\n\nShould I install exactly the version 8-1-0 to make it function?\n\nI think honeybee cannot recognize the newer version of energyplus.\u00a0\n\nI've tried to change the name of the folder to \"8-1-0\". It generated some problems.\n\nNeed solutions.\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Xinyi Wu", "created_at": "October 07, 2015 at 06:36PM", "created_by": "XinyiWu", "topic": "Honeybee cannot find energyplus v8-3-0", "id": "topic_1375219"}
