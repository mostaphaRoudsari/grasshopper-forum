{"body": "\nHi Youngjae,\n\nAll sounds fair. We need to have a CFD component in the package and we tried once. I teamed up with EFRI-Pulse project ([http://www.buildsci.us/efri-pulse.html](http://www.buildsci.us/efri-pulse.html))\u00a0while ago and developed a connection to OpenFoam. We made a prototype that is works but the project is on hold for reasons which are out of my hand and I am the most frustrated person not having it out for use. Search for \"Butterfly\" and you will find some related stuff.\n\nThere are also other cases that may happen soon. Years ago, I wrote a connection to Ansys Fluent which I will share with Cayote\u00a0project\u00a0([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/coyote](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/coyote)). Ansys Fluent is pretty expensive though and I personally never had the chance to use it once I left the school!\n\nOther option is CoolVent ([http://coolvent.mit.edu/](http://coolvent.mit.edu/)), and we briefly had some conversations on getting it connected to the package but we already have so much on the list before getting there.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 15, 2014 at 10:28PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1185836", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1188788"}
