{"body": "\nPhew! \u00a0Not a major bug. \u00a0Just a small one that has been there since the component was first written. \u00a0You used a \":\" in the name of your zone and the CSV file uses \":\" to separate\u00a0the name of the zones from the type of output. \u00a0So having an extra \":\" in there messes it all up.\n\nThis is a really tough thing to fix right now so I will get to it at some later point. \u00a0For now, it's generally not a good idea to put special characters into the names of your zones or surfaces. \u00a0In the future, I think we will put in a bunch of checks in the future that remove these from any custom name that someone chooses.\n\nA fixed file is attached.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1217262", "name": "Occupancy_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 4, 2015 at 10:33am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1217249", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1217261"}
