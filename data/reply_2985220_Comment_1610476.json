{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nI know that there is a very small difference between how the two components write out the ideal air system. \u00a0Specifically, the E+ component uses a template system that is easy to add to the model but harder to size correctly. \u00a0The OpenStudio component writes out a full Ideal Air system that has more detail and is sized more robustly to handle the loads in extreme times. \u00a0It is possible that this may account for the difference.\n\nIs this a simulation that you are running with the ideal air system?\n\nIf not, I don't know of any other major differences between the two except that the OpenStudio component has an implementation of daylight controls that shouldn't affect anything since it is turned off by default. \u00a0In this case of not having an ideal air system, upload the gh file (no matter how large) and we will get to the bottom of the difference.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 4, 2016 at 6:56am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1610007", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1610476"}
