{"body": "\nHello,\n\nQuick question:\n\nPer image attached, what is wrong with the output colors appearance?\u00a0\n\nI am new (very new \u2014first post) to GH &amp; LB, already in love though...so thank you all for your hard work on these amazing tools!\n\nIn more words, for some reason the image generated is producing a textured surface and gradient. Grid is set to 4 (meters) so it should not be the reason, any idea...perhaps something in rhino options I need to change...I am not sure.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBig Thanks!![<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/PyPlrJLAwZdiCVnoGqNpmpmsIYvHutI6Xxkgdx9F3PovW4UausLSrbeCOrVDBnqOhAtSkJCFVdcSDkAhvMC2K16Fz7jMZgEV/sunlighthours.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/PyPlrJLAwZdiCVnoGqNpmpmsIYvHutI6Xxkgdx9F3PovW4UausLSrbeCOrVDBnqOhAtSkJCFVdcSDkAhvMC2K16Fz7jMZgEV/sunlighthours.JPG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nat Valdes", "created_at": "April 24, 2017 at 12:20pm", "created_by": "NatValdes", "topic": "Sunlight analysis output appearance", "id": "topic_1738906"}
