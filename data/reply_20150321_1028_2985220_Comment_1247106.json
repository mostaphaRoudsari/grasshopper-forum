{"body": "Hi Abraham,\nI don't know how I missed that, no air condition no cooling loads... duh! anyways, thanks for the help. I agree that it's better to divide the building into multiple zones. I'm going to create 6 zones for this building.\nOh, by the way thanks for the tip about fixing the components that turn orange (w/warning) it saved me a lot of time. For some reason whenever I close the file and re-open it some components give me warning, so I tried your suggestion, it works great.\n\nRania", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "March 21, 2015 at 10:28AM", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1246216", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1247106"}
