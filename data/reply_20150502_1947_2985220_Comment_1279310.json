{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nYour assumptions are correct. \u00a0This is the component that you should use to set up fan ventilation in an unconditioned warehouse. You will see an openingAreaFractionalSchedule on the Nat Vent / Air Flow component and you can use this to set the fraction of fan power that you want applied at each hour (if you use the CSV schedule component to make a schedule for the fan). \u00a0You can also just use the more common situation of having the fans turn on when the indoor temperature rises above a certain minIndoorTempforNatVent.\n\nIf the zones are unconditioned, the only airflow going into the zone infiltration, which is usually very small by default (just the air that flows through small cracks in the walls). \u00a0So your default unconditioned zones will probably overheat a lot.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 02, 2015 at 07:47PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279062", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279310"}
