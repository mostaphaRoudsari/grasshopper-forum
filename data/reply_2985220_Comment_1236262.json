{"body": "\nThanks for you reply Mostapha.\n\n\n\nI have my doubts regarding the first approach, I can't figure out a good way to input glazing geometries to the\u00a0Solve Adjacencies component (SA). I can add the exterior walls with glazing to it by using the wall and window geometry and AddHBGlz component, but the SA doesn't seem to understand the inputs (duplicated exterior walls etc.). As mentioned earlier it should be possible to solve this by\u00a0decomposing the zones, adding glazing to the walls and finally turn the HBSurfaces into HBZones again but it seems like a very complicated solution.\n\nIt would be really great if there was a way to add window geometries to the Solve Adjacencies component!\n\n\n\nAs for the second approach I must admit that I don't fully understand data management in Grasshopper. Anyways, I tried to graft the data but the result is the same, see the attached image. But you're saying that it should be possible to feed breakUpDist_ with a list of values?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1236264", "name": "HB glazing brake up distance as list grafted.png"}], "created_by_name": "Sverker Dahlblom", "created_at": "March 4, 2015 at 6:38am", "created_by": "SverkerDahlblom", "parent_id": "topic_1236000", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1236262"}
