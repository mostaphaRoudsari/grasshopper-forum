{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI am getting an error with the selectSkyMtx component when inputting large arrays of HOY inputs. See attached file.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe error says \"**1. Solution exception:unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'str' and 'int'**\".\n\nIt occurs on lines 42 and 141, where the HOY seems to be calculated and called. The error only appears when I have at least 1000 HOY\u00a0inputs or so. The data seems to be good, but I can't reasonably check every data set to be sure. I would feel more comfotable if I knew what was causing the error. I just can't figure this one out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy goal is to combine many hourly sky domes into a single cumulative dome that\u00a0responds to\u00a0complex occupancy schedules or heating/cooling\u00a0schedules. The analysis period does not\u00a0allow this level of refinement.\u00a0Is there a better way to accomplish\u00a0what I want\u00a0using standard Ladybug components?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you in advance for your help.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A974983", "name": "Ladybug test.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A974984", "name": "USA_MO_St.Louis-Lambert.Intl.AP.724340_TMY3.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "December 17, 2013 at 02:58PM", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "topic": "selectSkyMtx HOY error", "id": "topic_974985"}
