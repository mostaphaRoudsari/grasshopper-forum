{"body": "\nJoel,\n\nWhen you specify a centralized HVAC system like VAV, the electric and fuel energy is consumed at the plant (or the central boiler / chiller) and not at the zone. If you specify a system where energy is consumed at the zone-level like Packaged Terminal Heat Pumps (PTHP) or ideal air loads systems, you get a different energy consumption for each zone.\n\nIf you really need a sense of how much each zone is consuming with a VAV system, I could build the capability to get zone-level sensible and latent heating/cooling and output it from the Honeybee-Read EP HVAC Result component.\u00a0 However, it has to be clear to everyone that this energy is not electricity or fuel but just \"the amount of heat added to or removed from the zone.\"\u00a0 In other words, adding up all of the cooling energy of the zones is not going to be equal to the electric energy consumed by the chiller.\n\nLet me know if this makes sense and whether you would use the zone sensible/latent capability if I built it in.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 11, 2016 at 12:01pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1481570", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1482291"}
