{"body": "\nHi there,\n\n\n\nI've developed a little nifty way of calculating ASE hour per hour according to LEEDv4, however with just 350 points, it results in 350*8760 = ~3 million values.\n\n\n\nI have to branch these in the right way and then check whether they are larger than, lets say, 1000 lux.\n\n\n\nIn GH this process is a rather heavy calculation and I feel the program responding slowly when the calculation has been done, as its remembering the \"in between\" calculations, rather than only the end result.\n\n\n\nIs there any way through scripting, these statistics can be made without using much ram and causing GH to lag? Also, can statistics like this be enhanced through parallel processing?\n\n\n\nThese are the results of a fairly small simulation.\n\n\n\nOn a side note; I am aware that the current sky for ASE calculation tends to cause too high values in the results as the sky patches are rather rough instead of precise sun position. But I've heard that you guys might still be working on that?<br/><br/>\n\nAll the best, Mathias.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1667722", "name": "thresholds.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Mathias s n", "created_at": "January 06, 2017 at 02:49AM", "created_by": "Mathiassn", "topic": "ASE statistics with as little computer power as possible", "id": "topic_1667723"}
