{"body": "\nJust to make Chris comment on ENVImet, it doesn't work on pixels but with grids. The free license allows 100*100*30. The size range for the grid can be from 0.5 to 10 mts.\n\nENVImet is also time consuming ...\n\n\n\nMay i ask here, what are the compromises you can allow from the Energy point of view if you are interested only in the external microclimate? Maybe instead of multiple zones per floor, per building, define only one zone per floor?\n\nMaybe a wish for the future, input external wall temperatures from data, instead of calculating the whole energy model?\n\nMakes sense?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 9, 2017 at 8:23am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1748362", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1748383"}
