{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nThose are all very good points and you are right that my use of the term\"pixel world\" was very unscientific. \u00a0\"3D\" grid is much more appropriate. \u00a0All of those methods for simplifying the model are good ones. \u00a0The super-zone idea is actually probably good enough for most outdoor comfort situations but you likely want to assign internal loads that sum to the total internal heat gain over the number of floors of the building.\n\nOn a side note, you can actually plug in custom surface temperature data into the microclimate maps and I have done it before using surface temperatures that I measured form an experiment. \u00a0You just need to label all of your HBSrfs and coordinate that labeling with headers that you put on the custom data.\n\nAris,\n\nAre you saying that you were not able to run the GH file that you uploaded here and get the same results as I did? \u00a0If so, maybe there's an error on your machine and we can try to investigate further.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 6:50am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1748920", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749122"}
