{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nThere are many warnings in the simulation error file about surface orientation issue:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UvkuBgtWUIxtaACvSkUyA5AoOWkDKIWyniX*NgtP*UGKePx8R3GU5003aNM3aAJRcSBwc1kqepKE*bvw9gXCJX2siJkW7Y7K/Image6.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UvkuBgtWUIxtaACvSkUyA5AoOWkDKIWyniX*NgtP*UGKePx8R3GU5003aNM3aAJRcSBwc1kqepKE*bvw9gXCJX2siJkW7Y7K/Image6.png)\n\n\n\nIt seems the ground floor surface is identified as **underground ceiling surface** which doesn't seem to be reasonable. It should be **ground floor** surface if the building is sitting on the ground.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UvkuBgtWUIxLQcpJjqkNQ3Jq8xo8saeykqKFt0pcyjLHgSnu1IuluYj2O1a2KgrywCtEW4miNr1mGP1ygYWNADuRFiEjc2eH/Image5.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UvkuBgtWUIxLQcpJjqkNQ3Jq8xo8saeykqKFt0pcyjLHgSnu1IuluYj2O1a2KgrywCtEW4miNr1mGP1ygYWNADuRFiEjc2eH/Image5.png)\n\n\n\nI'd suggest you to check the geometry of the building and make sure the surface orientation is correct. You may also want to check if your building is positioned below the ground plan which by default is the xy plane in Rhino. Surface below the xy plane might be recognized by EnergyPlus as underground surface.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "June 28, 2017 at 03:39AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1775617", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1775555"}
