{"body": "\nThank you Devang for the suggestion and Chris for the clarification. Actually I solved, or better say I walked around, the issue in a bit tricky way, I created a loop that at each iteration is feeding the\u00a0Ladybug_Sunlight Hours Analysis component with a different object variation and I am saving the results in a single list with a different branch for every iteration. So yes very tricky.\n\n@ Chris Actually what I knew is that if you want an object to be a\u00a0geometry and context at the same time you had to input it in both inputs, so this made me think that an object only in the geometry input would not act like context for another object in geometry. Maybe these information are from when LB was less than 6 months old but cannot say.\u00a0\n\nThank you very much for the suggestion about grafting, actually sounds very logical but also this point \"brakes\" another belief I had about\u00a0Ladybug_Sunlight Hours Analysis. I understood that it was not possible at all graft the input of geometry, even if I never investigated why, or the component would have not worked properly (this is why it come with the input flattened by default).\n\nOk then, I will give a try grafting the input geometry.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "January 12, 2017 at 08:57AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "topic_1669294", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1670931"}
