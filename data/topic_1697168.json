{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI am trying to simulate the mean radiant temperatures on the roof of a house in suburban San Antonio, Texas. The goal is to assess the benefits of changing the roof materials to white ones in therms of temperature reduction and energy consumption. I have been working with the attached definitions with the great help of a friend, but I am quite new to ladybug and honeybee.\n\n\n\nI am not trusting the results I am getting. Can someone please help me just to check if I am doing something wrong?.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nArturo\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1697166", "name": "SANANTONIOBLDNGS.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1697167", "name": "microclimateSanAntonio20-02.gh"}], "created_by_name": "LUIS ARTURO REYES VALENCIA", "created_at": "February 21, 2017 at 2:48pm", "created_by": "LUISARTUROREYESVALENCIA", "topic": "Microclimate analisis on roof", "id": "topic_1697168"}
