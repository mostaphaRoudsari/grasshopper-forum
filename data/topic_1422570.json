{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI want to access the pathnames for the radiance (usually c:\\radiance) and energyplus installation.The goal is to test the availability of certain binary files like rcontrib, rmtxop etc. through simple assertions.\n\nIs it possible to access these details through scriptcontext.sticky or something similar ? I tried iterating through the sticky list but could not find anything.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "December 16, 2015 at 12:41pm", "created_by": "sarith", "topic": "Are the pathnames for radiance and energyplus folders available after Honeybee_Honeybee instantiation ?", "id": "topic_1422570"}
