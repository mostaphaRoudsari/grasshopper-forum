{"body": "\nOK. I need to be fair and say that i never will suspect the data of the EPW.\n\nFollowing\u00a0[this other thread](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-can-t-get-radiation-annual-grid-based-calculations-plotted?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1376484&amp;xg_source=msg_com_gr_forum) i opened, i restarted from fresh the loading of the EPW. I've found that the file i was using has 0 Global Horizontal Radiation. I don't know how thisd can happen. Now i'm using an alternative file and the results make MUCH more sense now.\n\nThis leads again to the saying: Garbage in, garbage out. Always check your results and don't say that they shoulb be right because the computer says so.\n\nSo, from my point of view i can close this issue.\n\nThanks Mostapha and sorry for the bothering.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 9, 2015 at 10:59pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1376203", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1376711"}
