{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI believe you are going to kill me, but i think there is something i'm missing.\n\nSee attached.\n\nI was using the HB_HB from 27.12 and it is not working with that one (with the message i wrote above).\n\nI've just update the HB_HB to the one from today 2.1.2015 and the problem is not solved. Worst than that, the HB_runEnergySimulation is complaining about \"1. Solution exception:List\". This is the version from 15.9. The newer one is not working, as i reported separately.\n\nBTW, in the attached you can swith from one version of HB_HB to the other. With the \"oldest\" one you get through the simulation but can't get the surface results.\n\nSo what am i missing?\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1197932", "name": "MySimulation_AY_MSR.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 03, 2015 at 01:35AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1197701", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1197931"}
