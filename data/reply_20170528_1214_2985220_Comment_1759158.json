{"body": "\nI really don't understand your worries.\n\nFirst for all the radiationAnalysis component uses the selectSkyMtx which uses the Global Radiation (unless you ask to remove direct or diffuse).\n\nSecond, i've made some tests, and the results are pretty much consistent to your expectations (December the highest, June the lowest). But i also get a case where the 21.6 at some hours is higher than 21.3, so i changed the day (as i wrote previously) to the 30.3 and then the results are fine (they were fine also before, but just for your peace of mind).\n\nAttached the file i worked on. I plotted a 3dChart also so you can see the differences in the data through the year.\n\nSee red arrow to see the changed day.\n\nHope this makes sense for you now.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1759159", "name": "RadiationAnalysis_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 28, 2017 at 12:14PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1759066", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1759158"}
