{"body": "\nPablo,\n\nI do not think that I fully understand your question but I can say that the construction library in the\u00a0userCustomEPLibrary.idf is separate from the project library that is created when you write a material/construction into the library with the \"AddToEPLibrary\" component. \u00a0The latter is just written to the computer memory of the Grasshopper file and is deleted as soon as you close the GH file. \u00a0Not sure if this helps. \u00a0I don't know what you mean by \"locally\"\n\nWhat are you writing in to the\u00a0userCustomEPLibrary.idf? \u00a0Perhaps it is not the right format. \u00a0Can you upload your userCustomEPLibrary.idf\u00a0file?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 10, 2015 at 5:15pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1237648", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240234"}
