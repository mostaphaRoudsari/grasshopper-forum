{"body": "\nThere was a couple of issues in your file:\n\n\n\n1. The major problem was that the input geometries were open. You needed to add the surfaces around the inlet and outlet to the model.\n\n\n\n2. locationInMesh was not set. Butterfly sets the locationInMesh by default to the center of the case which in this case was outside the volume.\n\n\n\nYou also need to create a much denser mesh. In cases like your case you can add layers to surfaces for snappyHexMesh. I attached a modified version of your file which runs but didn't play with the quality of the mesh.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/T58XxRjt3cSOlWVLi6L2fYOfciHtwNLTHJ8LbRvxIi2kKoXTu4GujCAKLZQvrfcXgaZWs9bfPZ0BdFHAoxTXo*wmWItIUHT8/open_geometry.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/T58XxRjt3cSOlWVLi6L2fYOfciHtwNLTHJ8LbRvxIi2kKoXTu4GujCAKLZQvrfcXgaZWs9bfPZ0BdFHAoxTXo*wmWItIUHT8/open_geometry.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1720819", "name": "cfd_Curve02.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 25, 2017 at 1:55pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1717681", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1720818"}
