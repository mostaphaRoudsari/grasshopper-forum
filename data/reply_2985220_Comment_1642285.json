{"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\n\n\nGreat thanks for your patient and detailed work! And deeply sorry for my late reply.\n\n\n\nAs you said, the errors happened in the setting of air wall and glazing ratio. I cheked your uploaded gh file, excellent work! Thank you so much.\n\n\n\nI also think whether the volume setting method could work better than the surface setting method, which could simplify the model with reduced possibilities of errors, what do you think?\n\n\n\nWhat's your final result of 50 generations? What I saw is the errors decreased, at the same time, the calculation could not stop at the 50th generation unless I pressed the stop bottom. Hmm, interesting. How about yours? Maybe there could exist no best value setting of lowest energy consumption? Or should we set a threshold at first?\n\n\n\nXiaojian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "November 19, 2016 at 9:25am", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1641360", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1642285"}
