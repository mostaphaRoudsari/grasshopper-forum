{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nSorry for not responding sooner. \u00a0By default, the adaptive model used in Ladybug is always going to be the most-recent official ASHRAE standard (currently\u00a0ASHRAE 55 2013), which is this one:\n\ntComf = 0.31 * runningMean + 17.8\n\nYou can see this is true by looking in the Javascript source code of the CBE Comfort Tool ([http://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/](http://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/)) and specifically at the formula in their ASHRAE comfort model (source code for the comfort models can be found here:\u00a0[http://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/static/js/comfortmodels.js](http://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/static/js/comfortmodels.js))\n\n\n\nThe first formula that you posted there seems to be an older one that was probably released as the first-ever Adaptive standard and was later revised (since the first ASHRAE adaptive model was released in 1999/2000). \u00a0It is likely that this older one was developed with fewer studies than the currently-adopted one. \u00a0Still, it is worth noting that this first formula is fairly close to the correlation used in the European standard (EN-15251)\n\ntComf = 0.33 * runningMean + 18.8\n\nI am currently working in the ability to use the European standard in LB so that we have all parties represented.\n\n\n\nSo, in summary, it's important to keep in mind that there's quite a bit of \"wiggle-room\" around these correlations. \u00a0As long as you get the general trend correct, you should be able to produce good passive designs You really only need a dead-accurate formula if you are showing compliance at the end of a design process.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 4, 2015 at 1:30pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1320235", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1320417"}
