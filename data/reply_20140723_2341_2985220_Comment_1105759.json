{"body": "\nHi Ander,\n\nJust checked the file. This is a bug in the new Class that I wrote in Honeybee. It will happen for any planar surface which have non-rectangular glazing. I will try to get it fixed now but it may take longer. I will upload the new version once I figure it out. Thank you for reporting this.\n\n-Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 23, 2014 at 11:41PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1105036", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1105759"}
