{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you for taking your time to reply(and also thanks for the other clarification \u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/help-no-eio...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/help-no-eio-file-error?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1295920&amp;xg_source=msg_com_gr_forum) couldn't reply there).I really appreciate both yours and Abraham's help.\n\n\n\nI think I should change the workflow than if you say that the component has bugs.First find the form for max solar radiation without openings (to benefit from the passive design, solar gains). next planarize somehow the geometrical outcome, and than run the optimization again this time with \u00a0for max daylighting and min total energy use plus cooling.\n\n\n\nDo you think this \u00a0workflow make sense ?\n\nThanks,\n\nN\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nit\u00eb", "created_at": "June 1, 2015 at 10:12am", "created_by": "Nita", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1295882", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1300676"}
