{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for pointing out the **absence of common sense** in my observation of the results :)\n\n\n\nHowever, it still begs the question that why the **annual total net purchased energy** (258kWh) is not equal to **annual total electricity demand** (4717kWh) minus **annual total energy generated on site through PV** (4504kWh), i.e 213kWh.\n\n\n\nOr is the net purchased energy is calculated in different way?\n\n\n\nAppreciate you kind advice.\u00a0\n\n<br/>Thank you!\n\n- Ji\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 28, 2016 at 08:58PM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1589699", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1589946"}
