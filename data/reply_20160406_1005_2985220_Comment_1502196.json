{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for your quick answer !\n\n\n\nThe program I have to develop must provides hourly values of solar energy (diffuse and direct incident and transmitted) and takes into account multiple transmissions and reflexions of diffuse and direct solar radiations. The tool must be adapted for the study of any atypical facade configuration (in terms of material and geometry).\n\n\n\nI am not sure to know how to use EnergyPlus HB components.\n\nIt is possible to define analysis grids ? because it could be interesting to have the solar energy reached on a particular point for instance.\u00a0\n\nDoes EnergyPlus use the \"Ray-Tracing\" method to calculate the solar energy ? I think this method is really adapted for my problematic.\n\nEnergyPlus seem to suit more for global energy simulation.. (?)\n\n\n\nIf I use my program to determine the \"solar factor\" of the shading system only (opaque material), Do the results take into account the multiple reflexions of the rays when they are launched ? (At last the reflexion..)\n\n\n\nFor a moment, I though to convert R G B radiances calculated to solar energy but couldn't find some works on that possibility. like \"daylight simulation\" but transposed to solar energy...\n\n\n\nI'm trying to be clear about my problematic, let me know if I am not.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAmbitious work,\n\nThanks in advance for your help !\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Severine", "created_at": "April 06, 2016 at 10:05AM", "created_by": "Severine", "parent_id": "topic_1502227", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1502196"}
