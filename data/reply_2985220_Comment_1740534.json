{"body": "\nStill don't get why you need the intersect mass. Your case doesn't allow intersection. At most, face overlapping. That's why what i sent works fine.\n\nAnyway, i was curious of your comment, and started testing if it has to do with tolerance units ... it is not. The thing is that when i open your file the intersectMass is ok. But when i move the seed slider it always turn orange. Even for the original seed. But the most interesting thing is that if i recompute the file it works fine for all cases. From this i have the suspicion that something remains in memory, from previous checkings, that needs to be cleaned. The error/warning is the one in line 257 (if Hzones == True).\n\nHere probably Chris will have a more educated answer.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 26, 2017 at 9:47pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1740439", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1740534"}
