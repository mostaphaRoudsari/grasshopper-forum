{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Dimitrios,\n\nI Am using the VSC Compoment and i think this is really great compared to other tool i've been using for calculating it.\n\nI just have a question about the results, Usually the maximum VSC value you can get is 40% while if I use a simulation Radiance based I am reaching values which are around \u00a045%, and generally figure are higher than the same model calculated let's say with Ecotect.\n\nI was wondering why is that happening, probably it has to deal with indirect reflections?\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1226216", "name": "vsc.png"}], "created_by_name": "amedeo scofone", "created_at": "February 17, 2015 at 04:55AM", "created_by": "amedeoscofone", "parent_id": "topic_811691", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1226214"}
