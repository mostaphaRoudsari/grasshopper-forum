{"body": "\nAbdulrhman,\n\nThank you for the useful post!\n\nI am trying to get this process to work for me as well (it seems all of the new augmented reality tools require everything to be in 3DSMax).\u00a0 For some reason, the mesh seems to be importing with some discoloration for some of the vertices:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/WN6fyIjTzRi-ciPalAmn818Pnifr6SCRv1TUE7wQUxnrzqR7dQ*iPhQKzDNu*wlH4NcEnsgpbcLVuuIXh1AJVF3sKzLKAijg/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/WN6fyIjTzRi-ciPalAmn818Pnifr6SCRv1TUE7wQUxnrzqR7dQ*iPhQKzDNu*wlH4NcEnsgpbcLVuuIXh1AJVF3sKzLKAijg/Capture.JPG)My guess is that it might have something to do with the way that the mesh is structured.\n\n\n\nIf you get the chance, would you mind posting the mesh that you were able to successfully send over to 3DSMax?\u00a0 If I can get this working on my machine, I can likely build in some code to make this process faster so that you would not need to use the rendervertexcolors.gh but just select a different integer option on bakeIt_.\n\nThanks again,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 09, 2016 at 10:09AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1475247", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1480508"}
