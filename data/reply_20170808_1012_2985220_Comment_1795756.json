{"body": "Ludvig,\n\nI haven't gotten the chance to check your definition yet but I can say that Honeybee runs simulations in parallel in a fairly \"hacky\" way. It simply takes some of the points and runs a simulation on one core and takes another set of points and runs another simulation on another core. Then honeybee tries to take all of those separate simulation results and stitches them back together into one set of results.\n\nIt seems that this error is the result of something going wrong in the last part (stitching the results together in the right order). I'll try to take a look at it at some point. But for now, you might try using the daylight lookup folder and see sorry the result files to get them in the right order and then import them.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 08, 2017 at 10:12AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1795733", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1795756"}
