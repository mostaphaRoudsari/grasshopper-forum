{"body": "\nHi guys!\n\nI have a problem running Honeybee.\u00a0\n\nAfter running Ladybug_UpdateThisFile, HoneyBee_Simulation Controls component updated to May 02 2015 version and stopped working.\n\nThe component is red and gives me this error: \"1. Solution exception:global name 'maxWarmupDays_' is not defined\"\n\nIf I go back to the previous version, it does not work (I mean, it does not change the controls in the final idf file).\n\n\n\nthank you very much\n\nLetizia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Letizia Martinelli", "created_at": "May 21, 2015 at 08:14AM", "created_by": "LetiziaMartinelli", "topic": "problem simControls honeybee May Update", "id": "topic_1291536"}
