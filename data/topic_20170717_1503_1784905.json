{"body": "\nHi, I am sorry but I am coming to trouble you again.<br/>I was trying to overlay comfort percentage onto zones. I tried to use floor mesh as input_mesh, however, it seems ladybug generated diagram on every meshes\u00a0with individual legends. In addition, several meshes were missing. I tried to use Color Zones with EP Results, but comfort data was not zone data. Could you please help me?\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1784903", "name": "wrong.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1784904", "name": "Battery.png"}], "created_by_name": "Considering", "created_at": "July 17, 2017 at 03:03PM", "created_by": "Considering", "topic": "Overlay comfort percentage onto zones", "id": "topic_1784905"}
