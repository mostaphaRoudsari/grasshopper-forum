{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and group members,\n\n\n\nIs it possible to simplify the setting process of construction u-value with a series of u-value numbers rather than a range of detailed settings \u00a0in order to\u00a0accelerate the process of conceptual design process?\n\n\n\nBecause for the designers, especially architects in the conceptual stage, the u-value of constructions such as walls, roof and floor, and the u-value and SHGC of window may draw more attentions. And of course, we can make a range of constructions from **Honeybee_Call from EP Construction Library**, but the interval of constructions values seems discontinuous, not enough and also limited. And is it possible for designers to find the optimal u-value of constructions and then to develop the detailed construction settings such as wall's thickness, roughness? Could find a proper solution or workflow for this thought?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n\nXiaojian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "May 19, 2017 at 9:01pm", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "topic": "Simplify the setting process of u-value", "id": "topic_1754725"}
