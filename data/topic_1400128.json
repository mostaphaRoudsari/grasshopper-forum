{"body": "\nHi There!\n\n\n\nSince I updated HB/LB to the latest version I am having a problem. I am missing a lot of information in terms of the EP library including material and constructions. For example, I dont have the clear window material or the AIRWall construction. I believe I am doing things right in the scripts and cant find why. I am attaching an image. I believe that in theory I should be seeing more constructions right? Please help me and thank you for your time.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1400127", "name": "Capture.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Jose Holguin", "created_at": "November 13, 2015 at 2:53pm", "created_by": "JoseRafaelHolguin", "topic": "Missing EP Libraries/Constructions", "id": "topic_1400128"}
