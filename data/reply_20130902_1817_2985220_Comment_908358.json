{"body": "\nHi again Abraham,\n\n\n\nI checked the sunpath and the difference, as you mentioned,\u00a0is the difference between solar time and local time. As you can see in the image below if you provide longitude and time zone the difference between the result of Ladybug and your results is less then a degree.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ZXoWXLs1YKPnBjiaFbCa3TaISn0fHczAFKgVleajQMxgkFIfaCp15Zo0eZZscdzdInEm56Nqy7p3zLDCQ9Wg5e7zZNwSb863/sunPath_check.png?width=700\" width=\"700\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ZXoWXLs1YKPnBjiaFbCa3TaISn0fHczAFKgVleajQMxgkFIfaCp15Zo0eZZscdzdInEm56Nqy7p3zLDCQ9Wg5e7zZNwSb863/sunPath_check.png)\u00a0\n\nYour point about how people input the hour is fair. One option is to remove latitude, longitude, and timeZone inputs from the component and have the weather file as the input so the correction will be always applied. The only concern is in some cases you may want to draw the sunPath for locations that you don't have the weather file but you have the lat, lng, and time zone. Maybe we can have two sunpath components?\n\n\n\nThe other option is to add a component to convert solar time &lt;-&gt; local time and then use the solar time as the input. It might be confusing though.\n\n\n\nThanks again and let me know what do you think.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 02, 2013 at 06:17PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_906401", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_908358"}
