{"body": "\nHi djordje\u00a0and Chris,\n\n\n\nfirstly, thanks for the links and information. <br/>Djordje, I have modified Terrain Generator, I used an input like yours - radius - in this way should be easy to make a terrain model. However I just use rectangular surfaces.\n\nI have followed your advice about the surfaces, and after a couple of tests I saw that meshes should be better, especially when you have big differences of elevation within small zones.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hglJbwhHCCZtfjrhTGDfiHmsoA2BxUVC52lQtK5TYxU1uMlBfstPtDePSJJG*R-2cbjDjsUCxJf8Tv6lhGddrMr1yr-cYvHQ/NIAGARA.png?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hglJbwhHCCZtfjrhTGDfiHmsoA2BxUVC52lQtK5TYxU1uMlBfstPtDePSJJG*R-2cbjDjsUCxJf8Tv6lhGddrMr1yr-cYvHQ/NIAGARA.png)\n\nLB terrain generator is not fast but is accurate enough. I'll send a pull request for this new version soon.\n\n\n\nBest<br/>Antonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "August 30, 2016 at 11:36am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1590774", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1591064"}
