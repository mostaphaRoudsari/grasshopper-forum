{"body": "\nHi Francesco,\n\nSorry to get back to you late!\n\nBack to Energyplus and Radiance I'll probably ask users to download and install them manually. I really like the idea to let the users know what is really happening in the background. I believe the more you know about the workflow the smarter you'll use the tool.\n\nThank you for the comment. If you are extensively using the analysis components let me know and I'll send you a newer version for test which is much faster.\n\nThere are other resources that you can use.\u00a0Weather Analytics is one of the options\u00a0[http://www.weatheranalytics.com/weather-products/](http://www.weatheranalytics.com/weather-products/)\u00a0and White Box Technologies\u00a0[http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/weather_data.html](http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/weather_data.html)\u00a0is another one. I know that in some cases they provide it for free for educational use.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 6, 2013 at 5:28pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_864261", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_867429"}
