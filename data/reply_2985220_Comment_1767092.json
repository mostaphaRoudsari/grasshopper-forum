{"body": "\nHi Omar,\n\n\n\nThanks for getting back.\u00a0 Unfortunately that did not fix the problem.\u00a0 I\u00a0was already on\u00a0honeybee latest version 0.0.61.\u00a0 But I did run the update and swapped the daylight simulation component.\n\n\n\nHowever I have a copy of\u00a0that same Shadow study example\u00a0file\u00a0from version\u00a00.0.51 (this sample file is from before they uploaded\u00a0samples to\u00a0hydra).\u00a0 This file works fine and I am able to see the HDR image (although I don't like the quality).\n\n\n\nAny ideas why the old sample file works but not the new one?\u00a0 I have not made any change to either file, I just downloaded it and hit run.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ibby", "created_at": "June 9, 2017 at 9:59pm", "created_by": "Ibby", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1767087", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1767092"}
