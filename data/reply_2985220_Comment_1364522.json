{"body": "\nHi Elzine,\n\n\n\nSorry that no one has got back to you about solving your issue. I am trying to work out whats going wrong with your file now. Which components are giving you this error? Is it the Run Energy Plus simulation and the Honeybee Read EP result component? That is what I am getting.\n\n\n\nI am however having trouble with your building constructions. Simply some of them don't exist when I open your file on my machine. Since your work flow is so complicated and I'm having trouble with it can I suggest that you show me how your work flow is meant to work over Skype?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis would make it easier for me to work out whats going wrong. You can add my skype on - anton.szilasi\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "September 18, 2015 at 9:22am", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "topic_1361913", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1364522"}
