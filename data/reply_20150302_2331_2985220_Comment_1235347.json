{"body": "\nSorry Abraham,\n\n\n\nAttaching the file now.\n\n\n\nI managed to run the simulation, as I said it was an issue of the layers not being displayed (probably Rhino tolerance?). But after the simulation I got some very strange results. Glazing is shown as walls, walls and the glazing over it are shown in the results, certain walls with glazing are completely ignored, etc.\n\n\n\nI think this workflow, adding glazing one after another, is either wrong or doesn't work. I wish we could do it as the radiance workflow, adding surfaces by type :(\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1235349", "name": "Office_MultipleGlazing.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 02, 2015 at 11:31PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1235339", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1235347"}
