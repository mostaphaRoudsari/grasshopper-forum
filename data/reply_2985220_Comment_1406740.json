{"body": "\nMeeee,\n\nThat's an experimental layered drawing animation that I made for my thesis. \u00a0It was made using the thermal maps that I developed for my thesis as a start, which you can see a concise example here:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Microclimate_Map_-_Simple)\n\nNotably, I selected \"distFromFloorOrSrf\" surfaces that were close to the surfaces of the zone to give the appearance of a spatial thermal render. \u00a0Also, all of the energy simulations that were generating the thermal maps were of completely passive buildings (no HVAC system) so that you end up with a lot of thermal diversity across the space.\n\nI also layered in some daylight renderings from Radiance, some material textures in Photoshop, and some line drawing/ people silhouettes in Illustrator. \u00a0I eventually decided that this was a bit too much information to make a clear presentation for my thesis and so the rest of the animations that I produced were just line drawings with thermal renders and silhouettes of people:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-Sj3ehUTSfKa1IHPSiu...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-Sj3ehUTSfKa1IHPSiuJU52A)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 22, 2015 at 12:53pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1406573", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1406740"}
