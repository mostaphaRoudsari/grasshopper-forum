{"body": "\nHi Timothy,\n\n\n\nThank you for reporting this. I have seen this before but never really fixed it. It is half bad Karma ( how Radiance works) and half bad code!\n\nBack to the karma part it is about how Radiance works. It calculates the scene first and then it starts the ray-tracing process. Breaking down the points into subgroups is only helpful for the second part so in cases that calculating the scene can take a long time it won't be really helpful.\n\n\n\nBut in case only the last file takes much longer it is my fault for not writing a better distribution function. I assume the number of test points for the last CPU was bigger than the rest. I modified the code and if you update with github and try again hopefully it should give you a better performance overall.\n\n\n\nKeep me posted about the results.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 04, 2015 at 11:20AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1255660", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256337"}
