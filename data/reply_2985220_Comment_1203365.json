{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, thanks for the file!\n\nIn regards to your question, I\u00b4m interested on generating OS files from honeybee in order to setup a workflow where advanced mechanical systems could be incorporated (in OS or directly over the IDF), and where all the geometry could be directly handled in Rhino-Grass. Some weeks ago, I tried to create an emodel of considerable size using OS in Sketchup and after a little bit the geometry handling became pretty messy and unstable. The implementation of the workflow is geared towards research as well as energy auditing of existing buildings.\n\nBest!,\n\nAlejandro\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Gamas", "created_at": "January 12, 2015 at 10:10pm", "created_by": "AlejandroGamas", "parent_id": "topic_1201808", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1203365"}
