{"body": "\nLeland,\n\nI imagine that changing the addition of \"_Dup\" to the addition of unique guid would be generally helpful in light of this case. \u00a0If you upload a GH file where you are experiencing the problem, I will look into changing it. \u00a0As Mostapha said, best practice is to set zone names when you create them. \u00a0If either this \"_Dup\" check or a unique guid check is used, it messes up the matching of names that happens in my color zones and color surface components. \u00a0Having your GH file will allow me to ponder if there is some way around this.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 30, 2015 at 8:19pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1316648", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1318451"}
