{"body": "\nDear djordje.<br/> My\u00a0apologies\u00a0for not making the issue clear. Since I cannot reply to your last comment, I am commenting here.\u00a0\n\nJust to be sure I understand you correctly: when you mention the \"upper floor of the fa\u00e7ade geometries\", is this what you have in mind (check the attached photo)?<br/> <br/> I think I understand what was causing the confusion, and if you reply to my last question I will elaborate a bit more on the shading issue.\n\n\n\nWhat I meant about the upper floor geometry is that I was assuming that not only PV form upper floor, but also the other elements such as glazing, opaque panels, and external shading device.<br/> <br/> <br/> [<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/QXFoMJO9hw6VZrEWx74vFKeRVy0UEpOecjLUE9Q-R2ppDshZulNjCPkxgdMQIlQBusVEkzZZnmcEnndh*7ZOYM9lb8upAvBA/123.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/QXFoMJO9hw6VZrEWx74vFKeRVy0UEpOecjLUE9Q-R2ppDshZulNjCPkxgdMQIlQBusVEkzZZnmcEnndh*7ZOYM9lb8upAvBA/123.jpg)Here in the picture, you would understand what I am trying to explain verbally. The testing PV panel is one in the middle of 3 by 3 building facade.\u00a0<br/> The question is how to calculate the shadings from the other geometries, which are painted in brownish colour in the image.<br/><br/>Just in case if the image is not seen, please find it\u00a0[here](https://www.dropbox.com/sc/n8eto5c4ruh8maq/AADy2ou9sDwPzxiOaFZoCWFjahttps://www.dropbox.com/sc/n8eto5c4ruh8maq/AADy2ou9sDwPzxiOaFZoCWFja)<br/> <br/>\n\nHope its clear now.\u00a0<br/> <br/> Kind regards.<br/> Amaraa.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "May 28, 2016 at 02:58AM", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537910", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537876"}
