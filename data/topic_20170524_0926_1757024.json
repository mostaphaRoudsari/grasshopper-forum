{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am super new to the Honeybee tools and started using it specifically for the THERM integration. I so excited by its potential and have run a few tests.\n\nThe process works amazingly but there were discrepancies between the THEM output in Rhino and from THERM.\n\nI imported the THERM file created by HB into THERM to do some trouble shooting and found that the THERM file from HB uses an Automatic Enclosure model for the boundary condition radiation.\n\nOur calculations always use Blackbody for the exterior BC radiation model.\n\nI can see how to change everyother setting for the BC but not this.\n\nI have done some digging but cannot see where to change this, is this possible?\n\nThanks\n\nJonny\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1757023", "name": "BC setting.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Jonathan Story", "created_at": "May 24, 2017 at 09:26AM", "created_by": "JonathanStory", "topic": "THERM - Control over BC Radiation Model", "id": "topic_1757024"}
