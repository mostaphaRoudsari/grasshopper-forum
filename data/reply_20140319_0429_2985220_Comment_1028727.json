{"body": "\nDear Mostapha, thank you for your kind explanation.\u00a0\n\nI am a little bit confused now, and I would like to ask some more things:\n\nWhich sky is used by default for daylight analysis, and how can I influence this? I understand I can create multiple conditions of the sky (with or without the sun), but where I introduce it into, for example, annual daylight simulation? Also, as I understand, I can create sky for specific day and time of day, while annual simulation is running for the whole year, and after it's done I can extract specific condition for specific time and day as well. Should I create a series of 365 skies, each with 24 variation for this kind of simulation?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Petar Pejic", "created_at": "March 19, 2014 at 04:29AM", "created_by": "PetarPejic", "parent_id": "topic_1024838", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1028727"}
