{"body": "\nHey guys, I think this is a fantastic idea.\n\n\n\nI agree that html and github would probably be too difficult for the majority of the users, (although I personally really like github's sophistication, i.e: integration with code, search features).\n\n\n\nReiterating Benjamin's point: are you guys imagining this to be a straight-up wiki, or more of a community-oriented platform? If the latter, I think something like Ning:\u00a0[http://www.ning.com/](http://www.ning.com/) would be better than MediaWiki. You can see an example of its use here for UMI:\u00a0[http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/](http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/).\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe main advantage with Ning is that it has a lot more out-of-the-box features: including a dedicated forum and places to share projects and a place to store downloads. One possible disadvantage here is that a forum feature would be redundant with the LB/HB Grasshopper page and threads. Overall though, I think it's a \u00a0stronger community platform then MediaWiki. \u00a0\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "August 18, 2014 at 02:41PM", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "parent_id": "topic_1098315", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1117894"}
