{"body": "\nThank you for posting, Luciano.\n\nThis is very interesting stuff. \u00a0The error seems to be specifically with the CCWeatherGen tool since I was able to open the unaltered ITA Naples file without any issues:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-7oxPj1gJLk3SVBleZwg2krOpapXnVZnlK0ifmbGiynZzlkmyKEMmewXxZ*ew6gS3TgZ1mYLyPGMrkUZjeJ12gSClELeO12g/ITA_NAplesOK.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-7oxPj1gJLk3SVBleZwg2krOpapXnVZnlK0ifmbGiynZzlkmyKEMmewXxZ*ew6gS3TgZ1mYLyPGMrkUZjeJ12gSClELeO12g/ITA_NAplesOK.PNG)\n\nI have had it on my long-term agenda to consider making a Python version of the CCWeatherGen tool since the excel-based version that they have now can be so difficult to use sometimes. \u00a0This bug in the produced output seems be be another good reason for me to look into what it would take to move the whole thing over to Python. \u00a0I will let you know if I ever get around to this.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 6, 2014 at 12:38am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1180921", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182351"}
