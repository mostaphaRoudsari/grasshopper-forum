{"body": "Willy,\n\nThe simplest way to automate the generating/recording of results is to use the Ladybug \"Fly\" component to cycle through you combination of sliders and use the native GH \"record\" component to record the results as you cycle through. You can then copy the recorded results from a panel into an excel or csv. There are other workflows (ie. using components that write to excel), which others may comment on here.\n\nAt the moment, we don't have a component that automates everything for the design explorer format but I may add one soon unless someone beats me to it.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 30, 2016 at 06:17AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1648600", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1649140"}
