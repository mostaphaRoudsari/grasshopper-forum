{"body": "\nI'm not an expert in this topic and I assume there should be some research to calculate formulas for modeling such behavior, but if you want to create your own workflow then you can model such an effect by creating an energy model (to calculate the surface temperature), or use radiance (to calculate the radiation on the surface) and then use them as boundary condition for a CFD analysis where you can also model the airflow. Such a workflow won't work for an annual analysis though.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 15, 2017 at 4:05pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1671369", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1672488"}
