{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI added an Export to Openstudio component on my canvas. I got an error telling me to download the Csharp library from here: [https://app.box.com/s/y2sx16k98g1lfd3r47zi](https://app.box.com/s/y2sx16k98g1lfd3r47zi)\n\n\n\nFirst, if I may make a suggestion:\n\n1. I would add these steps to the [installation instructions](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/resources/Installation_Instructions.txt)\n\n2. I would double quote the path, I got confused by whether I should include the \"_\" at the end of the path (%appdata%\\Ladybug\\OpenStudio_).\n\n\n\nAnyway, I downloaded the libraries, and pasted all the dll to the OpenStudio_ folder needed.\n\nBut it throws an exception on line 67:\n\nRuntime error (IOException): file does not exist: C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\\OpenStudio_\\openStudio.dll<br/> Traceback:<br/> \u00a0 line 67, in script<br/>\n\nOne thing is that the box link for the libraries give you a zip that does include a dll that looks very similar... except it's cased differently: it is Upper Camel Case (OpenStudio.dll) and not Lower Camel Case (openStudio.dll)\n\n\n\nAnother thing is that even once I have renamed the above dll to match the casing, I still get this exception, even though os.path.isfile(os.path.join(openStudioLibFolder, \"openStudio.dll\")) returns True.\n\nIf I type the path on the run command it does land at the appropriate file...\n\n\n\nI'm confused, any ideas?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/MoQW6swxykUD6HkvHWMuviLO8oNmXqr4Mb8WvMDsDov996QDA9IAqckojA3mgB5gOED8RluOjYY1y44gsLLBMimtWccug9PJ/2015032305_58_07OpenStudio_.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/MoQW6swxykUD6HkvHWMuviLO8oNmXqr4Mb8WvMDsDov996QDA9IAqckojA3mgB5gOED8RluOjYY1y44gsLLBMimtWccug9PJ/2015032305_58_07OpenStudio_.jpg)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1248092", "name": "2015-03-23 05_58_07-OpenStudio_.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Julien Marrec", "created_at": "March 23, 2015 at 4:01am", "created_by": "JulienMarrec", "topic": "Honeybee and Openstudio dll problem", "id": "topic_1248093"}
