{"body": "\nNick,\n\nGlad that you find the definition useful. \u00a0I am going to update the components on that hydra shortly so that it's not using the components from a year ago.\n\nGetting the energy model geometry correct often takes me longer than the setting up the components these days so I can definitely relate.\n\nThe question you ask about BlockBeamSolar is a good one. \u00a0There are actually a lot of little parameters for shading that I did not expose on the shade component mostly because it is already so big. \u00a0I would say that there's still room for a few more if people would find them useful. \u00a0If you start a github issue for it, I will get to it eventually.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 11, 2016 at 4:02pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579066", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1580441"}
