{"body": "\nHello everyone!\n\n\n\nI am considering setting up a small research project which will focus on developing components useful for environmental analysis, always closely related to the built environment and most of the times in internal building performance.\n\n\n\nI was wondering if I could brainstorm with you on what would be useful or needed at the time.\n\n\n\nI would love to develop these as a complement to Ladybug/Honeybee as well, but given the tools are so highly developed at the moment it was hard for me to find a direction that would prove useful.\n\n\n\nAny ideas would be very welcome!\n\n\n\nMostapha/Chris, if something like that started would it be possible to have a cooperation on testing and/or developing within LB/HB?\n\n\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "July 15, 2015 at 9:05am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Research Project Ideas!", "id": "topic_1326279"}
