{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nYou had been assigning the U-Factor tags correctly and I have added in a message on the thermBC component that lets you know that this is happening. \u00a0The reason why all the tags were not showing up is that the glass polygon needs to have vertices that align with the endpoints of the therm BC line segments in order to be written into the thmx file. \u00a0You can see that I have done this in the attached file by generating the glass thermPolygon from a polyline that has vertices that align with the thermBC endpoints.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Fxq0VavCSuBZ38ev1gqnQLF1UgtdBhY87mkiKHsGFh6qr0mNROq73KdWJZa5WcqpWp8vTCB7w6SX41ayrB-SYS0*O3TyOjmN/AllUFactorTags.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Fxq0VavCSuBZ38ev1gqnQLF1UgtdBhY87mkiKHsGFh6qr0mNROq73KdWJZa5WcqpWp8vTCB7w6SX41ayrB-SYS0*O3TyOjmN/AllUFactorTags.JPG)\n\nI had been thinking of writing a check in the writeTHERM component to automatically split the polygons using the BCs when it sees that the BCs are not aligned with the polygons but it was increasing the calculation time a lot. \u00a0Perhaps I'll put this in but I'll make it optional.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1672695", "name": "ThermSection_CWM2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 16, 2017 at 6:21am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1671793", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1672694"}
