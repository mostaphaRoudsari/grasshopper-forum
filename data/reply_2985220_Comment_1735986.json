{"body": "\nDecomposition happens from the decomposepar component, which breaks the case to multiple pieces and sends each piece to each core/processor. In you case, the error seems to suggest that the decomposition wasn't done or hadn't been done before you run the case.\n\n\n\nI will take a look at your file in a bit and let you know what I find.\n\n\n\nEdit: I just realized that you have a complex ground surface. This is usually problematic but can be handled with. A usual problem is that the area below the landscape (if it's closed properly) is not included in the mesh as it is outside of the locationInMesh region. However, the inlet, outlet, and sides usually span above and below the geometry. I feel that if you open the meshed case in paraview you would see an inlet, outlet, and side geometries that go below your landscape. I can confirm once i open the file.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 19, 2017 at 6:28pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1736140", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1735986"}
