{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nAnother one for 2015 ... sorry.\n\nConnecting the readEPSurfaceResults output results to the ColorSurfaces component gives the following eror:\n\n1. None of the connected srfData could be matched with the surfaces in the connected HBZones. Note that this component does not currenlty work for curved geometry E+ simulations because the surfaces are broken up and meshed in order to run it through E+.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 31, 2014 at 11:03PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1197342", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1197147"}
