{"body": "\nHi Claudia,\n\nPlease find a sample attached. I have added a small component that helps you calculate the number you're interested in. The component has tooltip descriptions.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn the attached file, I am calculating the number of minutes as you mentioned in the original post. However, you can change the _timeStep_ on sunpath\u00a0and set it to 1 to get the number of hours.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/*ix1zXEQDKP6TQx3Z5fO*8xDdQcOEQ*xeIrsL2UcXDMPQoHofWdI74Kiadx5VT8ehUiKsjiJABBQbjMn8RYX*UJR-H-ObHDJ/Above50.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/*ix1zXEQDKP6TQx3Z5fO*8xDdQcOEQ*xeIrsL2UcXDMPQoHofWdI74Kiadx5VT8ehUiKsjiJABBQbjMn8RYX*UJR-H-ObHDJ/Above50.JPG)\n\nHope this helps!\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1684707", "name": "SunlightHours.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "February 04, 2017 at 12:56AM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1684736", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1684706"}
