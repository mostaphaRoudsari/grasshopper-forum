{"body": "\nThat's weird. That kind of sounds like a similar issue I was having with Dragonfly a while ago. I eventually managed to hunt down the issue by going through the the error logs with Chris, and finding an incompatibility with the matlab dependency and my graphics driver. The fix was to do\u00a0clean install of new drivers, and also change the profile the driver uses.\n\n\n\nI have no idea if this is why your problem is occurring, but I'll paste the solution I used here in case it helps you or anyone else: [https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/161580-matlab-crash...](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/161580-matlab-crashes-when-using-graphics-with-older-nvidia-opengl-drivers) .\u00a0\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the fact that the actual UWG algorithm is written in Matlab makes it really difficult to debug and solve these issues right now. The good news is that it is being rewritten in Python as we speak! Once that is done, and the matlab dependency is gone, I think these issues will either disappear or be a lot easier to resolve.\n\n\n\nS\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "September 15, 2017 at 11:20PM", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1813364", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1814068"}
