{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI am trying to add a new Predicted Mean Vote (from PIERCE foundation, FANGER and PICKUP and DE DEAR), thanks to Python_Script_Editor. But when I tried to visualize the matrix thanks to HoneyBee_Visualize_Microclimate_Map this error appeared \"**Solution exception:index out of range: 1\".**\n\n\n\nFrom my understanding, it seems that the HoneyBee_Visualize_Microclimate_Map component can\u2019t directly read a user-defined matrix (for example \"radTempMtx*2\") and requires that a list of variables be passed (hence the \u201cIronPython.Runtime.List\u201d as a output of the Microclimate_Map analysis).\n\n\u00a0\n\nAm I wrong ? And, in any case: is there a workaround to feed the HoneyBee_Visualize_Microclimate_Map component with a user defined matrix?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you very much for your time and answer\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mehdi HAMDANI", "created_at": "March 28, 2017 at 5:55am", "created_by": "MehdiHAMDANI", "topic": "User defined matrix for HoneyBee_Visualize_Microclimate_Map", "id": "topic_1722644"}
