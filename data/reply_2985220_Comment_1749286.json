{"body": "\nAbraham, Aris already pointed it out but you are right that I would not recommend modelling a tall building with one surface per facade. \u00a0You would want to at least subdivide the facade floor-by-floor and possibly within each floor facade if you want to capture the effects of sun falling in different parts of the building. \u00a0Also, as I mentioned earlier, one really should try to match the internal loads of the \"one-zone building\" with that of the fully detailed one. \u00a0Finally, it goes without saying that this \"one-zone building\" method is really only for outdoor studies. \u00a0Any time that you want info about the interior of a building (like heating/cooling or indoor thermal comfort), you should model the building with at least one zone per floor.\n\nAris, keep us posted as you try to recreate the error.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 3:38pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749055", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749286"}
