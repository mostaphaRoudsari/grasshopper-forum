{"body": "\nHi Petar,\n\nYou can introduce the sky for gridBased and imageBased analysis using the _skyFile input:\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/WA*Dv5OWc2hocQg2jkakuYacz-MMnHnpro90ZW2ZPS8B86nsZ8RQ9t5MJdxTIRaL8qUuuDIQFclcFduJ2o3wNNby*NgH*lTH/skyFileInput.png?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/WA*Dv5OWc2hocQg2jkakuYacz-MMnHnpro90ZW2ZPS8B86nsZ8RQ9t5MJdxTIRaL8qUuuDIQFclcFduJ2o3wNNby*NgH*lTH/skyFileInput.png)\n\nFor other analysis types the skies are special and that's why they have their own recipe.\n\n\n\nDaylight Factor and Vertical Sky Component are using cloudy (overcast) sky as default. You can use uniform sky as an alternative if you want by setting the input to True.\n\n\n\nFor the annual analysis, Daysim takes care of generating the sky. You don't need to generate the sky for each hour as this is exactly what Daysim does.\n\n\n\nIf you want to watch the sky for every hour of the year you can use Ladybug genCumulativeSky, selectSkyMtx and skyDome similar to what I showed in this video (minute 1:15): ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3stJVyaRmg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3stJVyaRmg)). There is an example file for ladybug that called real time radiation analysis that may also help.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 19, 2014 at 8:51pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1028727", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1029124"}
