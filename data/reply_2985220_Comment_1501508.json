{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks for your detailed explanation, that makes a lot of sense. Now I understand why the EP Construction has a higher U-value than the code. But I got one question for ASHRAE 90.1-2010 Extwall Mass Climate zone 7-8, the U-value is 0.054, but the code is 0.071, should I change R-16.84 to R-11.2 in order to make a U-value of 0.075?\u00a0\n\nBest,<br/>Rufei\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rufei Wang", "created_at": "April 5, 2016 at 8:05am", "created_by": "RufeiWang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1501487", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1501508"}
