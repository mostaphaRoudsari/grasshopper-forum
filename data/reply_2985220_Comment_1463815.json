{"body": "\nThanks Mauricio,\n\n(This is so annoying. I'm sure i replied to this a couple of hours ago, and now i see it was not sent. Anyway ...).\n\nI've seen in Humprey's book (Adaptive comfort) the formula you mentioned. This is for European Standards (you remembered the right numbers). ASHRAE 55 is a bit different.\n\nBut my question is more intended to possible cultural, climate conditions accepted temperatures. We discussed those cultural aspects in a different thread. In my case i'm trying to check an historical building under its original conditions. So it is not fair to comply with today's requirements.\n\nSo ,my real question is if it is possible to set a range of comfort temperatures for the adaptive model. Hopefully it is possible, the other question is how/where.\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 15, 2016 at 11:35am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463545", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463815"}
