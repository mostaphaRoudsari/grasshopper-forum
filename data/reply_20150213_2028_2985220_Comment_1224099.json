{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI have some experience in LCA and Carbon footprint analyses. I would love to help in this project. The program daniel reports uses the Otobak database, which is a german free database of building materials. In essence, it is an xml collection of EPD data.\n\n\n\nIt might be a bit outdated. As a personal project I started collecting EPDs of building materials in order for me to be able to quickly assess the environmental impacts of my desings. EPDs report 6 (if I'm not mistaken) LCA environmental indices along with energy metrics.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy goal is to extract this information into perhaps a database that could be used for fast calculations. However, since I can't code to save my life I was planning to extract those info from the EPD files (pdfs) by..ehm..copy pasting..heh.\n\n\n\nI can share my data and assist in any way I can with you in this.\n\n\n\nHowever, as a final note, simply adding up EPD results gives a prediction of these metrics which will not be extremely accurate. Further issues need to be considered, like transportation to your location (EPW file can be used for this?), mode of transportation. Also, not all products have EPDs so using a cement EPD is an approximation, although vastly better than using nothing.\n\n\n\nAnyways, excited for this!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 13, 2015 at 08:28PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1221360", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1224099"}
