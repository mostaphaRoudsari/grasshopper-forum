{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, I'm trying to use your Honeybee's therm component, but i am facing too many problems in turning stage of Rhino surfaces into therm geometries. As you can see the shapes would change. I tried to omit curves, or to add more vertexes or omit the holes, but none of them worked, except omitting the holes which solved one of the errors. \u00a0I am wondering if you have any idea or tips to solve these problems. Many thanks in advance.<br/> about the holes,\u00a0it seems still it cannot simulate a hollow shape, could you check this as well? Thanks.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1516797", "name": "Capture.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Farnaz", "created_at": "April 26, 2016 at 03:25AM", "created_by": "Farnaz609", "topic": "Therm", "id": "topic_1516798"}
