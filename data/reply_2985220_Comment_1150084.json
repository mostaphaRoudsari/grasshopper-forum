{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,<br/><br/>I am dealing with a similar issue as Reinier. I am using the component that you are talking about, however when I run my simulations the results from the first option gets lost. I noticed that the result file only disappears after I toggle off the 'runRAD' and 'WriteRad' inputs in the 'Run daylight simulation' component. Of course I can just copy the results before I do this, but that can be quite inconvenient.\u00a0<br/><br/>Is there perhaps a simpler way of doing this. (Using brute force doesn't quite do it for me either, i.e. same issue) Or is there even a newer version of this component somewhere?<br/><br/>Also, why is this 'runItAll' component not available in the HB or LB components set?<br/><br/>[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-3i3rVffQH0c5V-uWzw5ux2lJBg4wP5fIgX4NF17pAKEWGvA-TiTmGA5hiOBhv413Ipn40LT7*zp7Q1lbUN7gIPRWz8mSCjY/canvas.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-3i3rVffQH0c5V-uWzw5ux2lJBg4wP5fIgX4NF17pAKEWGvA-TiTmGA5hiOBhv413Ipn40LT7*zp7Q1lbUN7gIPRWz8mSCjY/canvas.png)<br/>I've included a quick GH example file.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1150086", "name": "DaylightFactor.gh"}], "created_by_name": "\u00d6rn Erlendsson", "created_at": "October 16, 2014 at 10:05am", "created_by": "OErnErlendsson", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1117147", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1150084"}
