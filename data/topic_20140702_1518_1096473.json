{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\ncompliments for the plug-in very interesting and complete.\n\nI have simulated this type of shading device composed by perforated alluminium sheet (in attached you can find an example). I have the features of the these alluminium panel such as RGB and percentage open area and i set up like trans material. But i don't succeed to link these type of material on their surface and create HB surface.\u00a0\n\n<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/FsV0PLw632qRtUoqrMuowDoBX2wgE0*LzEz8Dgkg8ow4UluKvufSwmPMJKnINYwgrjeipV4C3fAapl0MuMaON-Shc*BBVQRM/Honeybeeerror1.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>\n\nIn this case trans material with shading device. What component i have to use in these analysis.\n\nI hope I shall be clear\n\nThank you so much.\n\nCheers\n\nAndrea\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1096470", "name": "Shading view.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1096471", "name": "Honeybee error1.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1096472", "name": "Canvas.png"}], "created_by_name": "Andrea Zani", "created_at": "July 02, 2014 at 03:18PM", "created_by": "AndreaZani905", "topic": "Problem with honeybee transmaterial", "id": "topic_1096473"}
