{"body": "\nHi Chris, Theodore,\n\n\n\nThank you both for your reply! I missed the SetEPConstruction component myself but it really does what I was looking for for the E+ workflow. On the other hand being able to assign directly EPConstruction and RAD material properties after the glzBasedOnPercentage component has completed its work would be even more straight forward and less time consuming when you want to perform both calculations. In any case already this workflow \u00a0you indicated Chris helps a lot!\n\n\n\non a side note, the glzBasedOnPercentage component is fantastic. I have been using it even for for geometries with 1000+ quad nonplanar surfaces and still works perfect!\n\n\n\nBest\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "January 05, 2016 at 05:37AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1430919", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1430879"}
