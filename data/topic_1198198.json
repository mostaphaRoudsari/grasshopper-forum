{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\u00a0\n\nI'm afraid I have another error with some components.\n\n\n\nWhen I run an energy simulation with your exemple file (Energy shade benefit evaluation), everything is fine, but...\n\nWhen I do the same with my HBzones (constructed with a closed Brep on grasshopper), the preview with the windows is good, the HBzone seems to be ok, but there is some errors in the report I can't understand..\n\n\n\nCould you please check the file? I think there is a problem in the way I design the zones but I don't know where. I plan to defined the zone to have appartment like the third example, which is ok for daylight simulation but not for energy one (see joined file).\n\n\n\nThks you very much (if you have time...)\n\nIlona\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1198197", "name": "TourHexagonaleOptimale-SHADING.gh"}], "created_by_name": "ilona darmon", "created_at": "January 3, 2015 at 6:48pm", "created_by": "ilonadarmon", "topic": "Can't run Energy Simulation", "id": "topic_1198198"}
