{"body": "\nif I use \"Planar\" mode (command \"planar\" in Rhino), will that ensure my surfaces are planar or does object snapping take precedence?\n\nAll your lines will be drawn in the active Cplane so it won't exactly do what are you looking for.\n\n\n\nis there a way to force (transform/simplify) a closed brep with some non planar surfaces to only have planar surfaces? For example, I had a few boxes that had very minor offsets (&lt;1cm) but turned out non planar as a result...<br/>\n\nYes. You can use Grasshopper to do that. There are more sophisticated solutions if you are willing to use plugins such as Kangaroo\u00a0but the simplest way is to\u00a0decompose the brep, get the plane for each face, project the original surfaces on that plane and join them back. The issue with this method is that it will more likely return an open Brep but there are solutions to address that too.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 30, 2015 at 01:07PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1250493", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1252916"}
