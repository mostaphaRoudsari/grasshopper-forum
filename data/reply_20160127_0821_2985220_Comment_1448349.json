{"body": "\nProbably not the best place to ask but what is the state of the OpenStudio compnent? I remember that a few of the HVAC systems were not implemented. Is there an intention of allowing detailed HVAC simulations in HB in the immediate future? That would really popularize HB in practical energy simulations.<br/><br/>Additionally, I'm sure that could be performed with the additional strigns and a lot of E+ experience. Is there a way we develop additional strings for HVAC systems much like the amazing script you made for the evaporative cooling tower?\n\n\n\nAs always, obliged for your great work!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 08:21AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455889", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448349"}
