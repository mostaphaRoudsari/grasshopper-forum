{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nGood news from my side: I get manage to run one simulation fully (indoor_airflow example) on my laptop.\n\nMy first conclusion from my process to get there is: READ CAREFULLY THE INSTRUCTIONS!! I could save a lot of time if i did.\n\nI recommend to add the\u00a0[install OF Readme](http://www.openfoam.com/download/txt/openfoam-windows-readme_v1606+.txt) to the recommendations [thread](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly/wiki/Getting-Started-with-butterfly). Specially people need to pay attention to the prerequisites (virtualization). Second of all, in case you uninstall and reinstall, before the later, be sure you delete the c:\\users\\YOUR_USER_NAME\\.docker and .VirtualBox. It took me 3 installations and 2 uninstalls to make it work.\n\nNow i have a question not related to the thread. Once i get the results, how can i use them without running again. This is a very dumb question, but i don't see the right component and input to do so.\n\nAnd another thing. It is me or after the simulation is done (in the BF_simpleFoam) the GH canvas is behaving slowish? You can sense it pretty much.\n\n\n\nHagit: Not stuck :-). It is working. Tomorrow i'll try the outdoor example, which i see is your case.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 23, 2016 at 03:28PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1586925", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1587108"}
