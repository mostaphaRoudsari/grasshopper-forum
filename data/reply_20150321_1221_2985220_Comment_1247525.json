{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha, I'll check the Radiation Callalilly when I go back home tonight . I took a quick look at it online and I'm not \u00a0sure how to read the results, but haven't tried it myself yet. I'll try it tonight and try to figure out how it works and how to read the results, and hopefully it can serve the purpose of the project I have in mind. Thanks again.\u00a0\n\nRania\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "March 21, 2015 at 12:21PM", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1246418", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1247525"}
