{"body": "\nThanks Chris,\n\nI think the \"super zone\" is not a very good idea, specially if you have a tall building. In this way you'll get only one temperature per surface out of E+. I believe that the MRT calculation can be a bit of erroneous for such cases ... or at least, too gross/coarse.\n\nI suppose that a \"mid super zone\" can be better (maybe one zone per floor or every 2 floors).\n\n\n\nNice that measured temperatures can be customized and used. One day i'll try.\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 7:00am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749122", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749125"}
