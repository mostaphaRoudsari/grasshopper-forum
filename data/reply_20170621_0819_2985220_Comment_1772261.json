{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nAfter mulling over the numbers, I find myself agreeing. I think this list of architectural and environmental factors sums up the persistent temperatures above the comfort zone:\n\n-Only one exterior surface (all others adiabatic)\n\n-Insulated exterior wall (R11)\n\n-Tight construction / small infiltration\n\n-Moderate nighttime temperature, most likely above the balance point temperature for this space. (deltaT=20-30 with nighttime lows around 50-55F)\n\n-Significant solar energy into the space. (0.6 kWh max)\n\nI put together a more aesthetically pleasing graph to help articulate these items. This is for a west facing space that looks at the effect of a flat scheme (no shading), shading, and then with natural ventilation added. Clearly, once the natural ventilation is introduced, the space is able to dissipate heat quickly and the discomfort issue is avoided.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/m7YGxyWvhFWAhIQCUl1QwQXTrpfHo31zQZcen6OwMNC-NCPZx39h6EC0YjM2-toc8T1b0iNZMbrk0OQcXl0Pf*WJVhrbNkdD/Capture.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/m7YGxyWvhFWAhIQCUl1QwQXTrpfHo31zQZcen6OwMNC-NCPZx39h6EC0YjM2-toc8T1b0iNZMbrk0OQcXl0Pf*WJVhrbNkdD/Capture.PNG)\n\n\n\nThanks again Chris.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kit Elsworth", "created_at": "June 21, 2017 at 08:19AM", "created_by": "KitElsworth", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1772015", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1772261"}
