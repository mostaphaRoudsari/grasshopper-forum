{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for replying. I think in a residential situation the acute angle is a bigger issue than offices since rooms and windows are smaller in residential areas. What I guess I'm trying to simulate is someone standing a foot or two from their window, drinking their morning coffee and enjoying their view of the nearby mountain or body of water or whatever landmark is interesting in the area. I realize I'm sort of using the component backwards, but it is really useful in the context I'm applying it in, it is just returning un-realistic results in some situations (where the space needle is 98 degrees off the normal of the window, for example).\n\n\n\nThe weighting factor could also be folded into this, views closer to normal get more weight for example. In my firm I'm asked to produce this analysis a lot, but I hate giving caveats about this angle issue. It also returns counter-intuitive results, making our shaping of the building seem less impactful than it really is.\n\n\n\nAnyways, that is my 2 cents. I might bone up on my vector maths and see if I can't crack it.\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\nShane\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Shane Simon", "created_at": "September 30, 2015 at 07:35PM", "created_by": "ShaneSimon", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1367024", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1371269"}
