{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nIn my opinion the \"easiest\" way is to create a new Construction type (Construction:WindowEquivalentLayer) in HB. If you see above the response from the Helpdesk you need this type to use all the \"Equivalent\" materials. For now, since we can write in a Panel the definitions (as Chris started, and i put together all the definitions in my last attachment) we only need the gate to be able to use them. In this file you can see the definitions, but they are not written in the IDF and/or assigned to the geometry.\n\nChris's proposal seems to me a bit more difficult to implement ... but maybe i'm wrong. You two know better.\n\nMakes any sense?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 15, 2014 at 11:43PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1188661", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1188605"}
