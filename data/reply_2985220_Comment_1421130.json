{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nAfter a very short test I would say that it works fine. I'll let you know if I'll find bugs in the future. Thanks for adding it. I run optimization processes and it's good to be able to turn ON/OFF the randomness.\n\nNow we're able to close quickly the discussions like this one, started by masoumehta, just with a symple \"it's Radiance randomness, just put a -u\". And give a solution to people that struggle with it.\n\nRegards,<br/>Claudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Marini", "created_at": "December 14, 2015 at 7:57am", "created_by": "ClaudioMarini", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1420395", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1421130"}
