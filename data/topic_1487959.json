{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI've been trying to add glazing to my honeybee surfaces for an apartment building (L1) and about 25% of the windows don't show up after I've added them to the surface.\u00a0\n\nI've tried recreating the windows in Rhino many times by drawing a new surface over the top of the 'wall' surface and then changing the size of the new surface to be the size of the window, (to make sure that I have the window on the same plane as the wall) but with no luck.\u00a0\n\nAm I missing something simple here? Or am I just not getting the windows to get on the same planar surface as the walls? - If that is the case is there an easy way in Rhino to ensure that the window is on the same plane as the wall - \u00a0Its driving crazy!\n\nI've attached my Rhino and GH file (please excuse them, they are a bit of a messy work in progress)\n\nThanks\n\nChelle\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chelle Payne", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 10:10pm", "created_by": "ChellePayne", "topic": "Honeybee add glazing component", "id": "topic_1487959"}
