{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\ni was checking the idf file and it was not changing neither for timestep nor for terrain. But in your snapshot it looks fine... I am opening the idf with the energyplus idf editor like you do. Here's the file.\u00a0\n\nThe object i was changing was the infiltration rate on the HB Loads component. But it seems it is working just fine (checked with idf) and my problem was with the \"terrain\" where i thought it was on 3 but it was stuck at 0.\u00a0\n\nCan you explain how i can fix it?\n\nAlways thanks!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1461239", "name": "unnamed.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Iason Bournas", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 4:34pm", "created_by": "IasonBournas", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1461231", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1461238"}
