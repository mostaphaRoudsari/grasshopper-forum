{"body": "\nHello David,\n\n\n\nDF calculation is not time or day sensitive afaik. From my limited knowledge what you essentially do is calculate the daylight performance of your space under a standard luminance value (which yes can vary from place to place). I am not very convinced with Dialux (at least the version I have tried) because it does not offer any control over the radiance and sky properties, unless I missed smth.\n\n\n\nIf you provide us with your HB file and perhaps a table comparing the options used in both people in here would be of great help.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 02, 2016 at 12:11AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1451916", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1452534"}
