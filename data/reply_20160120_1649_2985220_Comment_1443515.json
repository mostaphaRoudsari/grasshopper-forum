{"body": "\nElzine,\n\nI see what the issue is. \u00a0It is probably something wrong with the 'schedulesToValues' function that the component uses to read out hourly schedule values. \u00a0Out of curiosity, are you able to use the \"Honeybee_Convert EnergyPlus Schedules to Values\" component with the custom schedules that you have created?\n\nAs you can see, I do not have these custom schedules on my machine and so they are not being factored in when I run your file:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/tFu4DrQFBvEkUsjsOuIST5UtrBwsJmTqGGCi7Ed*sNTmTQD-pRKMZll9qAdRGF-SP*Tok3KmqXIWKyNoWVFkU7puvH3uOke8/NoSchedules.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/tFu4DrQFBvEkUsjsOuIST5UtrBwsJmTqGGCi7Ed*sNTmTQD-pRKMZll9qAdRGF-SP*Tok3KmqXIWKyNoWVFkU7puvH3uOke8/NoSchedules.JPG)\n\n\n\nIn order to recreate your problem, I am going to need these schedules that you have added on your machine. \u00a0Could you send me the following files from you Ladybug Default Folder:\n\nOpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf\n\nuserCustomEPLibrary.idf\n\n\n\nOnce I have those, I should be able to re-create it and fix it for your case. \u00a0At the least, I can stop the component from completely failing if an incomplete schedule has been connected.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 20, 2016 at 04:49PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1442116", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1443515"}
