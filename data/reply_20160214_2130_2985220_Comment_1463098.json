{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nAgree that the VSC can be applied to any surface, and as a result of that the name change can be in order. But, just thinking/wondering, who will use this for any surface but vertical. This measurement is not giving any useful information for them. At least not what it was intended for. This as opposed to the SVF.\n\nSo instead of changing the name, and diluting the original purpose of the component, maybe a warning or an explanation showing the purpose of the analysis.\n\nThis is one of those situations that \"just because it is possible to do\" can be lead to conceptual mistakes.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 09:30PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463070", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463098"}
