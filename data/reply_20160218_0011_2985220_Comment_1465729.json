{"body": "\nHi Mostapha.\n\nThe time before i have some doubt about the view names, such as how i can get it, where can i define their names. Then i see this.\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/automatical...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/automatically-create-named-rhino-views-from-grasshopper)\n\nIt makes a great sense to my work.\n\n\n\nBut i still have some doubts.\n\n1. As the first i use the setView component to set several points. Does everyone's view name is the same? Are they all to be the 'Perspective'.\n\n2. If the answer is to be true, how can i use the saveView component to redefine their names.\n\n3. If the answer is to be false, then how can i get the name of each point.\n\n\n\nBest regards!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hang Chen", "created_at": "February 18, 2016 at 12:11AM", "created_by": "HangChen", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1456069", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1465729"}
