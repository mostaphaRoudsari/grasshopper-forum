{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\nI am running a Daylight simulation with Honeybee, and I am trying to get some results also with the last version of Diva.\n\nI was wondering if there is a way to run the daylight simulation only for a specific amount of time. I'm modeling a school, so I'm interested only in what happens during the months of school occupancy.\n\nIs there a specific component I can use or is there a way to add the schedule that I create?\n\nThank you all for your work and time.\n\nCarlie\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carlie_3", "created_at": "January 15, 2017 at 4:43am", "created_by": "Carlie_3", "topic": "Question about daylight simulation with Honeybee", "id": "topic_1672109"}
