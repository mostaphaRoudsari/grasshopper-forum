{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am trying to calculate how much solar radiation falls on my model and would also like to include the reflected radiations from the ground. Is there anyway I can do it. I guess not, having had a look at another post which asks the user to instead go with honeybee to achieve that.\n\nPerhaps there is another component which can achieve that?\n\n\n\nBut I do not want to do daylight analysis at the moment, but would just wan an overall picture to understand what portions of different radiations fall on my model.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\nAnurag\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anurag Verma", "created_at": "February 9, 2017 at 9:10am", "created_by": "AnuragVerma", "topic": "Ground reflection using Ladybug", "id": "topic_1688542"}
