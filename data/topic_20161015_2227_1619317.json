{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI wanted to share an idea for the community.\n\n\n\nA lot of people here, for the last few years, have been using LB and HB to develop thousands and thousands of models and run what is probably millions of simulations.\n\n\n\nOne of the strengths of this community is it's open source attitude, not only in terms of code but also in terms of work and experience of its users.\n\n\n\nBased on this, i would like to suggest a community project that will collect all material definitions for either Energy Plus or Radiance models that users in this forum are/have been using in their models and are willing to share.\n\nMy suggestion would be that this is some kind of an online database in which users can tap into (perhaps directly from HB components in GH) and use any of the available definitions in their models.\n\n\n\nI promise to make a start once this hellish upcoming week is over. I have not really used many custom made material definitions but I will share what I have. I will also try and go over all discussions in the forum history and dig out things that were already shared by users.\n\n\n\nHope that people think this is a good idea. Open to suggestions on how to actually implement this so that it can be a useful feature for everyone.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "October 15, 2016 at 10:27PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "[COMMUNITY PROJECT]: Material Database for Energy+, Radiance and Therm", "id": "topic_1619317"}
