{"body": "\nOk I just figured out an error in my definition that might be related to what you explained. Once I correctly updated my boolean check for minimal distance, the result of the simulation (average VSC) is null which breaks the pollination. The .csv file stopped at the last entry before the first false value :( That was a time consuming debugging of my definition ..\n\n\n\nI'm going to introduce a new check to set the value to 0 when so that pollination won't crush. I wonder if there is a way to avoid this because the point is that I don't want the null results in my csv file. I guess it will be easy to delete with filtering in excel but still. I must be doing something wrong.\n\n\n\nEdit: It was a very easy solution! Didn't even lose any time since the recorders have the data connected! I just used a replaceNull component on the output of the recorder and substituted it with 0.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 10:58pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448030", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447893"}
