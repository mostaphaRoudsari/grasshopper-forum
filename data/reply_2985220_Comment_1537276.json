{"body": "\nHi Francesco,\n\n\n\nWe are currently working on combining CFD results with LB/HB and Chris's wonderful tools. Experimentation so far has been quite successful and we are just waiting on a few example studies to release initial results.\n\n\n\nI think it might be interesting to compare this method with a tool like Envi-met, which from what I understand is quite popular in urban micro-climate studies. If you want, I could assist you with setting up and running CFD simulations of your model. We could then pass the wind velocities into Chris's micro-climate analysis tools and compare the final results with what you have through Envi-met.\n\n\n\nI believe this experiment could be valuable for all of us. Let me know if this sounds like a good idea\u00a0 and we can move it forward.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 26, 2016 at 8:55pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537094", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537276"}
