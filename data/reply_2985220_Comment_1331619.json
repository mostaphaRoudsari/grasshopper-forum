{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nHoneybee by default assumes that you usually want to color zones with energy intensity rather than total energy. \u00a0If you want to see energy and not energy intensity, you have to set both the 'normByFlrArea' to false on the 'Read EP Result' component AND the 'normalizeByFloorArea' to false on the 'Color Zones' component.\n\nThe reason why the windows energy was showing up as an average was because the component was treating it the same way that it does temperature (since not all outputs of E+ can be meaningfully normalized by the floor area). \u00a0I have tried to re-write the function that senses the data type in the color zones component but please understand that this is a difficult function to write since E+ has thousands of outputs and I can't write something to catch them all.\n\nSee your case working in the attached file.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1331620", "name": "tut_test_v017_ZJ_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 11:50pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1331033", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1331619"}
