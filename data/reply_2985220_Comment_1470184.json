{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nHave a quick question to you, a bit off topic.\n\nIn the same example file you \"prepare geometry\", I'm a bit confused here, since I watched Chris's tutorials first, where he used to keep the faces untouched and just create windows as coplanar surfaces where he needed.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/tUpf1dE*xKYOX2ZESlcz*RhcI4WPb6Ax1tYj6QQb7-*HgqxN7wdwPsyDLhNTFZ9E0flsIMo*S5Zk28jDFO4ZRtMY3YeRD-AE/Capture.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/tUpf1dE*xKYOX2ZESlcz*RhcI4WPb6Ax1tYj6QQb7-*HgqxN7wdwPsyDLhNTFZ9E0flsIMo*S5Zk28jDFO4ZRtMY3YeRD-AE/Capture.PNG)\n\n\n\nBoth ways seem to give same results, can you comment on this? I'd like to go Chris's minimalistic simple way but want to be sure there are no caveats.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "February 23, 2016 at 11:36pm", "created_by": "Timur582", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1470316", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1470184"}
