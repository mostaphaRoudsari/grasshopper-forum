{"body": "\nThanks, Chris! Update solve the problem.\n\n\n\nNow the **readEPSurfaceResult** component is not working, even if the eio file is put in the same folder as the csv file. Appreciate your advice!\n\n\n\nAlso, one of the zone-based output variable \"**Zone Ideal Loads Zone Total Cooling Energy [J](Hourly)**\" is not shown in the otherZoneData component.\n\n\n\nIt'll be great if other **non-zone/surface based output variables** such as \"DistrictCooling:HVAC [J](Hourly)\" can also be visualized in HB.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1298519", "name": "error_read_eplus_csv_CWM_oat2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "May 29, 2015 at 04:27AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1296934", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1298518"}
