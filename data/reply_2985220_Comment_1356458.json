{"body": "\nRon and All,\n\nThank you for finding/verifying the bug and thank you, Mostapha, for fixing it. \u00a0This resulted from some new code that I put in that correctly checks the normal direction of surfaces. \u00a0Apologize that, in my lack of familiarity with this part of the code, I fixed one bug with normals while creating another with the center points. \u00a0I am glad that everything is good now and I will be more diligent about being on the forums after I make a big change like this in the future. Next time, I will hopefully nip the problem in the bud before all of you have to test it so many times.\n\nThank you, again.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 7, 2015 at 12:45pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1355512", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1356458"}
