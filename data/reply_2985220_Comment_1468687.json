{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI read from you(in several discussion) that E+ doesn't support custom shading device, but I really need to study thermal efficiency of a custom shading device;\n\nI used both blinds(with windows) and \"EP Context Surface\"\n\nI noticed that the only parameters that work are the \"ShadeTransmittanceSchedule\" applied to the\u00a0\"EP Context Surface\";\u00a0\n\nthere is any chance to set up solar absorptivity and emissivity to the external shading device? I read on a scientific paper that it is possible with DesignBuilder that works with EnergyPlus..\n\ncontrary, could you suggest any example of\u00a0good algorithms that can analyze the quantity of solar radiation to use blinds materials?\n\nin the file attached I simplified my shading device making a sort of grid;\n\nCould you please help me?\n\nthank you in advance,\n\nErnesto\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1468689", "name": "Ern_Window Shade.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ernesto Cesario", "created_at": "February 22, 2016 at 9:46am", "created_by": "ErnestoCesario", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1210126", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1468687"}
