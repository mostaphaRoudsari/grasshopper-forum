{"body": "\nDear All,\n\nAfter replacing the honeybee_honeybee user object (due to the latest update regarding the therm gasses info) when I load the file I get an error message.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, some components don't recognize that honeybee is flying. This is fixed when I disable-enable those components.\u00a0\n\nIts not a fatal error but it certainly is a nuisance.\u00a0\n\nWondering if someone else has had a similar problem.\u00a0\n\n\n\nkind regards,\u00a0\n\nMauricio\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1454181", "name": "components_on_boot.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1454182", "name": "dynamic_u_val_2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mauricio Aguilar Cardenas", "created_at": "February 04, 2016 at 03:18AM", "created_by": "MauricioAguilarCardenas135", "topic": "Weird behaviour of Components on Loading the File", "id": "topic_1454183"}
