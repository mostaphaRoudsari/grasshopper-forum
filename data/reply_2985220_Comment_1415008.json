{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\u00a0\n\nThank you for your reply, indeed you can create. I exported some material already and will apply them. I will update the post soon. Is a pity but understand the copyrights issues! :) \u00a0One thing that bugs me is that the evaluation of the results is more based on common sense rather than accuracy since I am not really sure if E+ will actually reads the created BDSF correctly. Do you have any sort of checkpoints for this? for example when you create material (in HB) and write them in the material library how do you check if E+ runs a correct simulation with the new material? (except from a qualitative evaluation)\n\n\n\nTasos \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "December 4, 2015 at 7:41am", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1413052", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1415008"}
