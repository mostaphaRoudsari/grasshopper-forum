{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nIs it easy to go over the file for me? I'm very interested in performing such an evaluation and even though I can understand the geometry part, the glazing part is hard to decipher.\n\n\n\nWhat do the labels 'connect before' and 'connect after' the simulation mean? Is there a specific way of doing the simulation (i.e. steps)? Thank you very much in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 09, 2015 at 04:44AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1116147", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1221075"}
