{"body": "\nI truly appreciate and admire the work that Chris has done on the outdoor microclimate map. It shows great potential in it's flexibility and accuracy - especially when combined with Butterfly.\n\nWhat I see as this method's greatest weakness is the complexity of calculating surface temperatures. Have any quicker methods been considered for calculating (especially facade) surface temperatures? I am guessing that reasonable estimations for surface temperatures could be produced without doing energy modeling for the interior spaces, by simply assuming a constant temperature for the interior faces of walls.\n\nWith a quicker surface temperature calculation this tool could easily be used for larger urban contexts.\n\nApologies if this topic has already been covered someplace else. Thanks for all the great work, development team!\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ernst Bay", "created_at": "September 01, 2016 at 11:02AM", "created_by": "ErnstBay", "topic": "Quicker estimate for surface temperatures for outdoor microclimate map", "id": "topic_1592062"}
