{"body": "\nHello all,\n\nHaving set up an energy model (through HB) that uses separate zones to model double skin facades (DSFs), I'd like to do the same with the roof construction. But, I can't figure out how to create a glazed floor component (to match to the skylight in the adjacent zone). I have done this before in straight OpenStudio (with the sketchup interface), so that's an option, but it'd be great to get it done within the HB workflow.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your thoughts!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Novelli", "created_at": "August 3, 2016 at 12:53pm", "created_by": "NickNovelli", "topic": "Double skin roof in HB/OS?", "id": "topic_1576163"}
