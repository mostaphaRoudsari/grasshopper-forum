{"body": "\nHi Robert,\n\nAttached a working version.\n\nPlenty of issues to solve :-)\n\n1. The more critical one. You hooked the zone, afyter rotating it, to a HB_Mass2Zone. This move cancelled the windows definition. I connected the proper inputs to the HB_createHBZones component instead. If you see in your file the HB_decomposeByType you\"ll see that before the rotate the model is ok and after the rotate it isn't (see group red and green in the attached). Do that in your model not in mine.\n\n2. Critical one also. You connected EP materials to the HB_Surface instead of connecting EP_Construction.\n\nIn the way to understand what was wrong i updated the file, but after finishing the fix this is not important.\n\nGood luck,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1273499", "name": "mod_3_simple_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 26, 2015 at 1:09pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1273154", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1273498"}
