{"body": "\nSweet, I think it'll be pretty cool.\n\n\n\nOff the top of my head, the workflow I would suggest is modelling a series of planar surfaces, and then applying, one by one, the radiation analysis on them.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI don't think a 3d grid would work, for the same reason you'd have to run the radiation analyses separately: you're going to want to avoid self-shading geometries. This is only a pain if you want a denser 3D grid, in which case you might want to look into creating a GH or Python script script to automate the isolation and application of your radiation analysis. \u00a0\n\n\n\nS\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "May 25, 2015 at 1:07am", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1294043", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1294229"}
