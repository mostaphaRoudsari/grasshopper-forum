{"body": "\nHi everyone,\u00a0\n\nI am trying to show the VSC (vertical sky component) over the facade of a building but turns out the output I get is 14 times bigger that the number of points in my grid, and therefore the \"Ladybug re-color mesh\" component fails to work. Does anyone know why is are the results larger than my grid and how could I make it work?\u00a0\n\nThanks!\n\nAlejandro[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/n9CkP9pTfMNWeHrrIfaOu-iu1evQdisRLs65*Apqz-gXcDPmx9DW1CcS9nLkAdKQrsbJVOMpCkbGeV4wmJgTV5i-fLsB03Z6/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/n9CkP9pTfMNWeHrrIfaOu-iu1evQdisRLs65*Apqz-gXcDPmx9DW1CcS9nLkAdKQrsbJVOMpCkbGeV4wmJgTV5i-fLsB03Z6/Capture.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "October 29, 2014 at 08:22AM", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Showing VSC over a grid", "id": "topic_1157911"}
