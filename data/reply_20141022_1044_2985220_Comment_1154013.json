{"body": "\nI guess I'm still confused, I never applied the material directly. I made my construction using two layers of glass and a layer of air in between and plugged into the EPConstruction component and then added it to the ep_library using the \"AddtoEnergyplus Library\" component.\n\nThe only parameters of glass I want to manipulate are the three (U, SHGC and VT). The amount of parameters is not my problem.\n\nI just want to simply take the construction I made and plug it into the windowEPConstruction slot of the modifiedHBZone component and then run a simulation. However when I do so energyplus reports that it can't get surface data for the material.\n\nFrom your response Abraham, I'm gathering that this is not possible to do this in honeybee and that I have to make my custom materials in energyplus itself first?\n\n\n\nUnfortunately I also have to keep manually downloading the master zip files from github and plug it into the update honeybee/ladybug components respectively as well. The automatic update isn't working as it reports an issue that the remote party has closed the transport stream. This was a separate issue I thought but could it have something to do with why the simulation isn't reading my custom construction?\n\n\n\nApologies for any of my misunderstandings, your time and patience is extremely appreciated as always.\n\nAaron\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "October 22, 2014 at 10:44AM", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1153638", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1154013"}
