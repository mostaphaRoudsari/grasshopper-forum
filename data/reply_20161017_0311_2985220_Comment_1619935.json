{"body": "\nThanks Chris and Mostapha for your reply.\n\nActually i am still using the EnergyPlus simulation component (the one updated\u00a0on the\u00a04th of september 2016) because i thought it was still working correctly and also because I\u00a0always get strange errors using the open studio one.\n\nFor example, if i\u00a0put in my workflow (which is working with E+) the openstudio component instead of the E+ one, once i run the simulation i receive these following errors:\n\n\n\n**- 1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error:** <br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 ** Severe\u00a0 ** IP: IDF line~729 Error detected for Object=DESIGNSPECIFICATION:OUTDOORAIR**\n\n**- 2. The simulation has failed because of this fatal error:** <br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 **\u00a0 Fatal\u00a0 ** IP: Errors occurred on processing IDF file. Preceding condition(s) cause termination.**\n\n\n\nDo you know why?\n\nCan I still use the EnergyPlus simulation component?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\nClaudia\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "October 17, 2016 at 03:11AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619573", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619935"}
