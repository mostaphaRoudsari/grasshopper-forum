Straight to the problem.\n\n\n\nI'd like to incorporate the graph with the model in an attempt to make it a bit more visually pleasing (failed attempt below))).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/XK6ftf7dlABGcH2RhP6KMcZN6kBCz6eAy6Q9a33tzQBK07EwP2qojs9bkqaqqMpYuydvr02tB**5iemkFQEePBwNJt5C31tW/LegendLocationError.jpg?width=540\" width=\"540\"/>](http://api.ning.com/files/XK6ftf7dlABGcH2RhP6KMcZN6kBCz6eAy6Q9a33tzQBK07EwP2qojs9bkqaqqMpYuydvr02tB**5iemkFQEePBwNJt5C31tW/LegendLocationError.jpg)\n\nWhat I want is to move the legend to the far right point, but it seems that I can't do it with Rhino point, nor with GH move component (see image below).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/XK6ftf7dlAD7SKHgF5xbGyaaIcWG3VHR7cocfEeSn-L8hYVqbvbHhW1P*NwhKV1lVWy8KhLPV57uWk9eWUttV*1bQdrniQOm/Canvasat132019.png?width=540\" width=\"540\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/XK6ftf7dlAD7SKHgF5xbGyaaIcWG3VHR7cocfEeSn-L8hYVqbvbHhW1P*NwhKV1lVWy8KhLPV57uWk9eWUttV*1bQdrniQOm/Canvasat132019.png)\n\nIs it a bug or am I missing something?\n\n\n\nP.S.
