{"body": "\nHi Dimitris, It is a bit tricky. Give me more time to think about this. In this case we cannot add to -ab since we don't want to have reflections to be ambient reflections to be considered in the calculation. At the same time it will make discrepancy in the results. There should be a way to set radiance parameters to get this right. I won't be able to get to this problem right now but I added this to github as a wish and will take care of it soon: ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/174](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/174)).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 26, 2014 at 09:29PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1121201", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1121924"}
