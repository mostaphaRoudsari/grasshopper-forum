{"body": "\nHi Chris!\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply. It makes sense. Would it be very wrong of me, in cases where I do not want to model mechanical systems, to \"isConditioned\" On and then edit the thermostats in a way that the AC part of my ACMV will never work?\n\n\n\nI know it's lazy and creates bad models perhaps but it would be a nice way to start in first phases when I do not have the information (or the will) required to go in detailed mode.\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 17, 2015 at 6:39pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1288689", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1289019"}
