{"body": "\nalright, so i'll have to stick with writing the case via BF and then manually copy it to my EC2 instance and run it there.\n\nI've done plenty of simulations on AWS, the cool thing about that is you can create clusters and have as much computing power as you like. That way I've done some complex simulations with more than a hundred cores. There are some good explanations for creating clusters and running OF on the Amazon cloud in general on this site:\u00a0[https://cfd.direct/cloud/aws/](https://cfd.direct/cloud/aws/)\n\n\n\nCheers\n\nAlbert\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Albert Pressler", "created_at": "March 25, 2017 at 07:13AM", "created_by": "AlbertPressler", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1720447", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1720487"}
