{"body": "\nHey Tim,\n\nI imported your .ini files and I was able to replicate the error. \u00a0I have not re-written the capture view component to deal with your case yet but I know what is causing the error. \u00a0You should be able to get the transparency to work on your machine by going to Options&gt;View&gt;Display Modes and, for each display mode, set the Background under Viewport settings to \"Use Application Settings.\" \u00a0For the Rendered mode, you should change this Background to \"Use Render Settings.\" \u00a0Right now, you have all of these set to \"Solid Color\", which does not currently work.\n\nI'll try to rewrite the component code to sense this in the future and I will post back here once I do so.\n\nI don't know how you are trying to use the component with the timer. \u00a0If you post an example GH file showing the issue, that might make it easier to understand.\n\n\n\nThe plan for getting involved in coding sounds great. \u00a0Let me know when you get some time to delve into python and I'll send you a list of resources. \u00a0Good luck with finishing up uni and the job search!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 14, 2016 at 9:28pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1508722", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1508970"}
