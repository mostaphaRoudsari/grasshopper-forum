{"body": "\nHi Zack,\n\nThere were a number of things in your file that were not so good. \u00a0The first is that you were solving adjacencies of a zone with itself, which technically does not cause E+ to fail but it gives you erroneous results. \u00a0The second issue was that your model had no thermal mass in it, which can make the simulation unstable.\n\n\n\nThe mechanical ventilation energy that you are getting is because you still have an economizer in the ideal air system, which is mixing in cool outdoor air whenever the zone needs cooling and the outdoor air is cool. \u00a0If you would rather use the cooling coil of the ideal air system to cool the zone instead, you can remove the economizer with the air details component as you see in the attached file. Now, you end up with an energy balance with no mechanical ventilation:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7AOoV0m95HlAt-F1rU-GBApKP6*kHG9nOCuiNyOqlSVpzzl8yvTL8nu7uFfMisFQ**iZN8r69YbHKQAZByeRXPs9qdiZgACr/NoMechVent.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/7AOoV0m95HlAt-F1rU-GBApKP6*kHG9nOCuiNyOqlSVpzzl8yvTL8nu7uFfMisFQ**iZN8r69YbHKQAZByeRXPs9qdiZgACr/NoMechVent.JPG)\n\n\n\nAlso, if you are trying to compare HVAC system sizes and peak loads, you should really be using the OpenStudio component and eio parser as mentioned in this discussion:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/heating-and...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/heating-and-cooling-loads)\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1628773", "name": "SouthWestCornerRoom_FlatWindows_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 29, 2016 at 03:26PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1627899", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1628771"}
