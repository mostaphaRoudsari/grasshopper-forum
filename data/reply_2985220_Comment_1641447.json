{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Xiaojian,\n\n\n\nMy results and observations are following:\n\n\n\n1. Please find attached image named observations. air wall is defined in solve adjacency component and this puts an air wall adjacent to an interior wall. I disconnected this air wall and the model runs fine I ran it for 19 generations for over the period of 7 hours.\n\n\n\n2. Earlier, when I ran the model with air wall connected to altConstruction_, I observed that in the middle of this optimization process, one or many zones will disappear altogether from rhino scene and that is when the results became undefined. In the image you attached, if you see in the top left corner, zone Commercial 1F is missing. I witnessed a similar behavior. This \u00a0disappearance of zones may explain the erratic highs and lows in fitness numbers that you are talking about.\n\n\n\n3. I also made a few changes in how you apply glazing ratios. Please find file with changes.\n\n\n\n4. My results are attached as well. When I used air wall as altConstruction, the model ran for 7 generations and then started displaying errors as I mentioned in my earlier responses. After removing air wall and making a change in how glazing ratio is applied, the model ran successfully for 19 generations.\n\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\nDevang\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1641448", "name": "Observation.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1641449", "name": "Results.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "November 17, 2016 at 1:04pm", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "topic_1640505", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1641447"}
