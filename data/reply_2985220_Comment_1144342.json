{"body": "\nHi Hui-ling,\n\nI can see that Chris has already answered to a number of your questions in an email. Can you update me here that which questions are still valid? Also I suggest to post your questions one by one as it will be much easier to help.\n\nAlso please update your components to the latest version. That may solve couple of issues that you have here.\n\nBack to your question about fenestration, if it is a regular perforated screen then you can use mixedFunctions, otherwise you can just create the geometry as a brep and put it in front of the window. Are they dynamic or just fixed shadings?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 6, 2014 at 8:59pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1143723", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1144342"}
