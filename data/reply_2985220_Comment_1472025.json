{"body": "\nhi, it's me again, I fixed it up by modifying a little on the rhino models. The component can not split the surface so we have to prepare it on rhino modeling. Now I reupload the files so someone who have the same problem can know what happens.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0smQHvjc5TfClo6safvk6WCRTt*4Nd8toM49zrJriU04DMtebU0iPl6OtiGbh*5h8W9-5zAfj9WHNfDZrvVg2UoNA4hpsalQ/X47_2S8E8ETSMT_CIQ.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0smQHvjc5TfClo6safvk6WCRTt*4Nd8toM49zrJriU04DMtebU0iPl6OtiGbh*5h8W9-5zAfj9WHNfDZrvVg2UoNA4hpsalQ/X47_2S8E8ETSMT_CIQ.png)\n\nI read the processing to know that u use \"Bang\" to explode all the surfaces. Then I'm wondering if it works when just use rhino Boolean calculation split the surfaces, so maybe we don't have to split the overlapped surfaces manually every time, especially when dealing with complicated models. I'm trying on it but maybe I'm wrong. After splitting we also have to combine each unit blocks rather than combine them together. If u know anything please teach me.\n\n\n\nThank u very much :)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1472027", "name": "testified outwalls.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chryl Lee", "created_at": "February 25, 2016 at 11:59pm", "created_by": "ChrylLee", "parent_id": "topic_1471831", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1472025"}
