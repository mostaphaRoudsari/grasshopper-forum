{"body": "\nJulien,\n\n\n\nI am glad that you were able to get the model to run. \u00a0To answer your Rhino questions, I will first say that it can be very easy to make bad geometry in Rhino, especially if you are a new user who is just learning how to use Rhino. \u00a0Rhino offers great geometric freedom and power but, as they say, with great power comes great responsibility.\n\n\n\n1. Object snapping will always take precedence in Rhino over the Planar mode. \u00a0So you really have to create your surfaces as planar from the start. \u00a0Extruding curves and/or making boxes will always ensure planar surfaces.\n\n\n\n2. As I said, you really need to make sure that you make your geometry planar from the start. \u00a0There's no easy fix to turn all nonplanar surfaces into a planar ones but you should remember that triangles are always planar and, because of this, meshing will always produce planar geometries (or if you have a simple way of breaking up a surface into triangles, this will probably be better than automated meshing).\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 31, 2015 at 5:22pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1253242", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1253850"}
