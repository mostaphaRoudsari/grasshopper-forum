{"body": "\nElly,\n\nI just added type hints on three the Ladybug analysis components so you should not have this issue again:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/9904949034eecf02...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/9904949034eecf02601d518e7651a1267c55b2d2)\n\nAlso, I see that you are trying to use the context transmittance input on the radiation analysis and I have to say that I decided to remove this after I was given a few scenarios of how new users might easily misunderstand it and get incorrect results. Instead, I recommend that you model this with Honeybee, which is a safer and more fool-proof way of accounting for radiation that has to pass through several surfaces with the same transmittance.\n\nThanks for bringing the type hint issue to our attention.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 9, 2017 at 7:15pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1686685", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1688507"}
