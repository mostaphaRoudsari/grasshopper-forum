{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha, Chris and group members,\n\n\n\nI made a little experiment about a small house by adaptive comfort method to check the influence to interior comfort by different passive operations, such as natural ventilation. The result seemed odd that showed great approximately 50% increase in interior comfort after natural ventilation, even the winter time turned warm inside the house. \u00a0That was incomprehensible to me. So I am wondering whether my gh file setting was not correct, or could anyone help me to explain it?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you very much.[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/gCx7TixaLiNkvtBU4sXGS8S9hAtRahtG32A52LVESMaIDNdwva8RwU0dp8kkQwf6K*2tzCmZYsxqRaHcie*lgy*R5fIRKPYS/11111111111111111111111111.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/gCx7TixaLiNkvtBU4sXGS8S9hAtRahtG32A52LVESMaIDNdwva8RwU0dp8kkQwf6K*2tzCmZYsxqRaHcie*lgy*R5fIRKPYS/11111111111111111111111111.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "January 06, 2017 at 04:58AM", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "topic": "Problems about the Adaptive Comfort Accuracy", "id": "topic_1667640"}
