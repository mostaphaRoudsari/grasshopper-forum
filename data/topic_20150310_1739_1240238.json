{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI am trying to create a house/unit with a semi-basement and an attic floor. I created (or tried to) Air Walls between the \"basement\" zone and the \"1st floor zone\" and between the \"3rd floor zone\" and the \"Attic floor\" as I named them. I then assign materials, schedules, properties etc but from the analyses I understand that the Air Walls are not considered Air walls but normal ceilings/floors. To double check I ran a Daylight analysis on the \"basement's\" surface to examine if I had any daylight. Unfortunately answer is none. I also check my E+ which also showed that there is no Air Walls in the analysis. I went through all available tuttorials and discussions and followed what is in the example files. Profoundly is something that I am missing and due to overtime (I am modelling 47 of them with different geometries) \u00a0I cannot see.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am attaching my gh definition in case someone can have a look and check what am I doing wrong or reading wrong or using wrong in there!\u00a0\n\n\n\nFinally I am trying to use the **HB_Add InternalMass to Zone\u00a0**component which needs to be re-instantiated every time I open my definition, else is giving a warning or error!\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nTasos\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1240237", "name": "AIRWALL_Construction_EP&RADanalysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "March 10, 2015 at 05:39PM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "topic": "AirWalls E+ and Daylight Analysis (and InternalMass problem?)", "id": "topic_1240238"}
