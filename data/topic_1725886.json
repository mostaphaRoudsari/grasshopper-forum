{"body": "\nA question about setting up the proper controls for conducting a night flush sequence during the summer. I recognize that the Honeybee_Set EP Airflow component allows me to set the maxOutdoorTemp and maxIndoorTemp for natural ventilation but it seems using these controls does not produce a logical sequence to determine when to flush.\n\nFor example, just using the maxOutdoorTemp, if I set it to 33C (studied comfort threshold for Indian populations), the flush sequence will not start until outdoor temp drops below 33C even if outdoor temp is significantly lower than indoor. I am seeing this occur in the late-night and early hours of the day when indoor temps rise above 33C from daily heat gains. The indoor temp may be around 37C and outdoor temp can be 34C, yet no cooling will occur since outdoor has not dropped below 33C yet. The zone remains in a closed state until the outdoor temp drops below 33C which may occur at 4am, which leads to minimal flush hours.\u00a0\n\nWhat I desire is the ability to write a sequence/conditional statement that will operate the ventilation based on the indoor-outdoor temperature difference. If outdoor temperature is ever lower than indoor in the cooling season, night flush should ensue.\u00a0\n\nIs there currently a way to create this type of logic diagram?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kit Elsworth", "created_at": "April 2, 2017 at 1:25pm", "created_by": "KitElsworth", "topic": "Honeybee Night Flush", "id": "topic_1725886"}
