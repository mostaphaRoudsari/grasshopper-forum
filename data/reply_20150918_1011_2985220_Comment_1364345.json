You could create a CSV schedule for 24 hours and then only that run that period in the Run EnergyPlus component using the _analysisPeriod_ input and the _AnalysisPeriod component. \u00a0I think that would be the best way to do it.[<br/>](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/VinuSubashini)\n\n2. The file attached is the example file for the Set EP Air Flow component from the Honeybee example files. Have a look at it.\n\n3. The details of this can be found in the EnergyPlus documentation specially the Engineering reference.\n\n\n\n[http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/engineering-reference/win...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/engineering-reference/window-calculation-module.html#window-calculation-module)\n\n\n\n\n\n4. I'd suggest that you check the EnergyPlus documentation, on this but my suggestion is:\n\nA. For windows use the Set_EP Air Flow component set the temperature so that the windows will never been closed due to temperature , and then set your own schedule using openingAreaFractionalSched_.\n\nB. Use the Shade generator component with a custom blindsSchedule for the blinds.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\nAnton\n\n[Vinu Subashini](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/VinuSubashini)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1364347", "name": "016_Natural Ventilation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "September 18, 2015 at 10:11AM", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "topic_1362518", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1364345"}
