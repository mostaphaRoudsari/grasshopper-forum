{"body": "\nHello everybody!\n\n\n\nI was recently testing some components, focusing on a thermal comfort.\n\n\n\nI have found out, that for instance - OutdoorComfortCalculator - which considers temperatures of 9-26 and other factors, gives the % of comfortable time outdoor for instance in Kenya in Africa (high temperatures and humidity) 55%, whereas within the same .epw data and some additional factors added to the Thermal Indices component, the \"humidex\" or \"Discomfort index\" give a result drastically lower, I think it was even 1-5% comfortable.\n\n\n\nHow is that?\n\n\n\nAlso, OutdoorComfortCalculator shows the comfortable time %. But it considers both day and night. Isn't that day is much more important than night, as people do many activities and really \"use\" the architecture or public space, so this % is a bit misleading? Somebody might think, that 50% comfortable is quite good, but if its only during the night time, than it seems not so... \"practical\"? Perhaps it would be better to find a % of a comfort during the day time specifically.\n\n\n\nAnybody had the same thoughts or problems about that? Is my way of thinking correct?\n\n\n\nRegards!\n\n\n\nJacek\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jacek Urbanowicz", "created_at": "June 20, 2016 at 08:46PM", "created_by": "JacekUrbanowicz", "topic": "Difference between \"OutdoorComfortCalculator\" component and \"ThermalComfortIndices\" component", "id": "topic_1551290"}
