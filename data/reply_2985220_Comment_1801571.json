{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\ni understand.\n\nAbout the passive strategies, i was following [this discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/passive-strategy-list-psych-chart). I understand that there is still lack of information to understand how ClimateConsultant define some of the strategies (shading, thermal mass, radiation). Still i miss the implementation of such strategies.\n\nThe bioclimatic chart needs also to implement better some of them.\n\nI was sitting with my TA for next semester and we are moving fully to LB. We are trying to have the same \"functionalities\" we had until now with other tools. That's why i'm asking so much. We are trying to set, at the very beginning of the design process the strategies to implement in the project, JUST from the climatic conditions.\n\n\n\nThanks and sorry if i'm messing things here,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 21, 2017 at 8:43am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1801380", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1801571"}
