{"body": "\nHello\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am wondering how I can create only one legend, rather than multiple, for daylighting simulation in case I have multiple zones? basically, HB creates one legend per space and I want it to eliminate those and create one big legend for my whole floor plan. Please see the attached files.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your help\u00a0\n\n\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1644366", "name": "SingleTime-Sep21_12pm.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1644367", "name": "CCC_Honeybee_Gridbased_22_11_16.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 22, 2016 at 12:46PM", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "One Legend for Multiple Zones in Daylighting Simulation", "id": "topic_1644368"}
