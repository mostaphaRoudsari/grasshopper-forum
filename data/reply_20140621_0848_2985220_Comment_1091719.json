{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen I change the unit of my rhino model from Millimeter to Meter, I got the correct adjacent surfaces from \" Solve adjacencies \" component. Is that because of something related to \"tolerance\" as I saw this within the code - **def** **shootIt**(rayList, geometry, tol = 0.01, bounce =1)\n\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, GrizzlyBear still reported the following error message:\n\n1. Solution exception:MakeBuilding() takes exactly 3 arguments (1 given)\n\nDid I miss anything? Any help is much appreciated!\n\n\u00a0\n\nDing[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ug6ORo4NSNQYf0ATkAsqiRl*s245Zw3s5t9JWLgH--vTrIwIwGdKkonO2zIJHUxdvewudUGyGho80KENsgh8Mdpz8fJszFlP/5.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ug6ORo4NSNQYf0ATkAsqiRl*s245Zw3s5t9JWLgH--vTrIwIwGdKkonO2zIJHUxdvewudUGyGho80KENsgh8Mdpz8fJszFlP/5.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "June 21, 2014 at 08:48AM", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "topic_1091427", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1091719"}
