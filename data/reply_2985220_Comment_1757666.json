{"body": "\nThank you for the detailed response, Sarith!\n\n\n\nCould you elaborate on why Daysim is not accurate for direct illuminance analysis? Is there any way to run \"pure\" radiance analysis with Rhino/Grasshopper?\n\n\n\nJust to be clear: what you are saying is that one should:\n\n-Minimize (or eliminate) direct solar exposure\n\n-Limit lux-hours\n\nOr are there some additional considerations one might take into account? For example: ere you aware of a way to estimate UV more directly?\n\n\n\nCould you also elaborate on:\n\n\"It will only require averaging these points, extracting them into an array and then summing up that array.\"\u00a0\n\nI do not understand your logic here.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ernst Bay", "created_at": "May 25, 2017 at 6:32am", "created_by": "ErnstBay", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1757339", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1757666"}
