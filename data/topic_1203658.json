{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Chris,\n\ni'm getting into the following situation.\n\nI'm defining Heat/Cool setpoint CSV files that are hooked into the HB_setEPZoneSchedules component.\n\nI run the simulation and it fails but no warnings in the GH environment.\n\nSo i checked the error file produced and i get the following 3 severe ones:\n\n** Severe\u00a0 ** ThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint=\"SHOEBOX_HVAC DUAL SP CONTROL\" invalid Heating Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name=\"C:\\LADYBUG\\EPCSVSCHEDULES\\HEATINGSC.CSV\" not found.\u00a0\u00a0 ** Severe\u00a0 ** ThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint=\"SHOEBOX_HVAC DUAL SP CONTROL\" invalid Cooling Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name=\"C:\\LADYBUG\\EPCSVSCHEDULES\\COOLINGSC.CSV\" not found.\u00a0\u00a0 ** Severe\u00a0 ** GetStagedDualSetpoint: Errors with invalid names in ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint objects.\n\nI looked in the idf file and i noticed that in the HVACTemplate:Thermostat section the heating/cooling schedule names are taken from the CSV files instead from the previously define Schedule:File section. As a result E+ doesn't recognize the schedules. See attached: Left correct definition, right wrong HB definition.\n\nThe fix is easy (i suppose), so, to let you know this small bug.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1203657", "name": "Capture.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 13, 2015 at 9:53am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "invalid Heating.Cooling Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name", "id": "topic_1203658"}
