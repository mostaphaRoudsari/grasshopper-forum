{"body": "\nI realized that the 0,0,1 is the orientation set in the bdsf. Always rushing into things I'm afraid :)\n\n\n\nHowever, after trying to run the analysis I am getting the error \"illegal orientation vector for xxx bdsf\". Now, I have tried every vector and I still get the message.\n\n\n\nI have all of my glazing grouped together atm, and they have different orientations.
