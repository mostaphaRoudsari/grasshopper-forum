{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\n\nI am running a basic test for a shading scheme with advanced shading control:\n\ninterior sensor: on the floor next to the glass (highlighted below)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/MIhWJtLxwsETK-rKNHFq4I50KINk7bE1Hx3-mm6kxA5wOw0am5vvkIXRk6*LyOZ*mQ5hASKvoOlLI46DKnYg2as9orfUsgCL/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/MIhWJtLxwsETK-rKNHFq4I50KINk7bE1Hx3-mm6kxA5wOw0am5vvkIXRk6*LyOZ*mQ5hASKvoOlLI46DKnYg2as9orfUsgCL/Capture.JPG)\n\nShading Group 1 State 1: curtains pulled at the corner, solid surface, reflectance 0.18, when there is NO direct sunlight on the sensor (illuminance&lt;10000 lux).\n\nShading Group 1 State 2: curtains along the glass, trans surface, transmittance 0.2, when there is direct sunlight on the sensor (illuminance&gt;=10000 lux).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/MIhWJtLxwsGaH43GER-n7s9Ha8gAl6vQDRUaYXethnls81JxHjhUX1I*zHXcaz6yh7OFLlRrweB9Yd3T3yj1cqBQpPsUYNwy/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/MIhWJtLxwsGaH43GER-n7s9Ha8gAl6vQDRUaYXethnls81JxHjhUX1I*zHXcaz6yh7OFLlRrweB9Yd3T3yj1cqBQpPsUYNwy/Capture.JPG)\n\nAfter the run I checked the ill files in the folder and the shading schedule in the intgain.csv file and found some inconsistency, taking Jan 1st as an example\n\nIn the intgain.csv, the shading schedule shows the curtain only covers the glass (state 2) at 9.5,11.5,13.5.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/MIhWJtLxwsECRCI*cTZv7StfSGyCSNm0sUnQNpZ-QmgRTyxu4PXfwaolaFo*OyTNsLOZw-fZqSGdb9RHEsOkd4T-OJZHIUKH/Capture.JPG\" width=\"547\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/MIhWJtLxwsECRCI*cTZv7StfSGyCSNm0sUnQNpZ-QmgRTyxu4PXfwaolaFo*OyTNsLOZw-fZqSGdb9RHEsOkd4T-OJZHIUKH/Capture.JPG)\n\n\n\nBut in the ILL file with no dynamic shading, the sensor point (first column after hour) illuminance is above 10000 lux from 10 to 15. **So the shading schedule should be 1 from 9.5 to 14.5, right? Or am I missing something here?**\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/MIhWJtLxwsF8Vml1PPfSXVVVZ6nVpKNtNC*vHZMgX28T016ovDhsThNAMVa4zOvjjCtjGfc-W8GLpj48CI6Co6jD7HdmymIv/Capture.JPG\" width=\"312\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/MIhWJtLxwsF8Vml1PPfSXVVVZ6nVpKNtNC*vHZMgX28T016ovDhsThNAMVa4zOvjjCtjGfc-W8GLpj48CI6Co6jD7HdmymIv/Capture.JPG)\u00a0\n\nI'm trying to get the lux hours/accumulated illuminance for the test point, but there is no ILL file that actually combined the ill, state-1 ill, and state-2 ill together based on the shading schedule? (My understanding is the \"read annual result I\" visualizes the Daylight Autonomy based on the advanced shading schedule but didn't generate another ill file?)\n\nI was doing it in Excel and found the difference between shading schedule and the sensor reading. Please let me know if I made any mistakes in the simulation setting! Any comments on a better data processing method would be much appreciated!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nXF\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "XF", "created_at": "April 06, 2017 at 06:37PM", "created_by": "XF", "topic": "Question about Annual Simulation with Advanced Dynamic Shading", "id": "topic_1728884"}
