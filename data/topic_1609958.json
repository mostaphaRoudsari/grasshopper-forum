{"body": "\nHello everyone,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have been trying to visualize the sunpath shading for a vertical PV surface. The PhotovolaticSurface component seems to be working properly and outputting a reasonable value for ACenergyPerYear... however, I can't get the shading visualization to show up under the SunpathShading component. The surface normal is correct. It works fine with a horizontal surface - has anyone else discovered this problem and been able to make it work?\u00a0\n\n\n\nI attached a couple screen shots of what the sunpathshading looks like with a vertical and horizontal PV surface.\n\n\n\nOutputs, AC Energy per year (I tested a very small surface which is why the value is so low)\n\nHorizontal: 0.022671 kWh\n\nVertical: 0.005322 kWh\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMaria\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1609956", "name": "Horizontal Sunpathshading.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1609957", "name": "Vertical Sunpathshading.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Maria Grimm", "created_at": "October 3, 2016 at 3:38pm", "created_by": "MariaGrimm", "topic": "Vertical PV: Viewing the Sunpath Shading", "id": "topic_1609958"}
