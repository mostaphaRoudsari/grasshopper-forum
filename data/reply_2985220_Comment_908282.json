{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI see that now the azimuth difference is a bit more than 1 degree (1.1 to 1.3). The altitude is quite close.\n\nWhat to do (i think):\n\nFirst, what NOT to do: 2 sunpaths. It will be quite confusing.\n\nAgree that the conversion Local &lt;--&gt; Solar may be confusing. But sometimes user may want to use each of them(SunlightHours vs Radiation, for instance). I would only add an explanation in the Help of the relevant components about the meaning of using Solar vs Local.\n\nWhat may lead to the confusion is that the ImportEPW component has only Latitude output. For Local time you need both Longitude and TimeZone. It is a bit of unconvenient to look for these, and then sometimes user may \"forget\" or miss to input one/both of them into the Sunpath component (as seems to be the case with Stefania ... and me :-) ).\n\nThe DecomposeLocationData component has the 3 outputs and then the correction works. But this component is not included in the released version (v0.0.35). If so, it will difficult to users to catch what to do (input manually the Longitude and TZ).\n\nSo i think the things to do are:\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "September 2, 2013 at 11:46pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_908358", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_908282"}
