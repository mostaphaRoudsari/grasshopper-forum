{"body": "Hi Theodore,\nI usually step on the same problem myself and not only with sketcup models. The esiest workaround for me is to use the \"naked mesh points\" component from Kangaroo or the native \"mesh edges\" component and recreate closed polylines and then surfaces or patches in case of planar meshes. In more complex geometries i triangulate the mesh faces and recreate surfaces from there which is quite intense especially when it comes to large meshes. Finally a workaround that helped me a lot is to input my meshes into \"Create HB surface\" component which will do what you need in most of the cases - it worked for me for meshes even with 4000+ mesh faces but might take some time. After that you can keep the generated surfaces and work with them as you wish. (for example join them into 1 brep)\n\nHope it helps\nTasos", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "December 08, 2015 at 01:19AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "topic_1416973", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1417061"}
