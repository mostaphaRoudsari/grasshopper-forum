{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI am trying to make make transparent interior walls. I've tried use the interior window construction as an alternative constuction input in the solve adjacencies component. Also I've tried a custom glass construction as an alternative construction. Both options however give severe errors when running energy-plus. The warnings state that glass is not allowed for a wall surface.\u00a0\n\nDoes anyone have suggestion of how I go about modelin this the right way? I couldn't find any previous discussions on this topic.\u00a0\n\n\n\nGr,\n\n\n\nSam\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Samuel de Vries", "created_at": "June 23, 2015 at 04:55PM", "created_by": "SamueldeVries", "topic": "Glass interior walls", "id": "topic_1314460"}
