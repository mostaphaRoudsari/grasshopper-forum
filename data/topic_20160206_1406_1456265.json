{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm having the following error with the HB_IndoorViewFactor:\n\n1. One of your continuous closed air volumes has an overlapping edge that is causing it to not read as a solid. <br/>\u00a0Bake the closedAirVolumes output and do a DupBorder command on the polysurface to see the buggy edge. <br/>\u00a0Rhino's solid operations are buggy. Hopefully McNeel fix this one soon.\n\nI'm doing the recommendation, baking the Closed Zones and doing the Dupborder command in Rhino, but no use. No duplicate borders found.\n\n\n\nUsing the new (and fantastic) new component HB_loadHBObjects, to make thinks easy to follow, i'm attaching the saved geometry and the GH for debug.\n\n\n\nAny ideas and/or recommendations how to solve this?\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1456263", "name": "Saba_HB"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1456264", "name": "IndoorViewFactor_issue.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 06, 2016 at 02:06PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "IndoorViewFactor Duplicate border issue", "id": "topic_1456265"}
