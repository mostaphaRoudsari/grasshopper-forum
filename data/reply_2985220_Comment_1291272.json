{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nCan't open the file from here but I did run into this error (number 2) recently myself. Hope my response is relevant.\n\n\n\nThe dupborder command did recognise the problem (highlighted the edges). What I did to fix it was to use the native merge command in Rhino for the two surfaces of the border highlighted. I then refreshed the breps and that closed my volume.\n\n\n\nDon't know if that helps.\n\n\n\nP.S.: Are you using a glazing by ratio component? Found that it also breaks volumes sometimes.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 21, 2015 at 3:25am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1291169", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1291272"}
