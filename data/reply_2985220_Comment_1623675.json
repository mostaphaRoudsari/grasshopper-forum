{"body": "\nPhew!\n\nMan, this bug was like finding a needle in a haystack! \u00a0It was just one little line that needed changing but the bug only affected cases where you have several air walls between zones, which made it so hard for me to replicate on a smaller scale. \u00a0It really required a file of this size and created surface-by-surface to replicate.\n\nTo be clear, the bug was in the OpenStudio component in that it was only writing out a single mixing object for each zone instead of the multiple objects needed to model cross-mixing of air in between zones.\n\n\n\nThis bug has been fixed here:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/f12da7f6534bb49...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/f12da7f6534bb491552d80b3c79760ba5190b09c)\n\n.. and in the attached file.\n\n\n\nThank you again, Abraham and Mostapha, for your persistence with addressing this issue. \u00a0As they say, any computer issue is solve-able with enough perseverance. \u00a0I am happy to finally say that this case is closed!\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1623676", "name": "munotoA115.09.16ASHRAEEU_AY_Updt_FIXED.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 23, 2016 at 11:38am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1623669", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1623675"}
