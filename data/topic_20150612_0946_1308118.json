{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to run the OUT_SET calculation using the Ladybug_PMV Comfort Calculator but I'm getting an error message saying 'The calculation has been terminated by the user!'.\n\n\n\nI'm using a weather file from Doha, Qatar with a metabolic rate of 1.4 and clothing index of 0.9. The component works when met is reduced to 1.0 so I assume there's an out of range number being calculated somewhere in the code.\n\n\n\nI've updated the component to the 28th February version as referenced in this thread:\n\n\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/set-comfort...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/set-comfort-error-when-analysis-period-grater-than-5-months)\n\n\n\nAny ideas why the code is rejecting the inputs?\n\n\n\nThanks,<br/><br/>Dan.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Jestico", "created_at": "June 12, 2015 at 09:46AM", "created_by": "DanJestico", "topic": "OUT_SET issues", "id": "topic_1308118"}
