{"body": "\nFrehel,\n\nThis is an interesting question. \u00a0Air temperature and wind speed you get from the EPW file. \u00a0To get surface temperatures, the best suggestion that I have is what Mostapha mentioned: you create a HBZone that is covered in your material and look at the hourly surface temperatures that you get out of the simulation.\n\nEventually, there may be a simpler workflow as I am currently working on a couple of components to help estimate surface temperatures given steady state assumptions. \u00a0I have not yet put in the ability to account for direct sun yet, though, and I don't know if the movement of the sun across the sky means that such a steady state estimate would be too inaccurate. \u00a0In the meantime, the transient E+ simulation is your best bet.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 27, 2016 at 1:40pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1588898", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1589447"}
