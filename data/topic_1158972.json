{"body": "\nI am trying to simulate a building which has 4 office towers, three spaces which connect the towers, southern and eastern corridors/egress, and a podium which the aforementioned massing sits upon. I have created each of these as a separate piece of geometry and each can be independently run through EnergyPlus, however my intent is to run all of them as a whole building. I have not been able to do this yet due to the fact that when I intersect the separate masses to ensure that the surfaces are divided properly I am unable to proceed in the simulation workflow because I am getting a \"Solution Exception: NoneType object has no attribute 'Centroid'\" error.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat could I be doing wrong such that I am getting this error? I have attached my files for reference.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks for the help, I really appreciate it.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1158970", "name": "Ennead Staten Island Courthouse.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1158971", "name": "Experiement - Staten Island Courthouse.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Nicholas Rekstad", "created_at": "October 30, 2014 at 10:05pm", "created_by": "NicholasRekstad", "topic": "Honeybee | Honeybee_Intersect Masses is removing the centroid of my geometries", "id": "topic_1158972"}
