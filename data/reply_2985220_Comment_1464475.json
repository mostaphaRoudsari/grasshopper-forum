{"body": "\nHi Sarith,\n\nWhat do you think about implementing photon mapping to Honeybee as an option for image-based analysis? What do you think will be the major issues?\n\nI have no experience in using PhotonMapping but based on the presentations I think our main challenge is to open up access to available parameters ([page 7 and 8 from David's presentation](http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2015-philadelphia/presentations/day1/Geisler-Moroder_PhotonMapApplications.pdf)) and set them to the best practice. I also think we need proper warnings for the cases which sort of follows Greg's slide in choosing the best method.\n\nThanks! I'm learning lots of new stuff in the areas that I always wanted to learn more about them by reading your posts.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 16, 2016 at 11:49am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1464072", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1464475"}
