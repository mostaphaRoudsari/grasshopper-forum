{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n<br/>Thank you for this post, We all proud of you.\n\n<br/>For one\u00a0educational\u00a0project, I am trying to evaluate the effect of thick water wall on\u00a0daylight distribution\u00a0inside a room. (as you know it is not possible with glass material)\n\nthis water wall is oriented to the south with thickness about 25 cm.\n\nI have defined a dielectric material in radiance for\u00a0Water as\u00a0this:\n\nvoid dielectric Water\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5 0.8695 0.8695 0.8695 1.33 0\n\n#red_transmissivity \u00a0green_transmissivity \u00a0 blue_transmissivity \u00a0 index_of_refraction \u00a0 0\n\nTherefore, I defined 2 surfaces for front and back and since there is just one layer of dielectric, I don't need using any interface material.\u00a0But the direction of these surface is very tricky. both directions have to be toward outside (?)\n\nshould I rotate them inside in reverse ray tracing??? \u00a0The resultant values are significantly different.\n\n\n\nany comments would be really helpful for me.\u00a0<br/>thanks in advance.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Fazel Ganji", "created_at": "March 29, 2016 at 1:36am", "created_by": "fazelganji", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1404652", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1494592"}
