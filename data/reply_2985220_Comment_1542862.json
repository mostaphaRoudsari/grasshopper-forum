{"body": "\nHi all,<br/><br/>So I've tried to install LB + HB as it is described in here: <br/><br/>[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/resources/I...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/resources/Installation_Instructions.md). <br/><br/>Step by step. A long time ago I installed it without any problems. <br/>But today, unfortunately, I have a huge one. <br/>There aren't any of tabs in toolbar menu. <br/>I've checked, everything is unlock. (GHPython is working, my Rhino and GH are up to date)<br/>I don't have any clue what is wrong. <br/><br/>HELP! Please :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Agnieszka Szczepa\u0144ska", "created_at": "June 6, 2016 at 1:15pm", "created_by": "AgnieszkaSzczepanska", "parent_id": "topic_966496", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1542862"}
