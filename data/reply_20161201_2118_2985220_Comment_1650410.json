{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nYes. This answers the question. We have airwalls between the zones, and so i was thinking something like this can explain the output meshes.\n\nThough, what we want from the evaluations is to get the percentage of comfort per room. The continuous mesh messes this a bit. See the zone in the middle (is a corridor) which became a small square at the bottom (but also the other 2 that doesn't corresponf to the original zones).\n\nOK. Thanks again. I understand the situation.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 01, 2016 at 09:18PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1650275", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1650410"}
