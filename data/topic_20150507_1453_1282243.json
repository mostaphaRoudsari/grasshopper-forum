{"body": "\nChris and Mostapha,\n\n\n\nCould you please advice on how I could include the context as a factor that influences the results of energy consumptions when running an energy analysis with honeybee?\n\n\n\nI assume there should be two different \"types\" of context:\n\nOne that touches the building and should be defined as some other type of energy zone? And the second that doesn't and would effect the light in my building's energy zones, thus effecting the energy consumption.\n\n\n\nAttached an image of the case study I am trying to apply this logic.\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1282242", "name": "Energy_Context.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "May 07, 2015 at 02:53PM", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Context impact on energy analysis", "id": "topic_1282243"}
