{"body": "\nDennis,\n\nI don't understand what is what you want to analyze, so can't suggest anything. So i go for making your example work.\n\nFor starters your model units were in feet. I believe you need to work in meters (or at least this is the recommendation). I did it and i can see the model is a small box ...\n\nI need to say also that the size of the windows is tiny. In this case i don't think tiny is good. Probably you are doing this task parametrically.\n\nThe following thing is that you set the whole model for the test points. I'm not sure if this makes a good sense and you intended in this way. I selected the floor and used only it as the test surface.\n\nAdded a few components to the right to visualize results and updated some others.\n\n\n\nHope it helps.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1175552", "name": "new_A.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 25, 2014 at 11:47am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1175400", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1175550"}
