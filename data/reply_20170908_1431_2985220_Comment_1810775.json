{"body": "\nThank you, Chris, yes I think Ladybug\u00a0results are more precise and easier.\n\nI need help from @Djordje if he is available.\n\nI have a multistory building consisting of 23 floors, three orientations (East, South, &amp; West) have two-axis tracking shading devices integrated with PV. Not all the three elevations will receive direct sun radiation at once, also there will be self-shading and building shading affecting the PV panels. How should I model the panels and perform simulations?\n\nThe attached figures elaborate the idea. Each facade per a floor has 7 panels (2.15m X 2m) as presented in the second figure.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Tltc7mC*TU0kcd3Ys7l3kOAuh4hZm9HlpySmVlZHrp1NBJmdDO89LYNGC1Zzuo6SwPL1F7fF4kKcCw0NoZ8aU-53USJHexIi/F.jpg?width=369\" width=\"369\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Tltc7mC*TU0kcd3Ys7l3kOAuh4hZm9HlpySmVlZHrp1NBJmdDO89LYNGC1Zzuo6SwPL1F7fF4kKcCw0NoZ8aU-53USJHexIi/F.jpg)\u00a0[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Tltc7mC*TU2RSardH5KhQd72gsgOrV*t31mxDoG0FoS0SiImcDOopnwjufRwE*0ddDtRwQh99ZXHVzLm5ipILsJ3rFX*13ev/Ff.jpg\" width=\"283\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Tltc7mC*TU2RSardH5KhQd72gsgOrV*t31mxDoG0FoS0SiImcDOopnwjufRwE*0ddDtRwQh99ZXHVzLm5ipILsJ3rFX*13ev/Ff.jpg)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hardi Barznji", "created_at": "September 08, 2017 at 02:31PM", "created_by": "HardiBarznji", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810924", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810775"}
