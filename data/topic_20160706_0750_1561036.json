{"body": "\nFor a certain project, I needed to create a monthly line chart instead of the default bar chart that LB - Make Bar Chart component creates. The way to do it was use the data label pts output and put it into a polyline GH component. Firstly,it would be helpful to have that option within the component?\u00a0\n\nBut the problem I was facing was that since the dataLabelPts is really to add data labels, it had an factor added to move the labels above the bar charts (image : 1.jpg) . Since I wanted to depict the line chart with exact values, I removed the factor (+(yS/conversionFac) ) from the python script and it worked. (image : 2.jpeg)\n\nI am thinking if this would be worth incorporating into the component?\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1561034", "name": "1.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1561035", "name": "2.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Apoorv Goyal", "created_at": "July 06, 2016 at 07:50AM", "created_by": "ApoorvGoyal", "topic": "Line Graphs from Bar Chart Component", "id": "topic_1561036"}
