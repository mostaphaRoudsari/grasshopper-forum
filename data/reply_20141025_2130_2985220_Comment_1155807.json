{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nChris, There are two versions of genskymtx and 21kb is the newer version ([https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.b.0](https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.b.0)). Can you check and let me know what is the error that happens on your system with the newer version?\n\nI wanted to send a post and ask everyone to update their Radiance to the newest version (4.3.a) which has the recent bug with pfilt fixed but before I do that can you install the newest radiance, copy gendaymtx from c:\\radiance\\bin to ladybug folder and let me know if it works fine on your system. You can download it from here: ([https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.3.a.1](https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.3.a.1))\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 25, 2014 at 09:30PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1155415", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1155807"}
