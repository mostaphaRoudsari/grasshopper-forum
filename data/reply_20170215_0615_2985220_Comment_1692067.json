{"body": "\nHi Julia,\n\nthanks a lot for your reply.\n\nBut i think that you workflow can just change the color of the maps, right?\n\nWhat i want is to assign a color for a range of values of DF .\n\ni.e.:\n\nfor the DF\u00a0below 0.7 --&gt; red\n\nfor the DF between\u00a00.7 -\u00a02.2 --&gt; orange\n\nfor the DF between\u00a02.2 -\u00a03.6 --&gt; yellow\n\nfor the DF between\u00a03.6 -\u00a05.4 --&gt; green\n\nfor the DF up to 5.4 --&gt; white\n\nI don't think i can do it with your workflow. Am i wrong? I hope so!\n\nThanks\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "February 15, 2017 at 06:15AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1691782", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1692067"}
