{"body": "\nAbraham,Thanks again, I should credit some of my work to you :) .\n\nI took a look at the the Pollination tool and I have to admit it is awesome. I ran Octopus since last night and I connected 12 lists of data that I wanted to export to the pollination component as a data tree with branches. additionally I connected the file name to a slider, so I can keep each configuration to a separate file. Pollination created .csv files, the files have 12 different data separated by comma, however,pollination recorded the first value in the list, for example I have an hourly list of mean radiant temp. that list has over 8000 values, in the .csv I get one value from this list, I'm guessing it is the first value in the list. Another example, I have a daylighting autonomy list that has about 300 values (the grid nodes values) and again in the .csv file I see only one value. Is it supposed to be this way?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nRania\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "March 22, 2015 at 12:52pm", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "topic_1247620", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1247865"}
