{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nI originally tried to respond to this issue by editing my ZoneShades component to accommodate mid-plane blinds but I was not successful. \u00a0This is because, when you do just interior or exterior blinds, the glazing construction does not need to include the blind material. \u00a0All that I need to write into the IDF is the blind material and the ShadingControl object and I leave the window construction alone. \u00a0For the mid-plane blind, I would need to edit the whole window construction inside the component, which is difficult to do.\n\nAn idea just popped into my mind, perhaps if the user inputs a full window construction for the blind material, I can have the component recognize it as an mid-plane blind construction and only write the shading control object into the IDF. \u00a0Does this sound like a good way to implement it? \u00a0Most of the other inputs of the ZoneShades component would have to go blank and the geometry preview of what the shades look like would be blank because the user would \u00a0define the angle and width of the shades in the material layer component. \u00a0But you would be able to use the component to assign the schedule.\n\nLet me know if this sounds good and, if so, I will try to implement it soon.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 10, 2014 at 11:10pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1185915", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1185917"}
