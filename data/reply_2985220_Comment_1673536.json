{"body": "\nDevang,\n\nthank you for indicating me this thing. Actually (also in this case) I remembered in a different way but now I see that the tooltip says:\n\ntotalSunlightHours\n\nThe average number of hours of direct sunlight received by the test _geometry.\n\n\n\nSo it doesn't mention the surface area of the meshes.
