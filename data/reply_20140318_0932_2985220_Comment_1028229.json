{"body": "\nMostapha, let me ask you few practical questions:\n\nFor daylight analysis, it is important to use the skylight and not direct sunlight?\n\nIs is possible to visualize the sky which is used for analysis?\n\nHow many light bounces are used (or should be used) for daylight analysis? (Since I have seen you can change rad analysis parameters)\n\nI hope this questions are not too banal.\n\nRegards,\n\nPetar\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Petar Pejic", "created_at": "March 18, 2014 at 09:32AM", "created_by": "PetarPejic", "parent_id": "topic_1024838", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1028229"}
