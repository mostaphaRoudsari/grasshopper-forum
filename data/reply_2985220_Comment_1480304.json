{"body": "\nHi Chris and Grasshope,\n\n\n\nI am still having the same problem Grasshope described in the first post here but have not been able to resolve it in the way that Grasshope did. I have tried everything from the above but to no avail. The files I get from GitHub are still only 36kB for me (or thereabouts) and they do not increase if I get Honeybee_honeybee to download them itself.\n\n\n\nBy the way, I have noted that there is no consistency in when Honeybee_honeybee will automatically download the files as it will not do it always if they are not there but so far it only does it for me if I had imported\u00a0Honeybee_honeybee (not working and no files there) then manually add the files, then delete and re-import\u00a0Honeybee_honeybee (not working), delete files (after Grasshope's posts), then delete and re-import\u00a0Honeybee_honeybee and then it automatically downloads them but it still doesn't work (gives same message about missing file) and files are still around 36 kB.\n\n\n\nThe only clue I have to move forward is that my Honeybee version is 0.0.59 and I see from screenshots that Grasshope was using 0.0.57. I also see that Chris has recently changed the EP structures file on GitHub only a month ago.\n\n\n\nI will try re-installing an older version of Honeybee but I don't see version 0.0.57 there, only 0.0.56 and 0.0.58. Which one is best for this purpose and for the new updated Vertical Sky Component to work?\n\n\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!\n\nAlex\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alexander Giarlis", "created_at": "March 9, 2016 at 6:46am", "created_by": "AlexanderGiarlis", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1373474", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1480304"}
