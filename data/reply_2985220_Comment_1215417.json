{"body": "\nThanks Chris,\n\nMore questions here:\n\nAnswer b: i know they are not schedules but the only section i'm getting under ZoneAirflow is the Infiltration. So i suppose i'm missing some other definition in order to enable this ventilation. Attached the file, updated to today's version.\n\nAdded the Economizer, but also it is not making any difference in the IDF. I'm not talking about the results but about the definitions in the IDF file. Again, I'm missing something for sure.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1215418", "name": "HB_shoeboxing_CWM_AY_Resid_ORG.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 2, 2015 at 12:13am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1214900", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1215417"}
