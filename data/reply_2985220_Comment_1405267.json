{"body": "\nEDIT<br/>I created a new topic on this question since it isnt related to PV-components..<br/>Thanks!Well, I realize that it is indeed the geometry. However it is because HB_context surfaces component splits some of the panels in two, increasing the number of panels - which have half the area - and thus creating the errors in the e+ simulation.When i merge everything into 43 surfaces going into the context surfaces component it still splits some of them up.is this a bug?Will i loose e+ information associated with each surface if i merge them together again after the context geometry component?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 7:30am", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1403541", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1405267"}
