{"body": "\nHi Theodore, I'm very interested in the topic of using agent-based modeling for behavioral modeling. One of the main issues for integrating similar features in energyplus is the difficulties to tap into the simulation during the run. I think we need to get into EMS for making any solutions similar to this to work. I have never played with EMS but it looks like one of those things that will be easy once you figure it out once. EnergyPlus developers are very good in developing not user-friendly workflows.\n\nInterestingly enough I know 2 of the current developers of MLE+. I'm currently working with them on a different project. I didn't know that they are currently involved in MLE+. I can also ask them about their approach next time that I see them in person (will be early next year). Looks like they have made so many changes during the last 5 years which was the last time that I tried MLE+.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 23, 2015 at 02:15PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1425051", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1426044"}
