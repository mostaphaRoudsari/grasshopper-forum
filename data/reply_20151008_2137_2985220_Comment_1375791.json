{"body": "\nClaudio,\n\nYou need to be aware o fthe changes in the software (in this case E+). Maybe it is changing something that will affect your results ad this can be very bad/good. Usually before the update i do some tests to see if i get different results. In such\u00a0 case i try to understand why it happens and/or if the changes are significant.\n\nIf you are a developer first thing you need to know if the new version is changing the format (or otherwise things) of the IDF so you can release updates of your own software that will be able to run the new version (in this case HB).\n\nJust to clarify your last sentence. Weather files are not updating with E+. Unless new standards in those files they are the same through time.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 08, 2015 at 09:37PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1375783", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1375791"}
