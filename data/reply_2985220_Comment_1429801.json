{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nDoes the new component feature thermochromic support?\n\n\n\nThe implemention of thermochromic glazing in E+ seems straightforward enough, but its extensive nature (a different material for each of the temperatures) makes their custom creation quite painfull.\n\n\n\nAt the moment, I am guessing because I haven't tried yet,\u00a0 we could use the BSDF export in WindowsLBNL on their thermochromic materials for Daylight simulations? I wonder how close we are to providing the functionality in HB for Energy simulations (if we are not there already and I missed it!).\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 4, 2016 at 1:28am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1416603", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1429801"}
