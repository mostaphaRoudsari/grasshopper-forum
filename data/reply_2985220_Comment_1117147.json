{"body": "\nHi Reinier,\n\nCheck Honeybee example file for grid-based analysis. There is a component at down left that does what you are looking for. I made it based on David Rutten's example. You can connect one or multiple sliders to the component and it will iterate between all possible combinations.\n\nIf you have TT-Toolbox plugin installed there is a Brute-Force component that also does this. Good luck with your studies and let me know if you have any other question.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 15, 2014 at 4:50pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1117129", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1117147"}
