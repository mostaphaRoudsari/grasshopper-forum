{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nThank you for letting me know. \u00a0It seems that the Rhino files were not exported because I was using a very old version of the Hydra component. \u00a0I will try to fix this when I get the chance but, in the meantime, both example files should have the geometry internalized.\n\nThe \"Create Therm Polygons\" component is meant to accept either EP or THERM materials and this is what is demonstrated in the example file. \u00a0Are you saying that you do not see the THERM polygon components like so when you open the file?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DYswKX9FwiSYNIS8Eex2EbDvfAqPyMvEE0uAWVwUWzIWKFR64lHiltIxf8EqzpzoxFsy7WIMCC7nbeGn33GnVXfUNzBinOFi/EPMAterialsWithTherm.JPG\" width=\"688\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DYswKX9FwiSYNIS8Eex2EbDvfAqPyMvEE0uAWVwUWzIWKFR64lHiltIxf8EqzpzoxFsy7WIMCC7nbeGn33GnVXfUNzBinOFi/EPMAterialsWithTherm.JPG)\n\nAs you see, the \"M01 100MM BRICK\", \"8IN CONCRETE HW\" and \"1/2IN GYPSUM\" are EP materials. \u00a0If you do not see the Therm Polygon components like to, it's a problem that is specific to your system and you will have to send me the error message.\n\nAnother guess, which may be far off from the issue, is that you might be connecting EP Constructions and not EP Materials?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 2, 2016 at 11:24pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1429389", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1429394"}
