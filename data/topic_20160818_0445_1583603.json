{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nIn anticipation of the first public release of Butterfly I would like to share a small definition that can hopefully get people started and allow some experimentation with Butterfly.\n\n\n\nThis definition is designed for an outdoor study (an indoor example will follow shortly). It also includes a hopefully more user friendly UI that allows the user to set all the necessary inputs for the simulation and run the case without using the actual GH definition.\n\nTo use this example to its full extent, along with Butterfly (details on installations can be found here [https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly/wiki/Getting-Started-...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly/wiki/Getting-Started-with-butterfly)) you will also need the HumanUI tools ([http://www.food4rhino.com/project/human-ui?ufh](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/human-ui?ufh)). However, HUI isn't necessary if you are only interested in the BF part of the definition which will still run.\n\n\n\nButterfly, and the example itself, is still a work in progress. I hope it can inspire people to get involved, test things out, and help it improve!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\nP.S.: Add the path of the attached butterfly logo's location in your computer in the definition for a more buggy feeling :)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1583601", "name": "160818_Butterfly&HumanUI_OutdoorCFD.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1583602", "name": "butterfly_100px.png"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "August 18, 2016 at 04:45AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Butterfly and HumanUI: an outdoor CFD example", "id": "topic_1583603"}
