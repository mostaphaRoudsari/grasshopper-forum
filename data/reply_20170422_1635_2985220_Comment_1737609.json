{"body": "\nFilippo,\n\nYour interpretation of the Hydra example file is correct. \u00a0I admittedly over-complicated the hydra example file a bit by trying to change only one material in a 5-layer construction. \u00a0I did this so that I could preserve the effects of thermal mass in the construction by keeping the other 4 layers. \u00a0However, you can probably just substitute the whole wall construction with a single NoMass Material construction that has an R-Value that matches that of the THERM model U-Value (minus air films). \u00a0This should be good enough if you just want to understand the impact of the thermal bridge on energy use.\n\nFor your case, I would use two separate HBSrfs to model the above-grade wall in E+: one that has a thermally-bridged construction derived from THERM and another that has the typical construction (without the effect of the floor slab). \u00a0The height above the ground that you make the thermally bridged HBSrf should match the height of the above-grade portion in your THERM model. \u00a0I wouldn't worry too much about accounting for thermal bridges in your below-grade zone as E+ models ground zones without much envelope heat loss by default (it assumes a constant ground temperature of 18C).\n\nSo I would say your first hypothesis is sufficient but breaking the above-grade wall surface into two surfaces will give you the most accurate model.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 22, 2017 at 04:35PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1736763", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1737609"}
