{"body": "\nHello Chris,\n\nThank you so much for your thorough reply and the model! It helps me a lot! One thing that I need to clarify is that, for point 2 about the setpoint temperature, you didn't say that in any of your video. I just saw it once in the reply of one question in our forum and maybe it was not your reply, so I am so sorry for my misleading\u00a0statement. It was not your mistake at all!<br/>Thanks again for all your help and the amazing software and all the videos!\n\nCheers,\n\nYao\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yao Lv", "created_at": "August 05, 2015 at 04:21AM", "created_by": "YaoLv", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1326743", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1338401"}
