{"body": "\nOne other thing that could work is to use pollination as a post process tool.\n\n\n\nWhat if you could create another automation process of not running energy simulations but instead opening them after they are finished, ony-by-one, from their respective folders, loading their results with the zone/surface components and then recording those results with pollination.\n\n\n\nJust thinking out loud, haven't tried to design it. Seems like a waste to use it after the fact and I'm sure someone can think of a more elegant solution but it could still save you a lot of post processing time.\n\n\n\nTheodore\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 10:44pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447892", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448030"}
