{"body": "\nHi Mona,\n\nThere have been some known issues with epw files generated with CC World Gen. \u00a0See this discussion:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/impossible-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/impossible-to-visualize-weather-data-from-epw-ipcc-scenario-a2?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1183831&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\n\n\n\nThere seem to be a lot of weird bugs in the excel file such that it outputs this weird set of question marks that I see in your file:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vshXEK8U-ig7rQnC6Q9fZqX64U-R9qZJwt15*p5-lefCgX8tTp-2OOkZ9JF5pQgVLRkocPW*O6uOpDCxHNbOjrVHcrF-MSWl/WeirdEPWFile.PNG\" width=\"637\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vshXEK8U-ig7rQnC6Q9fZqX64U-R9qZJwt15*p5-lefCgX8tTp-2OOkZ9JF5pQgVLRkocPW*O6uOpDCxHNbOjrVHcrF-MSWl/WeirdEPWFile.PNG)\n\nMy inference is that EnergyPlus is not running correctly because of this. \u00a0What does the report out of the \"Run Energy Simulation\" component say in your case?\n\nSomeone really needs to write a new version of CC World Gen that is in an actual computer language. \u00a0I might attempt this if there are no updates on the project after a half-year or so.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 23, 2015 at 07:04PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1229760", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1230392"}
