{"body": "\nHi all,\u00a0\n\nI am having some trouble running an annual glare simulation with the honeybee daysim components. Maybe someone can help me figure out what the problem is.\u00a0\n\nWhen I launch the simulation it gives me the following error message:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/JcikeZL6OiIvR6vhjJ94PDa2l26N2TbfI0kmzZarkvgwjCqMMNN*v8308knWQIVxjd8m8Xyji1zYEmUkRp5b38UVv21k-6lZ/Capture.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/JcikeZL6OiIvR6vhjJ94PDa2l26N2TbfI0kmzZarkvgwjCqMMNN*v8308knWQIVxjd8m8Xyji1zYEmUkRp5b38UVv21k-6lZ/Capture.PNG)\n\n\n\nIt seems like it is not creating the sky or something.\u00a0\n\nAm I doing something wrong?
