{"body": "\nInterestingly enough EnergyPlus doesn't change reflectance based on transmittance schedule! It stays the same regardless. That's one of the reasons that I was initially so skeptical about implementing it into Honeybee. It can get people pretty confused.\n\n\n\n[Note that a shadowing transmittance schedule (ref: Shading Surfaces, Field: Transmittance Schedule Name) can be used with a reflective shading surface. **However, EnergyPlus assumes that the reflectance properties of the shading surface are constant even if the transmittance varies**](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-1/input-output-reference/page-011.html#shadingpropertyreflectance)<br/>\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 9, 2016 at 9:32pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1526787", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1526889"}
