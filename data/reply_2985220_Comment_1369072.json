{"body": "\nEchoing much of what Chris mentioned,having Python get access to the Radiance binaries and library files by looking into PATH and RAYPATH (through os.environ I assume) is a great idea if one can ensure that python gets to the binaries distributed by NREL.\n\nHowever, a lot really depends on the order in which Radiance, DIVA, DAYSIM etc. were installed. I have run into issues with Daysim in the past, so much so that I now start DAYSIM with a batch file that first sets the PATH and RAYPATH variables before launching the Daysim interface.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "September 26, 2015 at 3:24pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1367658", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1369072"}
