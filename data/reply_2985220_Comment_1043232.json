{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThank you indeed for the response. The new options added to the component are critical once analyzing a considerable number (over five hundred images) of luminance distribution images and saves a lot of time avoiding the hassle of making such adjustments individually for every single image through the wxfalsecolor interface. I believe such features significantly accelerate the workflow of lighting analysis for projects dealing with numerous point-in-time luminance distribution images.\n\nI wanted to ask for a couple of other options that are both available through the interface of wxfalsecolor. I hope this would not be too much to ask and would not be time-consuming to integrate with the Honeybee falsecolor components:\n\n\n\n1) would it be possible to have the option to save the generated false color image with PNG format? There are components already for conversion to TIFF and GIF formats. However, the PNG is not one of them. The PNG format would be helpful especially for web-based layouts.\n\n2) would it be possible to integrate the masking feature with the Honeybee-falsecolor component? It is available on wxfalsecolor and allows the user to replace the areas with luminance values below a certain threshold with a black region. Therefore, instead of the pink-purple background, as you can see in your image, we will have a black region. I have added a link to the specified feature for further reference:\n\n[Background Masking](https://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/falsecolor2)\n\n\n\nI appreciate indeed all the great effort put into these components.\n\nThanks,\n\nAlireza\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alireza", "created_at": "April 12, 2014 at 3:28pm", "created_by": "Alireza", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1043126", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1043232"}
