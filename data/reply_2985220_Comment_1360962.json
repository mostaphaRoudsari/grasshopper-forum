{"body": "\nHi Chris, We may talk about the same approach. We already have a method that copies a HBZone (callFromHive). We only need to apply a transform function for geometries and update geometry related data for HBZone and HBSurfaces. At the same time there are properties that cannot be copied along such as adjacency. User needs to be notified about that after each transformation. I will create a prototype and upload it here so you and Theodore can check and give me your feedback.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 13, 2015 at 11:04pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1360895", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1360962"}
