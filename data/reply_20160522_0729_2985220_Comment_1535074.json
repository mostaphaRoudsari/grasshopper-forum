{"body": "\nI am sorry for not replying back quickly because I was working on my thesis and other university class related works. Meantime, I was playing with the definition you have given me last time which works very perfect for the particular case I asked.\n\nNow I am little bit curious about how the Ladybug_Sunpath Shading (SunpathShading) component works. Does _analysisGeometry input only require PV panel surfaces? It seems like Points and normal Surfaces could also work according to its description.\n\nAnd my main question is that how does Ladybug_Photovoltaics Surface (PhotovoltaicsSurface) take an account of surrounding obstacles which could potentially makes a shade on the analysis geometry.\n\nIn this example, the upper floor geometry will make a shadow on the lower floor of a fa\u00e7ade that includes the PV I am going to test. In that case, do I have to connect the upper floor fa\u00e7ade geometry as a context_ input? Or does the component itself will understand the whole geometry and calculate shading automatically that it would influence the outputs such as ACenergyPerYear?\n\nThank you very much for your time and concern.<br/> Looking forward to hear from you.<br/> <br/> <br/> Amaraa\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "May 22, 2016 at 07:29AM", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1497735", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535074"}
