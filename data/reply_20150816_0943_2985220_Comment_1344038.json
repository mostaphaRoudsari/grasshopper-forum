{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nThis is a different issue but update. The warning is telling you to let the LB fly first.\n\nFor those cases just select the LB_LB and HB_HB and send them to the back (ctrl+B). And save the file. Next time you open the file it should execute FIRST KB_LB and HB_HB so the other components won't complain.\n\nIf you stay in the same session, disable/enable LB (ctrl+E) and then do the same for the importEPW (and other that are complaining about letting LB fly).\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 16, 2015 at 09:43AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1344122", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1344038"}
