{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI'm going to calculate\u00a0annual glare for 100 Rhino views. I would like to create 100 batch file so I can run them parallel\u00a0on a server that has 128 CPUs. I have two questions:\n\n\n\n1- What is the best way to create 100 batch files, one for each view?\n\nThe only thing I can think of is to create a list of the names of my views and connect it to \"list item component\" then animate the item index slider. However, each time the slider moves simulation starts then I close the Dos window to get a batch file, this means I have to close 100 windows (one at a time). Is there any way Honeybee can write batch files without running simulations.\n\n\n\n2- I read somewhere that Radiance uses 1 processor, Does this means that I can run all 100 batch files simultaneously on a server that has at least 100 CPUs and get results in a speedy manner?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nRania\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "August 03, 2016 at 08:55PM", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "topic": "Create multiple batch files so I can run them parallel on a 128-processor server", "id": "topic_1576412"}
