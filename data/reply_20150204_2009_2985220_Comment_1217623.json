{"body": "\nHi Helena,\n\n\n\nFor your first point I think it has to do with the type of surfaces the component can accept. It seems to be similar to shade benefit evaluation, so only surfaces will do (i.e. no meshes or polysurfaces on the brep geometry). You seem to have one polysurface selected (the right side of your building). I changed that to a simple surface and it seems to work.\n\n\n\nI'm attaching the files. By the way I changed the weather file and took away some of the inputs, you should revert to your settings.\n\n\n\nEdit: By works I meant the error is not showing anymore. Not really sure it works as I haven't used any of these components yet.\n\n\n\nHope this works.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1217625", "name": "ShadowStudy_test_surfaces.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1217626", "name": "SolarStudy_HZ_extruded_surface.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 04, 2015 at 08:09PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1217383", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1217623"}
