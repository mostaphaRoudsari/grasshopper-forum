{"body": "\nHello everyone,\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs most of you probably know, E+ v8.6.0 is out and it brings a few interesting improvements over previous versions. One that caught my eye and would like to start a discussion on how it can be implemented in Honeybee (if not already there with additionalParams). I would love the feedback of the more experienced users here.\n\n\n\nThe change refers to the the Daylighting:Controls object ([https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/5725](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/5725)). As most of you know until now this allowed for 'only' 2 reference points per zone, something that led most of us to manually split zones when we wanted a more detailed design of daylight zones and assessment of the impact of daylight control strategies. This is now changing with two new objects replacing the previous one:\n\n\n\n- Daylighting:DELight:Controls\n\n- Daylighting:DeLight:ReferencePoint\n\n\n\nThe extension of the single object to two now allows for as many reference points as the user wants! I was wondering if this will work out of the box with Honeybee. Does it make any sense to now include this capability in an input of a component, for example using the output of the HB grid points component to quickly define control points on a surface/zone? \u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "October 1, 2016 at 3:57pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "EnergyPlus v8.6.0 - Daylighting Control", "id": "topic_1609080"}
