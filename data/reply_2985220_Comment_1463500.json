{"body": "\nAbraham,\u00a0\n\nI would think that even though the adaptive comfort model is relatively new it should be applicable regardless of time...as people haven't changed physiologically, so comfort today should be the same as comfort yesterday.\u00a0\n\nHowever, getting a hold of actual climate records would definitely provide a more accurate assessment, with the adaptive model or any other.\u00a0\n\nI have no way of looking at the code atm, but I suppose a \"tolerance\" variable could be added to create a comfort range from any single value. I'll check it out tomorrow morning, hopefully it will be straight forward.\u00a0\n\nbest wishes,\u00a0\n\nMauricio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mauricio Aguilar Cardenas", "created_at": "February 15, 2016 at 1:33pm", "created_by": "MauricioAguilarCardenas135", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463815", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463500"}
