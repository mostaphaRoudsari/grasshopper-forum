{"body": "\nErnesto and Abraham,\n\n\n\nI apologize to both of you for the late reply.\n\n\n\nErnesto, I don't think that there is any need for additionaStrings in your case. \u00a0Just plug in a CSV schedule with fractional values that represent the openness of the screen into the shadeSchedule_ input of the zone shades component (or use one of the setpoint options under the shadeCntrlType_ input). \u00a0Also, your additionalStrings in your GH file do not have any shading control object so, as it is now, the shades are always down. \u00a0If this is your goal, then your file and the corresponding differences in surface temperature are correct.\n\n\n\nAbraham, the geometry in the image that I posted was not generated by the \"Honeybee_Window Shade Generator\" but by Ernesto's script. \u00a0I did not add in any capability to change the perforation of the screen geometry on the Window Shade Generator component for 2 reasons:\n\n1) The user might be having the component represent an interior roller shade, where the perforation is typically so fine that you do not notice any perforation.\n\n2) Adding such perforations would increase the runtime of the component unless I make them particularly coarse.\n\nThis said, I can add in perforations to the geometry if you think the visualization would be helpful. \u00a0I would probably keep the density fairly coarse just to keep the runtime down. \u00a0Or maybe I just add a boolean input for \"show perforation\"?\n\n\n\nLet me know your thoughts,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 6, 2016 at 9:30am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535974", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1542824"}
