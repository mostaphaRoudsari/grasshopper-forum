{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThank you for the help and sorry for the late response. I was trying the parallel run \u00a0in the model. Everything is connecting well, I am able to read the files but my energy plus is not being called/ not running. I wonder what's the obvious mistake I am making. I have attached my folder.\u00a0\n\nOnce again thank you for the help!\n\nVinu\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1389849", "name": "ParallelModel.zip"}], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "October 30, 2015 at 05:36PM", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1388833", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1389848"}
