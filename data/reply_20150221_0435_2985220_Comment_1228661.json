{"body": "\nHi CD2005,\n\n\n\nI was getting the same mistake recently. If you created your zones from individual surfaces then the problem is that one zone is probably not closed. You can quickly verify that if you have an open brep in your list of breps. Try hiding all zones and then visualize each zone surface by surface to find the culprit. At least that was the issue in my case.\n\n<br/>Edit: It could also be that a wall is referenced twice in one zone.\n\n\n\nHope that helps!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 21, 2015 at 04:35AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1228741", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228661"}
