{"body": "\nI have an apartment building that I am trying to model and I need to allow for each bathroom and kitchen extract that is present in each apartment. I know how to add HVAC and general ventilation, but I am unsure how to add specific ventilation items such as these. Can someone please advise which component to use to replicate these systems. I've had a bit of an attempt, but I'm pretty sure that it is wrong.\n\n<br/>Thanks\n\nChelle\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1492125", "name": "Great North Rd Energy Model-24 Mar.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chelle Payne", "created_at": "March 24, 2016 at 08:29PM", "created_by": "ChellePayne", "topic": "Kitchen and Bathroom Extract Fans", "id": "topic_1492126"}
