{"body": "\nHello all<br/>I am working on an architectural project.<br/>Briefly it requires satellite imagery as a base and the volume is generated according to certain parameters.<br/><br/>I am trying to find an optimum form using ladybug radiation analysis and galapagos. The analysis process is becoming extremely slow as i start playing with the geometry.\n\nI have a high config workstation and also have tried galapagos with different simple forms. Not able to figure out if it is the problem of this particular file(Geometry) or because of the satellite imagery or any other reason.<br/><br/>Can anyone help me speeding up this process.Suggestion on any other way of subdividing the geometry is appreciated.<br/><br/>Thankyou.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1778621", "name": "Building volume.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1778622", "name": "Geospatial analysis.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Pramodk", "created_at": "July 05, 2017 at 01:16AM", "created_by": "Pramodk", "topic": "Help me to speed up Ladybug Analysis and Galapagos form finding", "id": "topic_1778623"}
