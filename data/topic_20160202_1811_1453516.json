{"body": "\nHey there,\n\n\n\nI have a small question regarding some of the severe error that are shown on the \"Run Energy Simulation\" component (see the attached pictures).\n\n\n\nI manage to get results from my energy simulation, but I was wondering if the the severe errors will have any major influence on the simulation results, if left unsolved?\u00a0<br/><br/>And if so, any ideas how to solve them?\n\n\n\nThanks for your help\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1453514", "name": "2016.02.03 - Severe Errors.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1453515", "name": "2016.02.03 - The building.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Nickolaj Feldt Jensen", "created_at": "February 02, 2016 at 06:11PM", "created_by": "NickolajFeldtJensen", "topic": "Severe Errors - Influence on the simulation results", "id": "topic_1453516"}
