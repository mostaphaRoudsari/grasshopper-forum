{"body": "\nMustafa\n\nthanks for your reply and useful comments\n\nI managed to enhance the panels in the analysis.\n\nAnother question \u00a0that arose is how could i add artificial light sources within the space to measure illuminance from both artificial and natural light to check for example how much light bulbs and for how long I would need in order to maintain a specific illuminance level .\n\nI tried to use the honeybee_lighting control recipe but was not able to have it working. Also i could not find anything relate while searching so I thought it would be good to start a discussion\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nAttached the two files of the definition with the panels as a .zip file\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183325", "name": "agent_panels_daylight_analysis.zip"}], "created_by_name": "Evangelos Pantazis", "created_at": "December 07, 2014 at 09:19PM", "created_by": "EvangelosPantazis", "topic": "Analysis for Light diffusing panels", "id": "topic_1183326"}
