{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nA few important notes about the air wall surface type:\n\n1) To ensure a correctly-created file, Air walls should only be used to signify interior partitions that are not really there where you want to use both an air wall construction and to mix the air in between zones of an energy simulation. \u00a0Here, you are using them for an exterior surface and this causes both the Radiance simulations and EnergyPlus simulations to fail. \u00a0If you want an exterior surface that lets through light in the radiance simulation and/or air in the thermal simulation, you should use a window instead of an air wall.\n\n2) Your HBZone is not forming a closed volume and, accordingly, it would not work in an energy simulation. \u00a0If your intention is only to use this in a Radiance model, why not just make everything HBSurfaces instead of trying to bring it all into one zone?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 06, 2015 at 08:08PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1257063", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1257605"}
