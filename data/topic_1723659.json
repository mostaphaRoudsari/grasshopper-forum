{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am running the example file on\u00a0[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Urban_Weather_Generator_Workflow&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=8&amp;offset=-974.3998718261719,-2627.0123291015625) by Chris.\n\n\n\nHowever I realized that the temperature difference between the original epw and the morphed one reaches -10 C at night time. As far as I know, the heat island effect is amplified during the night. So the morphed file should never contain temperatures below the original one.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDo you have any idea why this might be the case here?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "ipek", "created_at": "March 29, 2017 at 2:53pm", "created_by": "IpekGursel", "topic": "dragonfly UHI temperature different", "id": "topic_1723659"}
