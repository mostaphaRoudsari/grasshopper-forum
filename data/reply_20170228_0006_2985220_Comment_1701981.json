{"body": "\nHi Michael,\n\nThanks a lot for the thorough comment. Very useful and learning.\n\nI need to apologize for my comment on the calculation time. Completely forgot that indeed Biomet calculates ALL of the domain (as a default), while the LB component do that for only one section.\n\nI'm always expecting the news on ENVImet developments. I understand the development constraints ... but this is not the forum to rise my personal issues with them :-). Maybe i'll write you a personal note.\n\nKeep doing your excellent job with EM, i believe it is inspiring.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 28, 2017 at 12:06AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701948", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701981"}
