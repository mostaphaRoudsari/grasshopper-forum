{"body": "\nHi Tim,\n\nThis is a warning about non-palanar surfaces and happens when you have a non-planar surface which has quad non-planar mesh surfaces even after meshing. If the number of errors are not so many you can disregard it. What is the tolerance value in your model?\n\nYou may want to mesh the geometry beforehand and use msh2RAD component as an alternate workflow.
