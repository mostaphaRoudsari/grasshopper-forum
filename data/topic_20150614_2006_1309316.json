{"body": "\nHi every one,\u00a0\n\nI have finished my first energy simulation using the Honeybee, Finally, I could run the simulation, and I have used the \"color zones by EP results\" successfully, but when it came to the surface results visualizing and making \"indoor radiant temp map\" I stick !!\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/dj7KjSQgc-QDJj2Rx96xeRqnV1IQlqFUsYKFygzxMy87yzStrWDOjXNlWLk8asDU32AM8S6VL8ZCBkr7FO5nQnFxdgAaz*2H/1.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/dj7KjSQgc-QDJj2Rx96xeRqnV1IQlqFUsYKFygzxMy87yzStrWDOjXNlWLk8asDU32AM8S6VL8ZCBkr7FO5nQnFxdgAaz*2H/1.JPG)\n\nthe thing is, I hooked up the \"srfsData\" and \"HB zones\" to the \"color surface by EP results\" and it went good ,so, I used the same parameters to run the \"surface data based on type\" but it showed an error,\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/dj7KjSQgc-SsRwMyVkeyv*NZmO1oODKSTOj9MnT0GaitXNRkMqshU6xdO2Z1dzEPCtRz-J4MzOHpiV*QYrIntYu0i3*bW8Op/2.JPG\" width=\"735\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/dj7KjSQgc-SsRwMyVkeyv*NZmO1oODKSTOj9MnT0GaitXNRkMqshU6xdO2Z1dzEPCtRz-J4MzOHpiV*QYrIntYu0i3*bW8Op/2.JPG)\n\nIn addition, the \"indoor view factor was OK but when I use it to generate the \"indoor radiant temp map\" it also showed an error as attached below.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/dj7KjSQgc-TUhJOcAKhF9UsFN3Rp8um-KRarhWE3ThE9tUVnVl19hiaUDH7hsWD3pbmNj6gFn3blAcYwIwyXxjwZsJFcd2mk/3.JPG\" width=\"738\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/dj7KjSQgc-TUhJOcAKhF9UsFN3Rp8um-KRarhWE3ThE9tUVnVl19hiaUDH7hsWD3pbmNj6gFn3blAcYwIwyXxjwZsJFcd2mk/3.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a very bigger with the data tree structures,so\u00a0I tried disparately to trail and error by grafting and flatten lists, in some instances, errors turned into orange instead of red !\u00a0\n\nI hope someone can guide me through this..\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yasin Mohamed Ibrahim", "created_at": "June 14, 2015 at 08:06PM", "created_by": "YasinMohamedIbrahim", "topic": "Struggled visualize the surface results", "id": "topic_1309316"}
