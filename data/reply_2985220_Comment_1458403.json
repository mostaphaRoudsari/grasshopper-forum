{"body": "\nyou're welcome Abraham,\n\n<br/>some changes are necessary:<br/>1) move the components to HB, as you and Chris suggest me<br/>2) do a small reseach about holidays and find a system to change them based on country. It's almost impossible do that for each country. I have to make a couple of avarage-holidays data.<br/>3) Optimize two components, perhaps combine the their functionality into one component.<br/>4) Maybe, insert a \"shift function\". For example I want my schedules start with Monday, or Tuesday and so on.\n\nBests<br/>Antonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "February 9, 2016 at 12:34am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1458393", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1458403"}
