{"body": "\nHey everyone,\n\n\n\nI wanted to ask if was possible to change the\u00a0visualization of the generated mesh results with both Ladybug and Honeybee (ex. Sunlight hours\u00a0or Daylight Factor) to have a color gradient mesh and not a \"grid\" mesh result.\n\n\n\nThanks and best regards\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sonny Weaver", "created_at": "June 16, 2017 at 2:29am", "created_by": "SonnyWeaver", "topic": "How to Make a result mesh colored gradient with LB /HB?", "id": "topic_1769596"}
