{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\n\n\nSorry for the late reply and this is a good question (it took me a while to figure it out myself). \u00a0The conditional statement that you are constructing between these 4 variables all have AND operators between them (there are no OR operators). \u00a0Expressed mathematically, this statement would look something like this:\n\n\n\nI will only naturally ventilate when:\n\nindoorTemp &gt; minIndoorTempForNatVent_\n\nAND\n\nindoorTemp &lt; maxIndoorTempForNatVent_\n\nAND\n\noutdoorTemp &gt;\u00a0minOutdoorTempForNatVent_\n\nAND\n\noutdoorTemp &lt; maxOutdoorTempForNatVent_\n\n\n\nSo to answer your specific question,\u00a0natural ventilation only be activated when both indoor and outdoor temperatures are within respective NV temperature ranges.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 3, 2016 at 7:57pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1591301", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1593226"}
