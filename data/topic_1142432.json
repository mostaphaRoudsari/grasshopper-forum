{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\n\n\nI have a question on the results I'm getting from honeybee. I'm testing the illuminence in my project at a specific hour with the grid based recipe and the annual recipe, but get different results. I have the same geometry, test points and weather file. I'm pulling the sky for my grid based analysis from the weather file. When I look at the color gradient, I can see similarities, but the lux drops off much quicker in one than the other.\n\n\n\nCan you shed some light on how these two types of analysis compare to each other and why the results would differ? I'm working with our lighting engineers to determine the baseline lighting scenario for the space and I'm not sure which analysis to trust or recommend.\n\n\n\nI attached a simplified version of the rhino model and a GH definition with both workflows.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ep*dLmCPR*zVFuQdYIjFNaSDF2luXgCD4wY0*6ansyOaDAjL2*7sReWcpJrU5KQeOuMpAWuFsYExp2DovNW7ps30tHfx-uLV/gridvsannual.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ep*dLmCPR*zVFuQdYIjFNaSDF2luXgCD4wY0*6ansyOaDAjL2*7sReWcpJrU5KQeOuMpAWuFsYExp2DovNW7ps30tHfx-uLV/gridvsannual.JPG)Thanks for your help,\n\nNate\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1142430", "name": "annual vs grid daylight.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1142431", "name": "annual vs grid daylight.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Nate Holland", "created_at": "October 3, 2014 at 5:51pm", "created_by": "NateHolland", "topic": "Annual vs Grid Daylighiting", "id": "topic_1142432"}
