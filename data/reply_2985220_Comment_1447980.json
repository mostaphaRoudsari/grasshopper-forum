{"body": "\nIn parallel, you run the fly slider to only make a series of idfs, rather than running them (similar to the rad files). You would then use the Re-run idf component to take the idf files and generate batch files, which then you can use a python script component to run the batch files in parallel.\n\nI've included the bit in my workflow if you are curious. Essentially it means that E+ is running several simulations rather than one, and because grasshopper works in real time, it wouldn't be possible to record the data as the simulations are running in parallel to each other.\n\n\n\nI am wondering if you have a solution to this though, I just connected two sliders to the fly component to see how the pollinator recorders might work, and one of the sliders doesn't cycle through the same amount of times as the other, causing a mismatch of the recorded data. Not sure if I am doing them wrong, or if there is a simple fix?\n\n\n\nPS. No i havn't attempted to run yours, I think I can peice everything together within it\n\n\n\n- Elly\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1447981", "name": "Workflow_Forum.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 9:49pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448110", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447980"}
