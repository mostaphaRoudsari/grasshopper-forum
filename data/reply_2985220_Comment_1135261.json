{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks for you answer, it has been very useful. I want to do exactly what you show in your script but applied to a meshed surface instead of a simple surface. This way I can apply a color to the different cells in the mesh and show the distribution of the percentage of time with glare over the whole facade, i.e. what parts of the facade are more affected by glare.\u00a0\n\nI have been trying to apply your script to a mesh without success so far. I attach the new script here.\n\nRegards,\n\nAlejandro\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1135263", "name": "Sample model.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1135264", "name": "Glarescript22sept_APD.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "September 22, 2014 at 6:46am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1134225", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1135261"}
