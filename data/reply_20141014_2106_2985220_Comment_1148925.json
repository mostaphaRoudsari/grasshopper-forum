{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\nA sun-up hour is just an hour in the daytime or, to be more specific, it is an hour when the sun is above the horizon. \u00a0You can use the Ladybug_Sunpath to get all of the sun-up/daytime hours of the year by plugging in an analysis period for the full year into the component (hopefully, this answers your request for having something automated).\n\nYou could use every sun-up/daytime hour of the year with the method that Alejandro was using but the analysis could take a very long time like this so I just suggested that he use a list of average sun-up hours for each month (as you see in the GH file that I posted).\n\nLet me know if things are still unclear,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 14, 2014 at 09:06PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1148087", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1148925"}
