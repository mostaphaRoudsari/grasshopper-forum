{"body": "\nYou have different results because most likely your analysis direction are different in two cases. You can open the two *.pts files to compare the differences. \u00a0\n\n\n\nThe ptsVectors output from genTestPts gives you normal vectors of your input geometry.\u00a0\n\nWhen this output is not connected to the recipe, the analysis direction is taking a default value instead (I imagine it's {0,0,1} pointing upward, not 100% sure).\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhich result is more reliable? Depending the external surface you are calculating. If it's a horizontal surface, the vectors should point upward. If it's a vertical facade, like external walls of building, then the vectors should point outward.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "vhoang", "created_at": "March 30, 2017 at 3:06am", "created_by": "vhoang", "parent_id": "topic_1723881", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1723892"}
