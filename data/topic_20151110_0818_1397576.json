{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nWhen I tried use the \"Grizzly Bear\" gbXML export component of Honeybee, I am getting a warning message indicating that Grizzly Bear Vector Math Dependency and Grizzly Bear Serializer Dependency cannot be found. The error log includes a Drop Box link to download these libraries, but the links are not useful, they are broken. How can I obtain these libraries to start using the Grizzly Bear components.\n\n\n\nHere is the error log that pops up on the upper right corner of the Honeybee component\n\n1. Cannot find Grizzly Bear Vector Math Dependency. You can download the libraries from the link below. Copy the file to C:\\gbXML\n\n2.
