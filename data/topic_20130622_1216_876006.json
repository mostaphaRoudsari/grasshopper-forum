{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostafa, great tool! Really helpful and I love it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am testing Solar radiation on geometry for annual period and also for 4 seasons.\u00a0\n\nNow when we compare two pictures, one with annual analysis and another with winter period, colors are almost same. Just an amount of radiation kWh/m2 is naturally higher or lower.\u00a0\n\nWhat I want to acomplish, is constant legend colors, from 100 - 1200 kWh/m2 for all calculation periods. Maybe with more segments.\u00a0\n\nThen would I get more blue to yellow coloring of winter period and more yellow to red for Summer.\u00a0\n\nThis way is better for understanding amount of radiation in different periods.\u00a0\n\nIs it possible now or is it just my wish.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\u00a0\n\n\n\nIgor\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AwOyT6gC1eH2iYX7HVFTnshTGxuq5yq8JZmQSWLgUF7L6UsVlZYoeMAN7*dLzblb12wAn1fpHLnppJoTHcmcTTq-M92BE3cy/WinterCase.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AwOyT6gC1eH2iYX7HVFTnshTGxuq5yq8JZmQSWLgUF7L6UsVlZYoeMAN7*dLzblb12wAn1fpHLnppJoTHcmcTTq-M92BE3cy/WinterCase.jpg)\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/AwOyT6gC1eEaXocHGrr8W66pVRI7xOVwpShfjeG2hHW7Rx4pldPOjNGoV8TBzmPnESD9BWmPnUFWZ4xQV1M*0I0IENH590Mn/annual.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/AwOyT6gC1eEaXocHGrr8W66pVRI7xOVwpShfjeG2hHW7Rx4pldPOjNGoV8TBzmPnESD9BWmPnUFWZ4xQV1M*0I0IENH590Mn/annual.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A876004", "name": "annual.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A876005", "name": "Winter Case.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Igor Mitri\u0107 Lavovski", "created_at": "June 22, 2013 at 12:16PM", "created_by": "Igor425", "topic": "Solar Radiation Legend Parameters", "id": "topic_876006"}
