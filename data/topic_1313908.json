{"body": "\nI have a HBZone created by assembling individual surfaces via createHBZones component (the zone with colored surfaces shown in the image below).\n\n\n\nIf I create a new building mass adjacent to this zone, how should I do to make sure the surface matching and solving adjacency are done correctly and the information of the first manually assembled zone is kept intact?\n\n\n\nI have a test GH workflow in which the manually created zone and the newly created building mass are connected to intersectMasses and then Mass2Zones and Solve Adjacencies components. However, all the information of the manually created zone is gone...(see image 2 and GH file below)\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-HoKvkav3sxu3i-zY6a8IKVssiyg55pDJo5NDLpMKY0HV6qYpycLkaHrEz9Lv6ImE7CpxTgEowAYQjF6gJP96LJv7T8HBdF0/01.PNG\" width=\"622\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-HoKvkav3sxu3i-zY6a8IKVssiyg55pDJo5NDLpMKY0HV6qYpycLkaHrEz9Lv6ImE7CpxTgEowAYQjF6gJP96LJv7T8HBdF0/01.PNG)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-HoKvkav3sxvWGG*yS7soIrNKWO6fu1OVHJX5m96GgJgUn0ryJsLxEN8hQOUGGPGlpCUQfeQ2wl*INdc7Qq0ud883iZx83OS/02.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-HoKvkav3sxvWGG*yS7soIrNKWO6fu1OVHJX5m96GgJgUn0ryJsLxEN8hQOUGGPGlpCUQfeQ2wl*INdc7Qq0ud883iZx83OS/02.PNG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1313907", "name": "ZJ_Tut_13_HBSurf_v002.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "June 23, 2015 at 12:46am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "how to intersect a building mass with an existing HBZone?", "id": "topic_1313908"}
