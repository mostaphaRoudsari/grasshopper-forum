{"body": "\nAnother questions,\u00a0\n\nThis is an example from the website about Shade Benefit. What I understand is that the \"Shade Creator\" give us the area of the Roof that depend on our percentage to keep. And what I confused is how to take that information to the next step, is that the best shape for these roofs? what could i do with that \"benefit area\" and not benefit area. Thank alot\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UjLFZWxAkgpqVbUSdhW1ZDv3e3MeB4L6McSeRVItgYviGubEjQNTX7-j5K4XqhRUJFp68k2HNLalsqvuB3f2NSN8BiT4BDSx/shade_Perspective.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UjLFZWxAkgpqVbUSdhW1ZDv3e3MeB4L6McSeRVItgYviGubEjQNTX7-j5K4XqhRUJFp68k2HNLalsqvuB3f2NSN8BiT4BDSx/shade_Perspective.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bao Nguyen", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 11:30PM", "created_by": "BaoNguyen", "parent_id": "topic_1448739", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448845"}
