{"body": "\nHi Chris and Mostapha thank you for your answers,\n\n\n\nI went through the examples but I didn't find what I was looking for. I saw the Radiation_in_an_Urban_Canyon example but it uses the ladybug radiation analysis, and I need to take into account the reflections for my project.\n\n\n\nChris is the total MRT from th microclimate maps uses the \"**effective radiant field**\" Model ?\n\n\n\nLet me tell you more about my project, it's about the comfort in the semi-opened spaces, I first introduce a new PMV OutSET into EnergyPlus which calculate the comfort from the steady state and not the permanent state, because the people will only be here for a few minutes and the body will not body in his permanent state.\n\n\n\nNow I have to modify the calculation of the mean radiant temperature, I first did a study where I took several values of the solar heat gains from 9 points. It appeared that the thermal comfort changed a lot between the different points.\n\n\n\nDue to this conclusion I am looking for a way to obtain a map of the solar heat gain through the floor of the railway station to calculate a new mean radiant temperature (using the energy radiant field model) to finally obtain a comfort map of the building.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI hope you understand the problematic of the project I have,\n\n\n\nThank you for your help,\n\nMehdi.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mehdi HAMDANI", "created_at": "March 16, 2017 at 03:54AM", "created_by": "MehdiHAMDANI", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1713464", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1713730"}
