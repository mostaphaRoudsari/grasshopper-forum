{"body": "\nHi everyone,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have existing radiance files, radiance material files, and points files and would like to run them using radiance through honeybee. However if I use the following component shown in the image, I need to have honeybee objects. How would I convert my radiance model to being a Honeybee object? OR is this the wrong component to be using?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\u00a0\n\nSandi\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cs*GHo7eRuP-4rm6hy46Cg3nIRxtgSR17RIr9OkvaPGdghu098MQ17fuGGNwvO5NDFOlrvcMqcSqqDusWAL0Y1PjEjs7u7Z7/HB.PNG\" width=\"341\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cs*GHo7eRuP-4rm6hy46Cg3nIRxtgSR17RIr9OkvaPGdghu098MQ17fuGGNwvO5NDFOlrvcMqcSqqDusWAL0Y1PjEjs7u7Z7/HB.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sandi Sirikhanchai", "created_at": "June 26, 2017 at 7:06pm", "created_by": "SandiSirikhanchai", "topic": "Running an existing radiance model with points files", "id": "topic_1774861"}
