{"body": "\nHi Pablo\n\n\n\nI can get this to run fine. I did notice you had a couple of legacy components still in your script. For example your 'Write EP result' is a 2014 component. This is the root of your problem.\n\n\n\nPerhaps pull the latest from Github and make sure the components are updating. If not then I would manually update the ones you need as the script is not that big so should not take too long.\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "August 02, 2016 at 05:31AM", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "parent_id": "topic_1575019", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1575022"}
