{"body": "\nHi,\n\nJust being curious, i tried to implement Julia's method (under Chris's suggestion), but i get, unfortunately an error with the windRose component.\n\nI managed to select/extract the desired hours data. Plugged them into the windSpeed/Direction and then i get the following error:\n\nRuntime error (IndexOutOfRangeException): index out of range: 2899<br/>Traceback:<br/>\u00a0 line 198, in unpackPatternList, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/>\u00a0 line 568, in main, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/>\u00a0 line 1131, in script\n\nFrom what i understand i can't input the data as a selected list. I also understand that the list must be annual.\n\nIn short, Devang method is fine, as long as you want the analysis for \"dark\" hours. But if i want a selected range of hours it fits less.\n\nI can't see how to implement Julia's method.\n\nI probably missed something here ...\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1662376", "name": "04_WindAnalysis - NightHours.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 25, 2016 at 6:41am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1660965", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1662374"}
