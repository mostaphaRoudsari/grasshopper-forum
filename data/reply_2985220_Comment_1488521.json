{"body": "\nQinheng,\n\nThe thermal map is a really detailed, time-consuming analysis that you usually don't want to dive into until you have already understood/debugged your energy model on a coarse zone-by-zone level. \u00a0I would really recommend watching the full youtube tutorial series on the EnergyPlus workflow before jumping to the thermal maps:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8Y...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_)\n\nThe series will also show you how to set up your geometry as multi-zone with air walls, which you will have to do in order to get the \"non-convex\" error to go away.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 19, 2016 at 2:59pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1488419", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1488521"}
