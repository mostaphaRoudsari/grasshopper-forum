{"body": "Carmelo,\nIn most cases, a CHKBKS error is not severe but it seems you have found a case where this error actually is severe. A 272.45 degree Celcius surface surface temperature is definitely not realistic and it's likely that this is caused by the solar distribution error. I suggest changing the solar distribution type to be FullExteriorWithReflections using the Energy Sim Par component as I state in the other discussions that you reference.\nAnd, while you don't have an L-shaped zone, it is a concave zone and this is what causes the error (an L-shaped zone is just one type of concave zone). My suggestion above will get your simulation running correctly but this error is a limitation of E+ and not Honeybee. So it's not something g that we can fix on our end and we have to hope that the E+ developer team eventually addresses this better.\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 11, 2017 at 02:20AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1811597", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1811787"}
