{"body": "\nHey!\n\nI was running an energy simulation with HB and I realized that if I vary the ventilation rate (per person or per floor area) the heating energy needs stayed the same, which does not make sense.\u00a0\n\nMy first guess was that it had to do with the ventilation schedule, but I did not find a ventilation schedule in Honeybee. Does anyone know what can be wrong. I attach the script.\u00a0\n\nAlso I wanted to know if it was possible to include the effect of a heat recovery system in the calculation.\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nAle\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1165308", "name": "141107 WTC HB.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1165309", "name": "141107 WTC HB.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "November 10, 2014 at 7:11am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Ventilation rate does not affect the heating energy needs?", "id": "topic_1165610"}
