{"body": "\nHi everyone,<br/><br/>First of all, a question for you: is it possible to assign a blind to an horizontal window in Energy+? I never tried but until today I didn't think it would have been a problem to do it.<br/><br/>I'm actually struggling with the\u00a0\"Honeybee_EnergyPlus Window Shade Generator\" component in order to assign some blinds objects to a couple of horizontal windows situated on a roof surface.\n\nIf I set to true in the \"horOrVertical_\" input I get this error message:<br/>\"1. Solution exception:step must be less than 0\".<br/>If I set it to false I get this error:<br/>\"1. Solution exception:Local variable 'normalVectorPerp' referenced before assignment.\"\n\nIf I slightly rotate the surface so that it's not horizontal anymore the blinds appears in the brep preview but they don't respect my input values for depth, distance between the glass and the shades and so on..<br/><br/>At this point I'm not sure if it's a problem in the HoneyBee environment or if it's not possible to do something like this in Energy+. I look forward to hear your suggestions.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance,\n\nClaudio<br/><br/><br/>\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Marini", "created_at": "December 7, 2015 at 10:58am", "created_by": "ClaudioMarini", "topic": "Assigning blinds to a horizontal window", "id": "topic_1416603"}
