{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\ni\u00b4ve got a problem with daylight simulation.\n\nSome windows are counted as radiance material and some windows are not.\n\nI\u00b4ve checked (with itersect tool in rhino)\u00a0if they all are coplanar with the wall and\u00a0yes they are, as i build them copying InPlace the wall and scale it.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/irXjnN9QuLJj8s8HuOsJr-*RDDdbL4PsgFY7u5643-JlBYaKcPnVUcHYXAblEsZlkaNigbyxBh7yOn2vKB0PAMah-zYSAD46/2.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/irXjnN9QuLJj8s8HuOsJr-*RDDdbL4PsgFY7u5643-JlBYaKcPnVUcHYXAblEsZlkaNigbyxBh7yOn2vKB0PAMah-zYSAD46/2.JPG)\n\nbut, as you can see, for some windows i get no result, and, according to the LabelZoneSurfaces component, those windows are not counted as\u00a0Radiance Material.\n\nWhat should i do? What is the problem?\n\nLet me know if you need the rhino and gh files.\n\n\u00a0\n\nN.B. (I can\u00b4t find the way to reply to my discussion so i\u00b4m writing a new one, hope it is\u00a0no a problem)\u00a0\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "December 18, 2015 at 2:03am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Honeybee: Daylight - Radiance Material problem", "id": "topic_1423272"}
