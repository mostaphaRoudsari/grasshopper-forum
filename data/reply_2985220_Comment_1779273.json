{"body": "\nPetr,\n\n\n\nEPW files at their core are really just specialized forms of CSV files. \u00a0So your best bet might be to just open an existing EPW in Excel and replace the data in the columns with the data that you have in your XML. \u00a0I don't know how your XML is structured or even if the weather data is hourly so it's hard to know whether this method would work. If you upload the XML, we might be able to help you more.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, if you download your historical data from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC):\n\n[https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/maps/ncei/cdo/hourly](https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/maps/ncei/cdo/hourly)\n\n... I've written a small component to format the downloaded data into an EPW (assuming that you have an existing nearby EPW to start with).\n\n\n\nThe component is under the Dragonfly beta and you can download it here:\n\n[https://github.com/chriswmackey/Dragonfly/raw/master/userObjects/Dr...](https://github.com/chriswmackey/Dragonfly/raw/master/userObjects/Dragonfly_AMY%20from%20NCDC%20Data.ghuser)\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 6, 2017 at 4:48am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1778931", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1779273"}
