{"body": "\nHas anyone ever used this E+ object?\n\n(found at [http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/pa...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/page-014.html#group-room-air-models))\n\n\n\nIt seems to be stated in the guide that this option is kind of a post-processing of other results the user might have (and one possible source stated is CFD). But the description provided isn't really illuminating. It seems that the CFD results could possibly be inputed in the form of a temperature stratification using a lookup table (like it is done in the nonDimensionalHeight object). But I really can't be sure. I wonder if anyone has used it before.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I just realized I have been asking a lot of E+ focused questions and might be out of context of the forum. I apologize for that, I will tone it down. I do believe though that this post might be strongly connected with this forum due to the development of Butterfly.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 04, 2016 at 08:49PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "RoomAir:TemperaturePattern:UserDefined - Using CFD results in E+", "id": "topic_1430815"}
