{"body": "Hi Elly,\n\nI just added a transmittance input on Ladybug_Radiation analysis yesterday and this will allow you to account for the transparent canopy in this simple radiation simulation. You can also always use the Honeybee radiation analysis for more detailed transmittance studies with Radiance.\n\nFianlly, you can model a transparent material in the microclimate maps using the following example file as a guide:\nhttp://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&for...\nNote that you want to set the transmittance on both the E+ simulation and the view factor component.\n\nAs a small note, a glass canopy would still be a different from no canopy at all as clear uncoated glass usually has a transmittance of ~85\u2105.\n\nHope this helps,\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 01, 2017 at 06:46AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1681516", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1682619"}
