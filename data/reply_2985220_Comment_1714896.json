{"body": "\nThe signal is variable, it based on what you are trying to do. I am not an expert on this subject but the purpose of dynamic shading is blocking excessive direct sunlight. Therefore, you should look some illuminance at a certain hour during the year (winter and summer solstice, 9,12,15 hour) when the spaces receives direct sunlight based on the azimuth angle of the facade. There is some more advanced approach to control the shades is looking at the profile angle and the illuminance value at the same time which I believe could be done through the glarecontrol_recipe.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Willy Tsui", "created_at": "March 17, 2017 at 6:16pm", "created_by": "WillyTsui", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714876", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714896"}
