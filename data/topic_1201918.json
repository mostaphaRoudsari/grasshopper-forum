{"body": "\nI have created a series of windroses from ladybug, and baked them into rhino. \u00a0 I am trying to figure out the process for getting them into illustrator, while maintaining their colors. (surface/fill colors, outline colors work fine).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best I could do was to create outlines of the faces and then color them based on the vertex color and bake them, (used human plugin to bake with colors). \u00a0Then I exported from rhino as DXF, (using 2004 settings), and made sure to uncheck \"explode polylines\".\n\n\n\nThis got the line work into illustrator with colors, but still no fill. \u00a0I ended up individually selecting each outline path and shift+X swaps the stroke and fill color. \u00a0It only seemed to work with one path selected..\n\nIs there any preferred workflow for getting analysis mesh output from rhino to Illustrator?\n\nAny suggestions would be welcome.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Hanley", "created_at": "January 9, 2015 at 3:12pm", "created_by": "ChrisHanley", "topic": "Analysis Mesh, export to illustrator?", "id": "topic_1201918"}
