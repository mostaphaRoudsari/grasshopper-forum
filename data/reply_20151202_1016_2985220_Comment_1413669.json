{"body": "\nHi Tasos,\n\n\n\nThere is a Honeybee_Refine Daylight Simulation component but it doesn't exactly do what you're looking for. Re-running daylight analysis is not as straight forward as idf file since it can be very different based on analysis type. Not to say that it is still possible. If I get a chance to re-write the libraries we can add a pkg file where we can track all the input files for the study and re-create the analysis as needed.\n\n\n\nReRun idf is now updated and looks like a standard Honeybee component ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/d6daf39cea34e9d...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/d6daf39cea34e9d66577db19440802ae1713f0f7)).\n\n\n\nBack to the libraries Ladybug and Honeybee should not overwrite or re-create the files if you already have them in the folder. Let me know if this is not the case and we will address it.\n\n\n\nI'm waiting for OpenStudio team for your last wish. They are already creating a web-service that can take care of what you mentioned above. Once they have it done you can use it next to the OpenStudio component.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 02, 2015 at 10:16AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1406947", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1413669"}
