{"body": "\nClaudia,\n\nThe results that you have posted here make sense to me. \u00a0The ventilation seems to be typically at 3 ACH and it is only increasing this ACH in order to recirculate air to meet the peak cooling loads in summer. \u00a0In these peak cooling conditions, it likely needs to force more air past the cooling coils in order to remove the heat from the space (hence, why it jumps up to 5 ACH). \u00a0Of course, this is all assuming that you are using the OpenStudio component and you are modeling a HVAC system with recirculation (like VAV).\n\nIf you are not modeling something like this, please upload the file so that I can see what is being modeled.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 16, 2016 at 10:06am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619440", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619573"}
