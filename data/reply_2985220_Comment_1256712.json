{"body": "\nDear Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you for replying. The problem mainly happens while it tries to solve adjacency for many zones. I haven't been able to sort out the adjacency so I am not sure if this would also be carried over to later operations. I think I have been pushing the limit of HB a bit by having 200+ thermal zones across 7 floors but anyway, I still think HB has got great potential especially because Rhino is the primary mean of 3D communication between Architects and sustainability consultants here in Japan.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nDaniel\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Daniel Mak", "created_at": "April 4, 2015 at 7:23pm", "created_by": "DanielMak", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256611", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256712"}
