{"body": "\nHello, is it possible to apply a conditional statement to the Radiation Analysis Component?\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor example, I'd like to run an annual analysis on a 3D Geometry, but only visualize the kWh/m2 hitting the surface for the extremely hot time of the year. I can setup a conditional statement with the Solar Path Component, but I'd then like to apply that time-frame to the Radiation Analysis Component.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reid Weber", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 11:57AM", "created_by": "ReidWeber", "topic": "Applying Conditional Statements to Radiation Analysis", "id": "topic_1749410"}
