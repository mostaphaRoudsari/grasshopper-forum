{"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\n\n\nThe tool seems very useful and has great potential for scalability! I am trying to use it on a small box model as you have demonstrated in your post but seem to persistently run into an error. From my understanding EnergyPlus is not recognizing my the inverter and generator (called 'inverter1' and 'generator1') created and returns that:\u00a0\n\n\n\n1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> ** Severe ** GetPowerManagerInput: ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:Simple=\"INVERTER1\", invalid entry.\n\n2. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> ** Severe ** GetPowerManagerInput: ElectricLoadCenter:Generators=\"SYSTEM1\", invalid entry.\n\n\n\nI have attached the file I used. Any ideas what might be causing this? Thank you!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1538780", "name": "unnamed.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antoine Dao", "created_at": "May 30, 2016 at 05:00AM", "created_by": "AntoineDao", "parent_id": "topic_1350615", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1538778"}
