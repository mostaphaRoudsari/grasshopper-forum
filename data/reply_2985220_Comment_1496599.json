{"body": "\nJustin,\n\nGlad that you were able to update the file.\n\nKeep in mind that the shade benefit calculation usually takes a good 2-5 minutes to complete. \u00a0It is projecting over 4000 sun rays from each of the 100+ test points on each of the windows so it's fairly computationally intensive.\n\nJust give it some time and you should get the result that you see on the Hydra example. I might also recommend running it for just one zone if you need faster feedback.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 30, 2016 at 7:36am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1496412", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1496599"}
