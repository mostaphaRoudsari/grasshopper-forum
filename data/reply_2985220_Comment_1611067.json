{"body": "\nSimulating Venetian blinds with Daysim is a little tricky. You'd probably want to first check for convergence before you settle on the ab=2 parameter. The chances of rays traced from your illuminance points escaping a room with Venetian blinds and hitting the sky patches with ab=2 are pretty slim.\n\nIlluminance sensors for glare control can be added to a daylighting simulation before as you mentioned. It is just a lot of hassle to then segregate that result from that single point and fashion a control algorithm out of it. Besides it won't be very efficient either. Let's say that you have five settings for your blinds corresponding to different illuminance thresholds for your sensor. Those five settings will be five separate daylight coefficient calculations and hence five individual simulations. Including an extra point by the way of an illuminance sensor, albeit an external one, in the preliminary calculation implies that you repeat the same calculation for the point as many times when just one will suffice.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "October 4, 2016 at 9:55pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1610061", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1611067"}
