{"body": "\nHi Orn, Kartik, et al.\n\nFirst of all I'm really so sorry for the delay. As you can read up there release of Butterfly is up to the release of EFRI-PULSE project! I am as frustrated as everybody else not seeing it out yet. I even set-up a call between some of the interested users and EFRI-PULSE project team members, few months ago, hoping that will make the process to go faster but it didn't seem to make a huge difference.\n\nUnfortunately I have no control on the release date and based on the last call that we had last week it won't be released soon! :|\n\nMy apologies,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 1, 2014 at 9:52pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1159221", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1160241"}
