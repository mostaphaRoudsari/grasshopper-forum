{"body": "\nSo many thanks Mostapha for the speedy reply.\n\n\n\nI've changed it so that the Larger component in the Cull area now takes the input values from the Flatten component you inserted. (I did this as all three rooms were displaying the same area of working plane even after I varied the window configuration to check). \u00a0\n\n\n\nI've also taken the workplane area directly from the initial meshes output from the generate test points component, as this was previously reporting the combined area of all three rooms.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo, hopefully the final question is that in the attached example, the Workplane Area Above Threshold panel at the end of the culling process appears to be reporting the combined area of the three rooms above the threshold value. I'm unclear how to make this report the individual value for each room - which is what I really want.\u00a0\n\n\n\nbtw - I hadn't updated the LB &amp; HB versions, as a previous version of the same file developed an error message in the RunDaylightSimulation componen when I did (1. Solution exception:exportTypeFile() takes exactly 4 arguments (3 given)) and I couldn't figure out what was wrong.\u00a0\n\n\n\nmany thanks\u00a0\n\n\n\nNick\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1517832", "name": "3roommodel_v2.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1517833", "name": "ViewofSky_160427_msr_v2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Nick Devlin", "created_at": "April 27, 2016 at 8:45am", "created_by": "NickDevlin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1517912", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1517830"}
