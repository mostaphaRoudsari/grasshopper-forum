{"body": "\nHi Anton and Mostapha,<br/><br/>1) Thanks for providing me with the link directly Anton, especially the second one. Its all there. And it would be interesting to conduct a comparative study between the two you are right, Mostapna. Especially preciseness in mutual shading calc is interesting for me.<br/><br/>2) No need to integrate those inputs for my sake right now. I have encountered some issues and am thinking about switching to the ladybug pv-components. My issue is that I cant seem to fill a surface with a pv-module (close to) completely. The PV-module component warns about me using more than 85% and it outputs that im using 97,5%, however the E+ simulation outputs errors that the solar fraction on the surface is 1,975 and it wants to stay in the bound of 0-1.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "November 18, 2015 at 1:45am", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1402490", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1402694"}
