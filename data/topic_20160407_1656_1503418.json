{"body": "\nI've set up an integrated daylighting and building energy model for a number of shading geometries. I was originally running all the calculations through OpenStudio but I was getting unrealistically low transmitted beam energy values. I went to double check these results by plugging in the same HBZones into EnergyPlus and got much more realistic results.\u00a0\n\nI've spend a lot of time adjusting inputs to see if something was throwing off OpenStudio. I use a lot of custom schedules but none should affect transmitted solar energy. I've even tried with no shading devices and still get drastically different results.\u00a0\n\nI have attached my file if that is helpful for debugging. Am I doing something wrong to throw off the results?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1503417", "name": "EnergyVsShadingStudy_forDebugging.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Justin Shultz", "created_at": "April 07, 2016 at 04:56PM", "created_by": "JustinShultz", "topic": "EnergyPlus and OpenStudio Components Giving Different Transmitted Solar Energy", "id": "topic_1503418"}
