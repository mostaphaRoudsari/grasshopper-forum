{"body": "\nHello guys,\n\nExploring the the boundaries of modeling huge buildings with HB, I\u00b4m trying to setup a case-study of a sky-rise building that includes plenums. I\u00b4m uncertain about how to weave the settings of such a model. I started defining the attributes for each zone by spreading each of them in a branch, yet at one point the attributes started being assigned to the geometry of a single zone (Pics). I added some questions, and some of the limitations I found when generating the model in the file I\u00b4m attaching. Any feedback would be appreciated!\n\nAlejandro\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5SYuKLMNKFwCKYdZSwA5iU*xwCt37rwO6XWHqgeABdYkS90LsjyoHtgIc3rbSGOgxNNF3FZTcV4lhrj*y4pGGRoLKUP7YmAS/Model1.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5SYuKLMNKFwCKYdZSwA5iU*xwCt37rwO6XWHqgeABdYkS90LsjyoHtgIc3rbSGOgxNNF3FZTcV4lhrj*y4pGGRoLKUP7YmAS/Model1.png)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5SYuKLMNKFzjMkG6kxFKwORxwFLbyngyU3CoovKYGB69yXpLgNy2ilJeYB*Xrc5ZnmObBjJXzSwfOU9U2K30nA5mFp8b3CxU/Model2.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5SYuKLMNKFzjMkG6kxFKwORxwFLbyngyU3CoovKYGB69yXpLgNy2ilJeYB*Xrc5ZnmObBjJXzSwfOU9U2K30nA5mFp8b3CxU/Model2.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Gamas", "created_at": "February 3, 2015 at 2:13am", "created_by": "AlejandroGamas", "topic": "Setting up a skyrise with plenums for E+", "id": "topic_1215967"}
