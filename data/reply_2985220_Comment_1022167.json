{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nBreps are not converting into HBobj for some odd reason ( as seen in the printscreen). I have checked my GHpython component several times, even reverted to GHpython 0.5.101 from the latest GHpython. I have tested the components and they were successful. I am not sure if I am missing something or not? I even tried the file you uploaded here on this discussion page (also attached). Also, I have the latest grasshopper installed.\n\nThanks.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1022169", "name": "Screenshot 2014-03-08 14.52.12.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1022170", "name": "Screenshot 2014-03-08 14.56.55.png"}], "created_by_name": "Yassin Ashour", "created_at": "March 8, 2014 at 2:57pm", "created_by": "YassinAshour450", "parent_id": "topic_1013193", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1022167"}
