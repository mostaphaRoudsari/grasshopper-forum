{"body": "\nAymeric,\n\nThank you for finding these bugs and I'll try to fix them now. \u00a0The OpenStudio component is supposed to handle all that the old IDF component used to do so I would much rather have you just get that working. \u00a0I should also say that, if you construct schedules with the Annual Schedule component, you should never have any issues with them being written into the .osm or .idf.\n\nIf I fall asleep before I get the bugs fied, I'll get them tomorrow.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 12, 2017 at 09:18PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1731951", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1732435"}
