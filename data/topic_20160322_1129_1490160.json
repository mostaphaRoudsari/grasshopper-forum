{"body": "\nHi Guys,\n\n\n\nI've run an annual result and tried to use the Read Annual Results component, but it gives an index error. I've worked a little with Sarith and he suggested that I post to the forum. He believes the issue is that I have multiple test surfaces. I've run the simulation with between 8 cores, so I got 8 different result files. My test points has 4 branches for the 4 test surfaces. The index error occurs at the line:\n\n\n\n\"for branchNum in range (_testPoints.BranchCount):\"\n\n\n\nSarith thinks that it might not know how to recombine the results and assign them to the test points. Also, I did a grid based analysis before and was able to get the results using the Read Rad component and was able to use the color mesh component to visualize results. Not sure if that's relevant, but I know that at least one Read Result component has succeeded in assigning my results to the correct test points.\n\n\n\nThanks guys.\n\n\n\np.s.\n\nI've linked my gh and my results folder\n\n\n\n[GH](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5rB4Oaa0lyfTUE4Q04xdzlOejA/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[Folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5rB4Oaa0lyfUEZ0T0g4dDFIRHM&amp;usp=sharing)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Keyes", "created_at": "March 22, 2016 at 11:29AM", "created_by": "JohnKeyes", "topic": "Read Annual result error", "id": "topic_1490160"}
