{"body": "\nHi All!\n\n\n\nFirstly, YAY I'm glad this component has arrived! Removes the annoying spagehti mess of the native components.\n\n\n\nHowever, I am curious as to why it has been coded to extrude the windows INSIDE the model. Typically these are extruded outside. The reason why I ask is because in daylighting analysis, these extrusions cause some shading under them which is not accurate.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/G6D6VGDF3GtQEk*KpYVi4QdgZOG6BnEhonD-S53TDoUOkFNgyYIH-10jeHAB*XBjtNVxIq2u4VQ-l7Ga0YYC6Dr5YIywHRVm/Extrusionsontheinside.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/G6D6VGDF3GtQEk*KpYVi4QdgZOG6BnEhonD-S53TDoUOkFNgyYIH-10jeHAB*XBjtNVxIq2u4VQ-l7Ga0YYC6Dr5YIywHRVm/Extrusionsontheinside.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 28, 2016 at 03:30PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Window Extrusion Component making the extrusions on the inside", "id": "topic_1449360"}
