{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nIf the goal of the polygon(s) is only the graphics (for showing) i believe the 2 polygons are fine (min and max over the analysis period).\n\nThe question is regarding the calculation of comfort. How it is done and/or how it should be done. The right way is point by point with the respective wind speed. What i understood is that this option can crash GH (isn't it? Or it happens just because it shows 8760 polygons?). If so the right way is not an option.\n\nI'm thinking: There are 4 polygons overall, right (0, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2 m/s). So what if, according to the wind speed you take one of those polygons for the calculation, and for the graphic output the 2, min and max?\n\n\n\nAs for the options you mention, 1 is the one that \"makes sense\".\n\nOp. 2 (average year), really DON'T.\n\nOp.3 can be but didn't understand how it works for the calculation.\n\n\n\nMakes sense?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 23, 2016 at 2:13pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490772", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490997"}
