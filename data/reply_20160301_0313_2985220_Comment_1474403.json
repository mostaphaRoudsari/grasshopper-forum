{"body": "\nHi Mostapha. Yes, I was trying to dump just one set of zones from a specific floor as it was the separateZonesByFloor component that was taking a long time to recomputed. But all adjacencies between floors are set as are adiabatic.[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"187\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Rpn4otvspvEqsZnQV*K9BpCRvBQbLHFVHx9hRHC*9zPjlDim5bEkOkxzPckQY*8PGIKOVCn8I*IrguuHdkLsnnDYw0XJS4pB/Capture4.JPG?width=721\" style=\"width: 262px; height: 76px;\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Rpn4otvspvEqsZnQV*K9BpCRvBQbLHFVHx9hRHC*9zPjlDim5bEkOkxzPckQY*8PGIKOVCn8I*IrguuHdkLsnnDYw0XJS4pB/Capture4.JPG)I've just tried dumping all zones after the separation, but they come back 'flattened', so I have to separate after loading. I've used a simple split tree directly this time and selected the zones I wanted and that is much faster, but it would be interesting to be able to dump just selected zones and take adjacencies with it (possibly only adiabatic adjacencies)?\n\n\n\nMany thanks for the help!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Gustavo B", "created_at": "March 01, 2016 at 03:13AM", "created_by": "GustavoB", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1474156", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1474403"}
