{"body": "\nHello forum,\n\nWhen I work with Skydome component I can't but notice the irregularities in the patches, especially when using Reinhart model. For example (image), in the middle of sunny July there are suddenly some blue patches (low solar radiation). I understand it as the day being cloudy or rainy (for several days even), since single patch displays a a number of days, there are sometimes, occasionally, cloudy days that just happen to appear on one patch, thus such irregularity.\n\n\n\nSince data is collected throughout the decades on a physical equipment, there is no way sky dome can show sunny days during the whole year (unless it is in Sahara or somewhere)\n\n\n\nThese are, of course, just guesses, I would like to hear some knowledgeable opinion on topic to be super sure.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ls0m4bJ0x4flXy62S1hcdkzmpWPGf79XcaaOc-*TehjLtjbo*ceDbjPCXxrc9iKIieGl6mj-37UvA-kBdJRaiUpye7YwDrKi/SkyDome.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ls0m4bJ0x4flXy62S1hcdkzmpWPGf79XcaaOc-*TehjLtjbo*ceDbjPCXxrc9iKIieGl6mj-37UvA-kBdJRaiUpye7YwDrKi/SkyDome.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 7:28am", "created_by": "Timur582", "topic": "About SkyDome Visualization", "id": "topic_1405345"}
