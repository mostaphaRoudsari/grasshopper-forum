{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\u00a0\n\nThank you! The batch files are created after the energy plus simulation is done (same as Elzine mentioned about). I need to run parallel idf's. Instead of the batch files, can we do it for multiple idf's? And also when I tried running the\u00a0parallel batch \u00a0files the energy plus was getting aborted, but it was running the simulation for single files.[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/oG6SegPhuVkcJEWp34v89xjn5ZlyN0x3IZ7xvbIzg5Kt684NbQ5*TR*50Vw9qoqffbN1YuZuFDcJImG*t7X-y6vwMdLjVlQM/BatchErroe.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/oG6SegPhuVkcJEWp34v89xjn5ZlyN0x3IZ7xvbIzg5Kt684NbQ5*TR*50Vw9qoqffbN1YuZuFDcJImG*t7X-y6vwMdLjVlQM/BatchErroe.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "October 19, 2015 at 12:01pm", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1381439", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1381777"}
