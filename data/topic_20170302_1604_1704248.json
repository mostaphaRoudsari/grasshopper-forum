{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI am doing a shading study for a trellis. (Please see attached)\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am trying to understand the legend for the shading study. I know that this is telling me the amount of daylight hours on the testing surface. What I don't understand is why the hours are not adding up to the total number of hours for that month.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI know June has 744 Hours but the total number of hours for June in the analysis adds up 1809.5. If anyone can explain this to me I would greatly appreciate it. \u00a0I have also added the study for the month of December and again the total number of hours adds up to 1221 hours.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated. I also included the script being used.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1704245", "name": "June.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1704246", "name": "December.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1704247", "name": "17_0301 Shadow_Range_analysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "March 02, 2017 at 04:04PM", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "topic": "Shading Analysis", "id": "topic_1704248"}
