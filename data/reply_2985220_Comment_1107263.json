{"body": "\nI think you are on the right track. Be sure to size each \"cactus\" based on the\u00a0incident angle measurements generated from each point. I would cull all negative data to ensure you aren't using vectors that are fully blocked by the facade. You can do this using the cull pattern component and test each cos to see if it is negative. Use the resultant Boolean argument as the cull pattern mask. If your data tree structure is correct, you should be able to scale the cactus on each point based on the values calculated at each point. All surfaces, even the horizontal ones, should weight the incoming values based on the incident angle.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "July 27, 2014 at 11:58am", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1106568", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1107263"}
