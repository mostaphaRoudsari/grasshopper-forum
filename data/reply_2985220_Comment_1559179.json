{"body": "\nHi Chris,<br/><br/>Grasshopper forum supports only 5mb attachments. Upload the zipped folder to some file sharing website.\n\nWhat is your Windows version and Rhino 5 x64\u00a0version?\n\n<br/>I think it depends on windows version, (maybe even antivirus software, although I may be wrong on antivirus) whether the downloaded .zip file would be blocked or not.<br/>One thing is certain: if a user unblocks a .zip file file and then extracts its content, none of the extracted files will never be blocked.<br/>In my opinion the number of topics that we regularly receive on genDayMtx.exe would be much less if users would have to install the genDayMtx.exe manually (where installation would include a step with unblocking).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 2, 2016 at 12:08pm", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559100", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559179"}
