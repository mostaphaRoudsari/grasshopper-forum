{"body": "\nHey All,\n\n\n\nThank you so much for helping with responses so actively.\n\n\n\nCurrently I was trying to run a simple energy simulation for my building and it is giving me the following errors:\n\n\n\n1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error:\u00a0\n\n** Severe ** GetSurfaceData: Some Outward Facing angles of subsurfaces differ significantly from base surface.\n\n2. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> ** Severe ** Problem in interior solar distribution calculation (CHKBKS)\n\n3. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> ** Severe ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 4 surfaces which are casting surfaces and are non-convex.\n\n\n\nI have never seen these errors in the past few months of performing these simulations for the same building and I would be grateful for any help in solving these.\n\n\n\nI actually am on a time crunch as my review for this project is in 2 days.\n\n\n\nI really appreciate all the help.\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\nAmrita Ghosh\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1279317", "name": "e+error.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1279318", "name": "New + Existing Structure_divided zones_with windows_energy+solar gain_3rdMay_with shell.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Amrita Ghosh", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 10:06pm", "created_by": "AmritaGhosh", "topic": "energy plus simulation error", "id": "topic_1279319"}
