{"body": "\nHi. This has been a very interesting read.\n\nI think that you need to start using systems that support concurrent processing in the cloud for these batch processes if the generating radiance .ill files seems to be the issue here. Do the batch files need to be ran procedurely here or can they be ran concurrently?\n\nIf they can be ran concurrently, you would be able to define their dependencies and package them into a container to run on multiple nodes in a cloud compute cluster such as on AWS or Google cloud engine. This would also enable you to scale resources according to how much money you want to spend.\n\nDo you think you could share a diagram of the typical workflow here? Maybe with details of the runtime requirements?\n\nCheers,\n\nJohn\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Egan", "created_at": "May 11, 2016 at 10:22AM", "created_by": "JohnEgan", "parent_id": "topic_1381975", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1527996"}
