{"body": "\n1 - what kind of measurement is this? You multiply the total sunlight hours by the surface area? This is not an average in my understanding, it look more like a total something. It would make more sense if you would divide the totals of sun light hours for the surface area, in this case it would be a sort of normalized quantity of sunlight hour per facade (h/m2).\n\n2 - if it is not an average, then why the tooltip say \"average\"\n\n\n\nFrancesco, You're right on both. The reason I picked area * number of hours, which is a nonsense as a value, over the average is that it let's you compare two design options against each other using a single value. The tooltip should get fixed.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 17, 2017 at 6:27pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1673682", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1674111"}
