{"body": "\nI need to evaluate some historical weather data of a little village at Haiti. The only format I can get is XML, JSON or HTML. Is there a way how to feed that data to Ladybug and use it's tools to evaluate it?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now I can only read weather API and get data to Grasshopper using gHowl.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI also found it's possible to create custom epw data file using this SW\u00a0[http://bigladdersoftware.com/projects/elements/](http://bigladdersoftware.com/projects/elements/) but have no idea if it works.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny suggestions?
