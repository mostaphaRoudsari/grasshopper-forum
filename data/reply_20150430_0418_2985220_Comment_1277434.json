{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI followed your advice and cleaned up my surfaces. Only took 8 hours :)\n\n\n\nHowever when I run the simulation I get a lot of \"interzone azimuths do not match\" errors and the simulation fails.\n\n\n\nFrom a little research on the error it seems that the interzone surfaces need to be mirrored surfaces. That is the azimuth needs to be 90.0 on one zone and 270.0 on the other zone for the heat transfer to work correctly. However, after cleaning up my surfaces I always have the same wall in adjacent zones, referenced one for each zone.\u00a0 Does this mean I need to reorient, manually, all adjacent surfaces? Or is there, hopefully, an automated way to do this in Honeybee?\n\n\n\nSorry for the constant questions.\n\n\n\nThank you so much in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 04:18AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1273775", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1277434"}
