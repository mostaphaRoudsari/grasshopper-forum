{"body": "\nRendy,\n\nI would say that this can be a bug, but can't say 100%.\n\nThe thing is that your surface is defined as a ground floor. The HB_setEPZoneCnstr component don't allow to change ground floor construction, but only exterior floor (See attached, white group at the bottom). In the zone definition process the surface was defined as an interior floor (didn't find how to change this in the way you defined the zone).\n\nI defined the zone differently (based on surfaces) and there i could change the surface type and the construction (see white group at the top of the file).\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1248225", "name": "test_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 23, 2015 at 02:18AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1248066", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1248223"}
