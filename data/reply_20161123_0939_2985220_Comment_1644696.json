{"body": "\nHi @djordje\n\n\n\nThanks for the reply. I have some questions about the set up:\u00a0\n\n1. When creating the \"PV SystemSize\", how much does the Base Surface matter? What I am seeing is that the output is not dependent on the input surface and it always produces the same PV Surface. Wouldn't I be able to squeeze more PVs on a larger surface and wouldn't that affect the total kWh output? How can I model that? Do I use Number of Rows for that?\u00a0\n\n2. In the \"Photovoltaics Surface\" component. Is DCtoACderateFactor important? Like I mentioned I am looking at desert climate and I think that my default soiling factor will be more in range of 5.5-5.8 rather than standard 2.\u00a0\n\n3. Should I plug North vector into all components? Is that value propagated, or contained in each component?\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "konrad k sobon", "created_at": "November 23, 2016 at 09:39AM", "created_by": "konradksobon", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1644299", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1644696"}
