{"body": "\nHi Kyle,\n\nThank you for the kind comments. We are so happy to hear that and looking forward for your feedback.\n\nThe issue with residential units is known. Some of the schedules are assigned to none in OpenStudio and should be solved once we update the schedules. I saw that you posted another discussion for the same issue. I will check your file and reply there.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 25, 2014 at 7:25pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1173958", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1175667"}
