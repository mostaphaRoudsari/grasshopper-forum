{"body": "\nHi Mostahpa, thank you so much for your reply.\n\nBy further checking all the illuminance values over the year at all the analysis points, I found that\u00a0illuminance values are kind of the same between two versions (i.e. difference is limited in a acceptable range).\u00a0\n\nBut when\u00a0I further check/verify **the calculation of DLA, UDLI, LightControlProfile (Read Annual Result 1)** by using gh native component based on the above mentioned illuminance values, I found that **the old version (VER 0.0.56) is reasonably right (because good correlation between calculated and verified values exist); but in the new version (VER 0.0.58), there is not any correlations between\u00a0calculated and verified values.**\n\nI assume it might be good for you to have a look at the comparison of the calculated and verified values before your coming new release, in order to avoid the potential mistakes occurred in the\u00a0**Read Annual Result 1\u00a0**component again.\n\n<font size=\"2\">Ps: Please use the attached files in this reply post. I have added the \"let the ladybug/honeybee fly\" components in the\u00a0</font>canvas, which was forgot in my previous post. The simulations will automatically run when you open these files.<font size=\"2\"><br/></font>\n\nThank you once again.\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1439067", "name": "CASE_1(newversion)_box1.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1439068", "name": "CASE_1(oldversion)_box1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "January 15, 2016 at 5:33am", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1439008", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1439065"}
