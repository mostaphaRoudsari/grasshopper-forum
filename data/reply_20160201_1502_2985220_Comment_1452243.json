{"body": "\nHi David,\n\n\n\nI might not be able to fully answer your question as I have no experience with Dialux (my daylighting experience comes from 3DS Max Design). However, the location input, cloudy sky setting and time are all input into the creation of the Standard CIE sky which you use for Daylight Factor calculation. If you are doing a DF calculation, you would require the DF analysis recipe and the Standard CIE sky which has all those inputs which Dialux has.\n\n\n\nHope this helps...\n\n\n\nKind Regards\n\nElly\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "February 01, 2016 at 03:02PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "topic_1451916", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1452243"}
