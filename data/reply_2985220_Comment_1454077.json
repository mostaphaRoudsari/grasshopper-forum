{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nHaving E+ output an SQL file as Abraham states can help you pull aggregate sums/averages of dataset out without having to bring all of the small pieces of data in. \u00a0However, if you want all of the data to come in, SQL is going to take the same amount of time to import to GH as the CSV does. \u00a0So, in the end, there is no better substitute for reducing the amount of time it takes to import the data than to specify only the outputs you are interested in and at the timestep that you need the data at (ie monthly instead of hourly).\n\nThis is one of the reasons why I have been a bit lazy about building out the SQL importing features since, even though it might help improve the import time a bit in a few casese, most of the time I am best off only requesting the outputs that I need or simulating only the portion of the energy model needed to answer the question I am asking.\n\nWhat data and timestep are trying to get in your case here? \u00a0There may be a chance for SQL to help and this could be the excuse that I need to implement some SQL capabilities.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 3, 2016 at 1:21pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1452931", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1454077"}
