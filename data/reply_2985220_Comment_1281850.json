{"body": "\nHi JPE,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for your response, helps clarify things a bit. The articles I've been reading state similar strategies.\n\n\n\nI want to say that I did follow this in my model (hopefully). The way I understand it, in Honeybee, I need to manually breakdown the surfaces that account for ceiling/floors when the floor plan between levels changes. I believe I did that in my model. However, I was not sure (and still not sure) if Honeybee handles the assigning this \"outside\" automatically between zones after the zones have been set on per-surface level.\n\n\n\nThat said, I realize now that I have both exposed floor and exposed ceilings in my model which I wrongly grouped together with all the other floors and ceilings. I will try to remedy that. But given the error log from E+ I think that I have boundary issues in most if not all interfaces between levels (even after I correctly assigned the normals).\n\n\n\nAs I sad in the previous post, not solving adjacencies between levels and simply dragging each solve adjacency output from each level allows me to run the simulation without the fatal errors, but I have to wonder on the validity of my results.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 7, 2015 at 12:16am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1282035", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1281850"}
