{"body": "\nDear Mostapha,\n\nMany thanks for sharing such good work and to include the code! I am just checking it now, but looking at the raytracing component, I haven't been able to make it work, get the message \"Solution exception:Index was outside the bounds of the array\" even with your example file, and the inputs seem OK... Would that be a bug, or would I be doing something wrong?\n\nBest,\n\nR.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rodrigo Velasco", "created_at": "November 17, 2013 at 11:29AM", "created_by": "RodrigoVelasco", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_951667", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_959256"}
