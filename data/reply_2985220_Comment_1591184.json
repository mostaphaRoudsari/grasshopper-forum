{"body": "\nYou are connecting the wrong CSV file (this one only has zone sizing information). You should be getting an output file called eplusout.csv which has all the outputs listed in the IDF file.\n\nIf this eplusout.csv is not being generated, that means that a post-processing command that reads the ESO file and converts it into CSV format isn't being executed (ReadVarsESO.exe). I haven't worked much with DesignBuilder so not sure how it creates the output files -- if it doesn't run ReadVarsESO, then you can always run it manually (see this thread for more info -- [https://unmethours.com/question/15961/output-data-in-csv-format/](https://unmethours.com/question/15961/output-data-in-csv-format/))\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julia S", "created_at": "August 30, 2016 at 2:33pm", "created_by": "JuliaS", "parent_id": "topic_1591077", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1591184"}
