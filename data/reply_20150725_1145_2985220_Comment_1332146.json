{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for these inputs. It would have taken me a while to figure this out by myself by trial and error. As far as the Radiance conference goes, although I am attending and am contributing to a couple of presentations, I m not presenting any of my research over there.\n\n\n\nBy the way, are you looking for any collaborators/developers for the Radiance aspect of Honeybee and Ladybug ? If yes, are there any specific areas that you are interested in developing? I might be able to pitch in with some scripts.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "July 25, 2015 at 11:45AM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1331617", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1332146"}
