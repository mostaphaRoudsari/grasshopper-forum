{"body": "\nHi Claudio\n\n\n\nAfter looking through the code I see that Chris hasn't implemented this functionality. Its pretty easy to do and using additional strings in this case in my opinion would be a nightmare.\n\n\n\nSo I've edited the component and added the setpoints functionality for you. You just need to put the number in the input\u00a0blindsSetpoint_. I haven't tested it thoroughly at this point so let me know on this discussion if you have any issues with it.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1412482", "name": "WindowShadeGenerator w setpoints example AJZ 30.11.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 8:22am", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412443", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412480"}
