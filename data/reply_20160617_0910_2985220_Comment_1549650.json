{"body": "\nHey!\n\nThank you for the reply.\n\nSo, I used the update Honeybee component and now I'm getting a different message:\u00a0\n\n\n\n**\"3. Honeybee cannot find a compatible EnergyPlus folder on your system.**<br/>**Make sure you have EnergyPlus installed on your system.**<br/>**You won't be able to run energy simulations without EnergyPlus.**<br/>**Honeybee supports following versions:**<br/>**V8-4-0, V8-3-0, V8-2-10, V8-2-9, V8-2-8, V8-2-7, V8-2-6, V8-2-5, V8-2-4, V8-2-3, V8-2-2, V8-2-1, V8-2-0, V8-1-5, V8-1-4, V8-1-3, V8-1-2, V8-1-1, V8-1-0\" .**\n\n\n\nSo now it seems like the only version of E+ it doesn't support is V8-5-0. Do I need to uninstall it to set a \u00a0V8-4-0 version?\u00a0\n\nOr maybe this is still not the latest version of Honeybee? Is there is a different way of updating it?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1549652", "name": "honeybee_warning2.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Ana Carolina Moura", "created_at": "June 17, 2016 at 09:10AM", "created_by": "AnaCarolinaMoura", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1549567", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1549650"}
