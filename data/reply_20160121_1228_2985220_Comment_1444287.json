{"body": "\nPietro,\n\nI just wanted to add that, for the view component of the last stable release and all typical uses of the view component into the future, the _geometry will block the view as Mostapha states. \u00a0However, there were two new capabilities that I recently added into the component where I realized you usually do not want the geometry to block the view and so I do not have this _geometry block the view.\n\nThese cases are 'spherical view' and 'horizontal 60 degree cone of vision' which are used primarily for indoor studies when you are trying to maximize overall view to the outdoors (as opposed to view towards a given destination object for which you would use a series of points). \u00a0In these two cases of spherical and cone of vision, your _geometry is usually the plane of vision and so you do not want this plane to block the view.\n\nMy comment here will be more relevant after the next stable release.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 21, 2016 at 12:28PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1444185", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1444287"}
