{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nSorry for responding so late. \u00a0I just changed the way that the additionalStrings input works yesterday since I realized that the previous manifestation made it very difficult to input new lines of text from Grasshopper.\n\nI did not realize that you actually had to change the means by which the window fenestration surface was written into the IDF (not just the construction and the writing of the shading control object).\n\nYou can use the new additional strings input to get around this by not including the window as a HBSurface and writing it separately into the additionalStrings input. You then have to write all of the constructions and materials with the additional strings input. \u00a0Attached you can find your file with the correctly-formatted way of writing the additional lines into the IDF. \u00a0It's a huge hassle to use the shading control object, though, so I would really recommend my previous example.\n\nAlso, I do not know how to write the daylighting control object into the zone and you are going to have to figure that out for me to get this method to work.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1240233", "name": "ThermochromicGlazing_AY_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 10, 2015 at 5:05pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1238133", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240232"}
