{"body": "\nHi Ed,\n\n\n\nHad a similar error a few days ago. If memory serves me well the error is produced when any of your surfaces do not fit in octree.\u00a0 I do not know what type of geometry you are running but if it is a building/room try to include an outside ground plane that stretches beyond your current walls/boundaries. Not sure this will fix it, as my error was a truncate error, but worth to try.\n\n\n\nAlso, perhaps uploading your definition will get you better advice from experts of the forum.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 22, 2015 at 4:35am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1269399", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1269401"}
