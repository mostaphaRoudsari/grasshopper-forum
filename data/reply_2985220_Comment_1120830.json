{"body": "\nHi Dan,\n\nIt looks like you are using everything correctly but Mostapha is right that you have to update with the \"Honeybee_Update Honeybee\" and \"Ladybug_Update Ladybug\"components.\n\nAlso, to clarify, the shading designer component that you initially posted is only meant to produce possible shading geometry off of existing window geometry. \u00a0It is most useful when you want to generate shade geometry for a bunch of windows really fast. \u00a0In order to add properties for daylight and energy simulation to your shade geometry, you use the context component that you posted a picture of.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 24, 2014 at 10:39pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1120688", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1120830"}
