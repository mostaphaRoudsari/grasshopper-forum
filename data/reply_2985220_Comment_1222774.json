{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\nAs far as I understand, the only major difference between the two is that the bounce from surface has you input the geometry that you want to see sun vectors bounce off and automatically generates start points of the sun rays based on a gridSize or density of sun vectors. \u00a0On the other hand, the forward ray tracing makes you input start points for the vectors, forcing you to generate the grid of points yourself.\n\nPersonally, I have usually found the bounce from surface to be more helpful in most cases, particularly in those like the one you are looking at here, since, if you use the gridSize, the number of sunrays getting through will usually have a pretty good correlation to the amount of light getting into the space. \u00a0If you are not getting any sunrays in with the bounce from surface component at a time you expect to be getting them, you should try dropping down the gridSize.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 11, 2015 at 2:16pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1222152", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1222774"}
