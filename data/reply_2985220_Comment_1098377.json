{"body": "\nNice discussion.\n\n\n\nOn \"Potential Models to follow\":\n\n1. Build our own html pages\n\n**pros:** the best custom features\n\n**cons:** some of us, not that much familiar with html, might struggle when creating pages.\n\n\n\n2. Github pages:\n\n**pros:** it has nice search feature recalling those of\u00a0[rhinocommon](http://4.rhino3d.com/5/rhinocommon) one:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/c2nk1pk6akR65Iu2gCBJ*C8eKbeoIyrIEl6V-Is4VWixdcOadzZLAOSFQ15PxY4WTs8LvRVTBEbPVohfe8ueNYiZjHQZoyM0/proba.jpg?width=250\" width=\"250\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/c2nk1pk6akR65Iu2gCBJ*C8eKbeoIyrIEl6V-Is4VWixdcOadzZLAOSFQ15PxY4WTs8LvRVTBEbPVohfe8ueNYiZjHQZoyM0/proba.jpg)\n\nConnection with already present ladybug repository.\n\n**cons:** (personally) I do not like the default github theme. It's too \"coder\" like, white background, black letters. It would be nice if we could change it to some other one.\n\n\n\n3. Free bloggs - wordpress, blogger... (some other ones).<br/>**pros:** That would be visually more appealing than github. It would also allow for more easy creation of pages than \"1. Build our own html pages\". Wordpress even has a feature to support syntax highlighting for python snippets ([sourcecode language=\"python\"]code[/sourcecode]). Blogger might have than one too, with additional mods.\n\n**cons:** both mentioned blogs have a bit \"tricky\" search engines. \"Tricky\" - meaning the searching would not look like in case of github or rhinocommon, by topic names, but it will list the topics along with previews:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/c2nk1pk6akQUk-JjAT5y16uuMsMB5AxHwxhw8iVD*OtuRt8zV8sk605L3sKERWelvIDPEX8E1MFQqxaG3nV1ay4XyYVrBQdI/proba2.jpg?width=250\" width=\"250\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/c2nk1pk6akQUk-JjAT5y16uuMsMB5AxHwxhw8iVD*OtuRt8zV8sk605L3sKERWelvIDPEX8E1MFQqxaG3nV1ay4XyYVrBQdI/proba2.jpg)\n\nNot sure if some additional search module exist for both platforms?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 7, 2014 at 4:52am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "topic_1098315", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1098377"}
