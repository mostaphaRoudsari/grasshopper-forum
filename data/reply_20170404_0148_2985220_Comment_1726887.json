{"body": "\nHi Ji,\n\n\n\nThe component that creates the cumulative sky [returns a Python Class](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/Ladybug_GenCumulativeSkyMtx.py#L330-L339). And the component that receives the cumulative sky [needs that Python class as input](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/Ladybug_selectSkyMtx.py#L188-L193). I don't think native python components can be internalized and retrieved inside Grasshopper. The error you are getting can be traced back to this\u00a0[line](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/Ladybug_selectSkyMtx.py#L189) in the code where the script expects a class with a 'd' attribute.\n\nSo, to answer your question, cumulative matrix cannot be internalized.\n\n\n\n(There is a slight chance that I might be incorrect about this. If so, I hope someone would provide the right answer.)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "April 04, 2017 at 01:48AM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1726800", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726887"}
