{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nI can't seem to replicate your error. \u00a0Attached is a screenshot of what I get with the video 8 example file. \u00a0Is there anything different about your GH file from the example and, if so, could you upload it?\n\n\n\nI know I put in a check to make sure that the faces of the generated mesh and the number of branches in the view factor tree match, which is why you are getting that warning. \u00a0Perhaps you have a geometry case where there is a mesh face generated outside the boundary of the zone?\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1144118", "name": "Everything Ok With Indoor Temperatur Map.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 6, 2014 at 10:02am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1143786", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1144116"}
