{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI have been trying to get an illuminance analysis running, but i get black mesh which is not the wanted result, if i compare it to the results of raytracing for the same hour/day/month. I made sure that the reflective surface is on the side i need, and i also tried to change the hour on the sky because of the bug suggested here ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/ladybug-hours-incorrect?x...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/ladybug-hours-incorrect?xg_source=activity))\u00a0but no luck. Also i cranked up the analysis resolution to every 5mm...nothing\u00a0\n\n\n\nI would much appreciate if anyone can point out mistakes, or explain why it is not working. Here is the gh file and a screenshot. The file should be read in m with a 0.001 tolerance\n\n\n\nThank you\n\nGabriella\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1753364", "name": "HB illuminance problem.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1753365", "name": "HB illuminance problem.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Gabriella Rossi", "created_at": "May 17, 2017 at 8:08pm", "created_by": "GabriellaRossi", "topic": "Honeybee Illuminance analysis FAIL", "id": "topic_1753366"}
