{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha for your reply,\u00a0\n\n\n\nConsider you have sth like DSF zone which is not conditioned but you still have natural ventilation as we could do it as HBplenumZone.. Then it is combined with an implemented solar air heater inside it ,, in which this air heater warms the air inside the zone until a specific temp. and then release it into the adjacent zone .. I was trying to simulate the solar air heater as a black body surface inside the zone but I still can not control the temperature... I hope I could describe the issue clearly .. and I know maybe this is more CFD related matter rather than E+ .. but I wanna try if there is any simplification for it ..\u00a0\n\n\n\nI ll post there also ..,,\u00a0\n\nThanks Mostapha,,\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1702159", "name": "Untitled.png"}], "created_by_name": "AMIR TABADKANI", "created_at": "February 28, 2017 at 3:54am", "created_by": "AMIRTABADKANI", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701513", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1702157"}
