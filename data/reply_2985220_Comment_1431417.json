{"body": "\nHi Saurabh,\n\nCan you check the readMe output and see if there is any error? I ran your file for one test point each zone (just to keep it run fast) and it runs on my machine with no problems. Also some of the surfaces may need to be rebuilt to generate a cleaner mesh and as a result a better grid of test points.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 5, 2016 at 8:28pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1431082", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1431417"}
