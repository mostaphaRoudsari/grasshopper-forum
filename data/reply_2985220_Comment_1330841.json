{"body": "\nThanks for the good response, Abraham. \u00a0To clarify, hitting\u00a0(ctrl+B) sends whatever components that are selected to the back of the canvass so that GH will read those components first when it opens (or re-computes) the file. \u00a0You want LB_LB and HB_HB to be read before any other components on the canvass since these components contain all of the libraries and functions that the other components use. \u00a0When you drop a new LB_LB or HB_HB onto a canvass, it puts the components on the front so you have to select them and hit\u00a0(ctrl+B) to ensure that everything works correctly in the future.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 22, 2015 at 5:08pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1330094", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1330841"}
