{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nI have a small problem when I was using the Microclimate map example file. Following the guidance, I copied the zip file URL to my clipboard and connected to the 'weatherFileURL'. But with an error pop-out: WeatherFileURL is not a valid web address to a DOE weather file.\n\n\n\nIs this because the DOE's website changed?\u00a0\n\n[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_about...](http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_about.cfm)\n\n[https://www.energyplus.net/weather](https://www.energyplus.net/weather)\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!!\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Maria X", "created_at": "January 06, 2016 at 11:17PM", "created_by": "MariaX", "topic": "Problem with loading WeatherFileURL", "id": "topic_1432803"}
