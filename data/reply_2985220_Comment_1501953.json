{"body": "\nHi Misung,\n\n\n\nFirst of all a couple of information about LB components: if you see the inputs, you'll see some underscores on the right side, left side or both side of the words.<br/>Left underscore: you need this to run the component<br/>Right underscore: it is optional<br/>On the both sides means: you need this but there is a default value inside, so if you don't connect a data, the component uses the default value as input.\n\nTo run LB sunlight hours analysis you need\u00a0_geometry,\u00a0_disFromBase,\u00a0_sunVectors,\u00a0_runIt.\n\n\n\nComing back to your issue, Have you set a Brep in Grasshopper? When a component or a parameter becomes orange there is a warning for you.\n\n\n\nI suggest you also take a look at example files on Hydrashare:\n\n[https://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/index.html](https://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/index.html)\n\n\n\nBest\n\nAntonello\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "April 6, 2016 at 2:25am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "topic_1501936", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1501953"}
