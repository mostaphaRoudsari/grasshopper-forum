{"body": "\nHi Dalia,\n\nAs you can see Honeybee needs standard versions of Radiance and Daysim to be installed. It won't load the ones from DIVA or any other customized version. You need to install radiance at c:\\radiance, and daysim at c:\\daysim. If you only want to use glareComponent then you need to download evalglare and copy it to c:\\radiance\\bin.\n\nHere is a fairly old video ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/how-to-get-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/how-to-get-radiance-and-daysim-installed)) and here is a post by James ([http://jramsden271.wordpress.com/2014/04/04/installing-honeybee-for...](http://jramsden271.wordpress.com/2014/04/04/installing-honeybee-for-grasshopper/)).\n\nOnce you have evalglare installed you should be able to run the analysis with no issue.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 6, 2015 at 11:19pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1199967", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1199969"}
