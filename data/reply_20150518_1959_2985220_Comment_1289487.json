{"body": "\nHi Dimitri,\n\n\n\nI had a somewhat similar experience recently. While Rhino did not crash in my case, after assigning glazing percentages my zones would be come open breps. The reason was an internal Rhino bug. I am not sure if that happens in your case as well.\n\n\n\nThe way I used to debug/visualize the issue was to close all previews and open the add glazing component preview. Then, when playing with glazing ratios you will notice that after some value the surfaces will get all funky (top part is chopped, edges are irregular) which leads to open breps. The only \"solution\" was to allow the maximum (in my case maximum was the intention of the exercise) ratio I could before that happened, so that I could get closed breps. I wonder if in your case this happens simultaneously in 100 zones and it (or solving adjacencies on them) crashes Rhino.\n\n\n\nSorry I don't have a better solution. Hope this helps.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 18, 2015 at 07:59PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1289282", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1289487"}
