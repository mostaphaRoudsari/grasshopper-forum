{"body": "\nDear Theodoros,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for the prompt reply and the detailed advice!\n\n\n\nThe following image shows the fvScheme file **before** and **after** running the **update fvScheme** component, and the **fvScheme file you shared** in the above post. The differences are highlighted. Are they correct?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/lQF20yFeYtrM3kg*totMwI-n24YWHp5vkKAkGCvNLVFeDk5hYvreXijXFZz1ghU7nw3FRvOfvIKtfI2787LOCjK4heSJCP3U/Image5.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/lQF20yFeYtrM3kg*totMwI-n24YWHp5vkKAkGCvNLVFeDk5hYvreXijXFZz1ghU7nw3FRvOfvIKtfI2787LOCjK4heSJCP3U/Image5.png)\n\n\n\nI replaced the fvScheme file with the one you shared, and ran the simpleFOAM component. Now, there is no warning, but the simulation didn't converge after the 2000 iterations:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/lQF20yFeYtoT4X-MVYGnSKqRRsgtGnGCFNg3mpSpLg2qAVgW0Z-SrT-b1gg8vJWbM4UeMmegGFTssEBaCjPYo7bykrkEqvRO/Image3.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/lQF20yFeYtoT4X-MVYGnSKqRRsgtGnGCFNg3mpSpLg2qAVgW0Z-SrT-b1gg8vJWbM4UeMmegGFTssEBaCjPYo7bykrkEqvRO/Image3.png)\n\n\n\nthen I changed the number connected to the **_endTime_** from 2000 to 4000, and the simulation continued for another 2000 iterations without any sign of converge ... and then GH freezes completely ... and Rhino+GH has to be shut down ...\n\n\n\nWhile waiting for the team to consider the \"first/second order\" function to be added to the update fvScheme component as you suggested on GitHub, may I ask how to improve the mesh quality before the update fvScheme step?\n\n\n\nThank you very much!\n\n- Ji\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 27, 2016 at 07:57AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1589260", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1589370"}
