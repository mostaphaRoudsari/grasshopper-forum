{"body": "\nHi Anna,\n\n\n\nIlluminance is an additive quantity. Although the spectral composition of illuminance from daylight and electric will vary, we usually ignore that for normal lighting calculations. So, simulating electric lighting and daylighting together essentially involves adding constant electric lighting illuminance values to time-variant daylight illuminance values.\n\n\n\nWithin the context of Honeybee,this will involve running an annual simulation with daysim and then running a separate grid-based calculation with electric lighting and then doing a summation of those values per hour. See the attached gh file.\n\nThis is more or less how DaysimPS and SPOT work.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1675174", "name": "Honeybee_Grid-based_Daylight_Simulation_Example2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "January 19, 2017 at 2:59pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1675133", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1675173"}
