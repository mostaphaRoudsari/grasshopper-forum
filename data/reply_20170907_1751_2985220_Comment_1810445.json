{"body": "\nHi, thank you for developing this awesome tool. Quick question, does Honeybee Plus have the capacity to simulate light shelf or light louver using BSDF file (like in 3-phase or 5-phase calculation)? If so, do I need to create a geometry for the light shelf or louver or just assign it to a window? I'm not sure if those will be seen as honeybee surface, window surface or window group.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "inkmug", "created_at": "September 07, 2017 at 05:51PM", "created_by": "YunaXie", "parent_id": "topic_1802360", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810445"}
