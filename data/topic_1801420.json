{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm finding some inconsistencies in the viewAnalysis component when i check the percentage of a surface seen from a point.\n\nThe point happens to be the sun position. Usually it works fine, but for some specific cases it is giving viewing results for occluded surfaces.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/MKXGwdaYxGGryPAuiELMozfKcbCq-4GNJ0qCA3MXsuu32v73haJ5WfWAF*s5j3VF3HyF5klDMQyuduDC3Zq1hJhvOmBfePon/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/MKXGwdaYxGGryPAuiELMozfKcbCq-4GNJ0qCA3MXsuu32v73haJ5WfWAF*s5j3VF3HyF5klDMQyuduDC3Zq1hJhvOmBfePon/Capture.JPG)You can see from the plan view (top-left) that the line of view can not see the surface, but from the top-right view you can see that some portion of the surface appear as \"seen\" (blue color). At the bottom-right you can see the view from the sun, just to confirm that the surface is occluded.\n\nAttached the file i'm using. In general the results are fine, but just wonder what happens here.\n\nFor those of you interested in such kind of analysis i recommend to set the sunpath scale to a high value.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n\n\n\n\n\na\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1801419", "name": "GSC_00.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 20, 2017 at 11:24pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "[solved]viewAnalysis - Inconsistency", "id": "topic_1801420"}
