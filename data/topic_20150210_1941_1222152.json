At first it sounds obvious, but when I use them, Its less evident.\n\nI'm trying to form a sort of reflector SRF that will bounce the sunlight towards the interior of an atrium. The sun Light should pass through the open area (glazing) of a skylight construction (see image)\n\n\n\nWhich of this two components should I be using. BTW it depends on the time of day and year the BounceFromSurface component returns a non bounce message. While the other (forward ray tracing) does intersects with the reflector geometry.\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\ncheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "February 10, 2015 at 07:41PM", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "Forward Raytracing vs Bounce from Surface", "id": "topic_1222152"}
