I dont know if I defined it with a correct method or not !!!!\n\nPlease \u00a0find attached the file .....\n\nnote : the energy simulation I copied it from another file for testing I think It's not perfect for my case as I got\u00a0\u00a0unconvincing results .\u00a0\n\nwaiting for your reply\u00a0\n\nThank you\u00a0\n\nMona\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1281930", "name": "READY 4ENERGY STUDY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "May 06, 2015 at 11:19PM", "created_by": "monarezk", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1231393", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1281929"}
