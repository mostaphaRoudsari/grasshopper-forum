{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI 've been trying the VSC component and have some questions.\n\nI attach my sample file for your reference.\n\nI am testing some sample windows and simple context volume.\n\nMy first question has to do with the maximum values I should get from the VSC. According to the documentation I find online for CIE sky the maximum value should be 39.6% and for a uniform (cloudy) sky it should be 50%.\u00a0\n\nFor each case I get close to those numbers but not those numbers. I get around 38 for the CIE and and 48.something for the uniform sky.\n\nAlso I would expect that for each window, which has the center point above the roof or the context they would all get the maximum value, irrelevant also of their horizontal location,which is not the case (they have very slight deviations).\n\n\n\nAlso I noticed that I have to reconnect the ptsFileAddress input each time I change the testSurface objects, but probably this is an expected behavior.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, just an idea, are you considering of adding a Radiance Folder Output to the runDaylightAnalysis so we don't repeat with text Concatenation the folder location manually? I understand the idea of separating the two parts of the algorithm and reading the results straight from the folder after they are generated, but for light analysis studies it works pretty fast enough to demonstrate in real-time the effect of design changes.\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nDimitris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1042101", "name": "VSC_Test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "April 10, 2014 at 4:13pm", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Vertical Sky Component Results", "id": "topic_1042102"}
