{"body": "\nHi Mostapha\n\n\n\nThis is Ladan, I hope you are doing well. Congratulation on the great success of your tool! this is amazing! I could see this coming many years ago :) I have one question for you. Can you read the daylighting annual results created by RADIANCE/DAYSIM in your EnergyPlus file and modify the lighting schedule based on the illuminance values calculated by RADIANCE?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you so much\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "October 27, 2016 at 11:27pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "Integrating Daylighting Results to Energy Analysis", "id": "topic_1627843"}
