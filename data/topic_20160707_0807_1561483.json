{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI am making a honeybee based tool to assess daylight factors in rhino. I managed to validate a thin-wall model with results from IES but when I try adding breadth to the walls (basically adding a sill and overhang to the window) my results in rhino diverge, with IES showing DF figures around 20% lower. I modeled the wall thickness as a shading geometry. All radiance parameters are the same between IES and Honeybee.\u00a0\n\nAny chance someone encountered this problem?\u00a0\n\nIs there a good way to account for the wall thickness when doing daylighting sims?\n\n\n\nRegards\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dmitri Korolenko", "created_at": "July 07, 2016 at 08:07AM", "created_by": "DmitriKorolenko980", "topic": "Thick wall model daylight factor simulation", "id": "topic_1561483"}
