{"body": "\nHi Fransesco,\n\n\n\nI assumed you are working in meters and noticed that there were 2 cells per meter in your screenshots which is around 0.5m. For indoors, 0.1-0.2 is a good value so 4 times would get you there.\n\n\n\nThe pressure plot you shared above, it seems like your cell size varies, are you using any gradient options in the blockMesh step? In this example there'd be no need, as all areas are equally important.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf I can see correctly (colors are missing :) ), the impact of mesh quality is already evident. If you compare the two residual plots, the first shows a case that is not converged and seems to be 'stuck in a bad place' where the residuals pulse around a min and max range without decreasing. The second shows the typical pattern of a converging case where residuals steadily decrease.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "November 21, 2016 at 3:23pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1643431", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1643662"}
