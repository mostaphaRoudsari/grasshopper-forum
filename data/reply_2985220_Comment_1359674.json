{"body": "\nHey Chris,\n\nThank you for the great explanation. I think adding the items that you mentioned are pretty useful. Not everybody in the world can really read the chart so I see it as a helpful feature to educate users.\n\n\n\nI also want to add that I emailed Climate Consultant team about their logic behind the polygons and they had their own reasons not to share it. That could be helpful next to their help file. I'm not sure what their algorithms exactly doing.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 10, 2015 at 8:47pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1357150", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1359674"}
