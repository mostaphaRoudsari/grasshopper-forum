{"body": "\nHi Saeran,\n\nVery nice. Very quick.\n\nJust a couple of comments/suggestions, if you don't mind.\n\nThe type hint for the SolarFan month range is missing. Is very helpful to have it.\n\nI prefer to input just one option for the month range. I mean to pick an index for a pre-defined combination of months instead of inputting two numbers. But if you don't agree Option 1 is only Winter Solstice, Option 3 is only Summer Solstice (the hint says it is both seasons).\n\nA typo: Solstice instead of Solistice.\n\n\n\nGreat job and thank you for sharing.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 14, 2014 at 11:17pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1009730", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1009645"}
