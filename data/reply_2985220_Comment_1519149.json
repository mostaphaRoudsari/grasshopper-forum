{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nSorry for the very late response. \u00a0There are very big differences in thermal performance between having a shade on the outside or inside of a window. When the shade is on the inside, the vast majority of the solar heat hitting the shade still ends up inside the building as a heating load. \u00a0On the outside, much of the heat absorbed by the shade is transmitted to the outdoor air and any reflected solar heat is usually out of the equation of the building heat balance (this is not usually the case on the inside). \u00a0So simulating an interior shade as exterior is most likely not accurate.\n\n\n\nI am not sure what an actual wall perforated pattern is. \u00a0Do you mean a bunch of small windows?\n\n\n\nI also don't understand what actual concrete surfaces are as opposed to equivalent thermal mass. \u00a0Are you asking about how E+ defined materials?\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 11:11am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1510311", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519149"}
