{"body": "\nHi Peter,\n\nIn multi-phase analysis if reuse*Mtx is set to True the component will only load the results without running the analysis.\n\n\n\nIn case you want to create your own component, use Human or other plugins to get the list of the results files and then use [this part of the code](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee/blob/47861eae14be1116d4183348a8b63867e356932b/honeybee/radiance/recipe/daylightcoeff/gridbased.py#L307-L342). Replace self.resultFiles with filepaths. You can create the analsysGrids from point files using AnalysisGrid.fromFile class method.\n\n\n\nIf you open\u00a0[an issue](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-grasshopper/issues) I will make sure to add it for the next release.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 28, 2017 at 07:40PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1803018", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1805510"}
