{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI have received this question couple of times and I'm not sure if I know the answer.\n\n\n\nMy suggestion is usually to use Green Building Studio for energy modeling, and then download the .idf file from GBS and import it into Honeybee using importIdf knowing that importIDF just imports the geometry and you need to import materials, constructions, and schedules separately so it is not fun at all.\n\n\n\nI don't know how many users are using REVIT &gt; Honeybee workflow but if it is a common workflow then we should get importIdf fixed soon.\n\n\n\nAnybody on the list has a better solution that they use?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 27, 2014 at 09:56PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "topic": "What is the best practice to import Revit models for energy modeling with Honeybee?", "id": "topic_1177037"}
