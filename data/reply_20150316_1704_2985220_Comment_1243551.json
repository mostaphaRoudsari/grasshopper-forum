{"body": "\nDear Mostapha\u00a0\n\n\n\nthanks for your reply but i could not implement it well, and i wish that the below information will be sufficient to help, bcz this is really important to me and otheres who deals with Horticulture and Landscape in same time.\n\nThe most common plastic materials\u00a0used as agricultural films are the\u00a0low density polyethylene (LDPE, with a\u00a0density less than 0.93 kg m\u22123), the copolymer\u00a0of ethylene and vinyl-acetate (EVA)\n\nAlso here you can find the characteristics of the flexible materials for greenhouse covers (adapted from CPA, 1992\u00a0and Tesi, 2001) as much as i get.\n\n\n\nUV-PE\u00a0Film ( UV-PE~\u00a0polyethylene\u00a0Long life or UV)\n\nThickness (mm) =\u00a00.18\n\nDirect PAR transmissivity (%) =\u00a090\n\nDiffuse PAR transmissivity (%)=\u00a086\n\nLong-wave IR transmissivity (%)=\u00a065\n\n\n\nEVA Film ( EVA~Ethylene vinyl-acetate copolymer)\u00a0\n\nThickness (mm) =\u00a00.18\n\nDirect PAR transmissivity (%) =\u00a090\n\nDiffuse PAR transmissivity (%)=\u00a076\n\nLong-wave IR transmissivity (%)=\u00a027\n\n\n\nand here you will find the global heat transfer coefficient\u2019 (K in W m\u22122 \u00b0C\u22121) for the above greenhouse covering materials, measured under normalized conditions (temperatures: exterior: \u221210\u00b0C, interior: +20\u00b0C, wind: 4 m s\u22121).

It is accepted that the\u00a0PAR radiation ranges from 400 to 700 nm (McCree, 1972), although some authors consider\u00a0the PAR from 350 to 850 nm.\u00a0\n\nThe composition of the radiation\u00a0changes with time, as a function of the Sun\u2019s\u00a0elevation and the cloudiness. When the\u00a0Sun is low over the horizon, the short\u00a0wavelengths\u00a0are reduced (less UV and more\u00a0red). The clouds reduce the amount of\u00a0energy, greatly decreasing the NIR.\n\n**The PAR\u00a0proportion in relation to the global radiation\u00a0increases with scattering (diffusion).\u00a0It is lower with clear sky and in the summer\u00a0(45\u201348%).**\n\n\u00a0\n\nkind regards\u00a0\n\nrafat\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rafat Ahmed", "created_at": "March 16, 2015 at 05:04PM", "created_by": "RafatAhmed", "parent_id": "topic_1242464", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1243551"}
