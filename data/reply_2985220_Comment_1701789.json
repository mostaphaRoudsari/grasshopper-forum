{"body": "\nI agree with Mostapha. The Daysim glare calcs are not very reliable. Since vertical measurements are one of the variables in those calculations, the Daysim sky-model is not very reliable for it. You will be better off iterating through point-in-time calcs instead of relying on Daysim.\n\nOn the error front, I remember Paige having somewhat of a similar issue with her calcs last year.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "February 27, 2017 at 7:42pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701784", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701789"}
