{"body": "\nHi Folks\n\n\n\nLooking for help installing OpenFoam so it runs on a Windows 10 machine.\u00a0\n\nHave installed the butterfly/OpenFoam combo on my machine at work - Windows 7, with no real problem. Followed procedure here: \u00a0[http://www.openfoam.com/download/install-binary-windows.php](http://www.openfoam.com/download/install-binary-windows.php)\u00a0\n\nThis I found by following the instructions here:\n\n[https://github.com/ladybug-tools/butterfly/wiki/Getting-started-wit...](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/butterfly/wiki/Getting-started-with-butterfly-in-grasshopper)\n\n\n\nHOWEVER:\n\nAt home here on my newer, faster Windows 10 machine - no such luck. This is becoming quite frustrating as I feel I am failing some obscure intelligence test.\n\n\n\nI have attached what I suspect is the likely problem identifier - not that it has helped me identify the fix. What I believe is the salient message is appears in the OF_Env_Create Powershell Window (Running as Administrator) , which is step 3 on the Windows 10 special instructions found here:\n\n[https://github.com/ladybug-tools/butterfly/wiki/Windows-10-Installa...](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/butterfly/wiki/Windows-10-Installation-Notes) \u00a0\n\n\n\nThe message (in red as can be seen in the attached picture) states:\n\n\n\nSet-ExecutionPolicy : Windows PowerShell updated your execution policy successfully, but the setting is overridden by a \u00a0policy defined at a more specific scope. Due to the override, your shell will retain its current effective execution\u00a0policy of \"Unrestricted\". Type \"Get-ExecutionPolicy -List\" to view your execution policy settings.
