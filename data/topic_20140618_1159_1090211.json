{"body": "\nOk I manage to\u00a0produce DLA analysis. But I still have a question.\n\nIn the definition of DLA ([http://patternguide.advancedbuildings.net/using-this-guide/analysis...](http://patternguide.advancedbuildings.net/using-this-guide/analysis-methods/daylight-autonomy)) As well as in The daylight handbook I [http://thedaylightsite.com/daylighting-handbook-i/](http://thedaylightsite.com/daylighting-handbook-i/)) which I recommend to everyone interested in daylight metrics. The definition always talks about 50% of the occupancy period. In HB the component only returns the DLA as a % of the Occ. Period.\n\nIs the 50% of Occ.Period required or DLA can also work as given by the HB component?\n\n\u00a0\n\nthank you all\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "June 18, 2014 at 11:59AM", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "Daylight Autonomy", "id": "topic_1090211"}
