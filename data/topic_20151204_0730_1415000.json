{"body": "\nHello all,\n\nI'm trying to obtain an luminance image with ISO line values over it.\n\nIf I use the Honeybee_FalseColor comand I can obtain the ISOline using a toggle on Countour lines. The ISOlines will appear but the image become too exposed (white).\n\nIf I adjust the exposure of the image it will be fine but the ISOlines will lose brightness.\n\n\n\nThese is a way to obtain this without using photoshop?\n\n\n\nAnother question. There is a way to increase the DPI definition of an image I get from an Image Based Simulation?\n\n\n\nI'm attaching some images.\n\n\n\nThank you all for the attention,\n\n\n\nAlessandro\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1414997", "name": "unnamed_IMG_interno.GIF_1.GIF"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1414998", "name": "unnamed_IMG_interno@fc_cl.GIF"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1414999", "name": "unnamed_IMG_interno@fc_cl.TIF"}], "created_by_name": "Alessandro Corso", "created_at": "December 04, 2015 at 07:30AM", "created_by": "AlessandroCorso", "topic": "Luminance image with ISO line and image definition", "id": "topic_1415000"}
