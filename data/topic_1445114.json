{"body": "\nHi everybody!\n\n\n\nI'm here to ask for a tip on how to use the command \"Glazing based on ratio\".\n\nIn my design I have either straight and curved facades.\n\nI've read the descripion on the command and it says that the surfaces has to be planar and on the straight facades the command perfectly\u00a0works.\n\nThe problem is that on the curved once, the same command generate directly one continuous window as happens when I activate the \"break up window\" input.\n\n\n\nIs there any way to generate a series of windows on a curved surface instead of a single one? Or any way to get a result closer to the one I want?\n\n\n\nThank you for the attention,\n\n\n\nI'll attach the gh file.\n\n\n\nAlessandro Corso\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1445113", "name": "GlazingRatioAlessandro.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alessandro Corso", "created_at": "January 22, 2016 at 4:33am", "created_by": "AlessandroCorso", "topic": "Glazing based on ratio issue", "id": "topic_1445114"}
