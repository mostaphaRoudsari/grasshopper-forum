{"body": "\nHello All,\n\n\n\nI have done urban MRT calculations by using Chris's script on Hydra as a base.\u00a0\n\nNow I am confronted with a scenario in which I need to do MRT calc for a shaded Food Center with a lot of food stalls. What I don't know is if its possible to model those food stalls/boxes with a heat load (because of the cooking) and heat load from the occupants and lighting load.\n\nWould be really helpful to know if gh has the option to integrate such loads in the MRT calc. If not then will have to do it in IES.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nSaket\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saket Sarupria", "created_at": "March 21, 2017 at 02:16AM", "created_by": "SaketSarupria", "topic": "Equipment, occupancy and lighting load in MRT", "id": "topic_1717004"}
