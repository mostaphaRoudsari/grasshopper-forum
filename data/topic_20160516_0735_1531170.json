{"body": "\nHi everyone!\n\n\n\nI guess I went through all the display options in Grasshopper, but actually nothing works.\n\n\n\nI want to turn off or hide all the lines (\"edges\", \"hidden geometry\") of Ladybug charts to preview it just like some of the tutorials show (where the charts present clean faces with no edges), but not lucky enough to do so.\n\n\n\nCan somebody give a suggestion how to do it?\n\nDoes it depend more on the Rhino display settings? If yes, then which option exactly, f.ex. in shaded view?\n\n\n\nMany thanks!\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1531168", "name": "01_faces.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1531169", "name": "02_edges.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Jacek Urbanowicz", "created_at": "May 16, 2016 at 07:35AM", "created_by": "JacekUrbanowicz", "topic": "Ladybug & Honeybee charts clean display", "id": "topic_1531170"}
