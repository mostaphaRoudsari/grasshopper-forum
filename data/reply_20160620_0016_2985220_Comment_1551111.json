{"body": "\nHi Saeran\n\nThe component you sent through says ver 0.0.62 (Mar_17_2016). The github one is ver 0.0.62 (jun_07_2016). Is this correct? If so can you update the github component pls.\n\n\n\nAlso can the month range be modified to just take a standard Ladybug analysis period? The month range is a bit misleading because it is preset to the 21st of leach month.\n\n\n\nI still don't think it is what i am after. The required hours should be 2. But the analysis period should be between 9am-3pm. At the moment, If I use 2 hrs for the required hours it will take it from 11am-1pm correct?\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul Wintour", "created_at": "June 20, 2016 at 12:16AM", "created_by": "PaulWintour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1540347", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1551111"}
