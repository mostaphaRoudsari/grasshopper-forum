{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\nThanks. I added you to the repository!\n\nOutdoor examples are good too and is what we initially did for the other project but for the first template I want to keep it as simple as possible so we don't need much power for development and testing. My laptop won't even be able to generate the mesh and load it for an outdoor study! That's why I think we should start with 2D and indoor 3D first and once the workflow is developed we'll move to outdoor analysis.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 21, 2015 at 10:58am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1329870", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1329905"}
