{"body": "\nHi Everybody,\n\n\n\nI imported some buildings from an urban landscape from GIS to Rhino.\u00a0\n\nThe buildings are located in their real locations (x,y). I need to use the real time radiation analysis tool. I set the breps but the tool does not work. However, when I move those buildings to the 0,0 coordinate, the tool works. How can I fix this?\u00a0\n\nP.S. the building layer is attached.\n\n\n\nthanks,\n\nMehdi\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1257372", "name": "3dBuildings.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Mehdi P.
