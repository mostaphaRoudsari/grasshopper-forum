{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nSorry for getting back so late. \u00a0Very busy week with midterms here. \u00a0I have this whole weekend blocked off for updating, though :)\n\n1. I just fixed the bug in ColorZones such that you can now connect up lists of data that do not include values for all connected zones (and vice versa). \u00a0 Everything should be good now in these cases (see attached image of my parent's house with an unconditioned attic).\n\nAs for the issue with the MRT temperature map, I am looking into it now. \u00a0Will post back shortly.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1154493", "name": "Fixed Unconditioned Zones.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 23, 2014 at 12:55pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1152010", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1154492"}
