{"body": "\nVery interesting, thank you for the release of Honeybee[+]!!\u00a0\n\nIs it possible to get an explanation of the installation procedure?\n\nI have few questions:\n\n- do I need to copy the userObjects in the relative GH folder? Together with the other Honaybee and Ladybug .ghuser files.\n\n- or running the installer from the .gh file is enough?\n\n- do we need to do something specific with the python files in the honeybee and ladybug folders? Or are they the installation files that are automatically installed through the installer?\n\n- why there is also a ladybug folder?\n\n- since it is possible to keep installed both Honeybee and\u00a0Honeybee[+] and the latter use Radiance 5.1.0 we need/can keep also both the version of radiance installed? I think not because the folder name should be C:\\Radiance in any case. This means that also Honeybee works with\u00a0Radiance 5.1.0?\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "August 23, 2017 at 4:17am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "topic_1802360", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1802374"}
