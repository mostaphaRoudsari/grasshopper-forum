The outputs that you need are: \"Ebeam\", \"Ediffuse\", \"Eground\".<br/>They contain annual hourly values for each tilt and azimuth combination (that's what upper mesh vertices represent) in a data tree.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1569626", "name": "TOF_Eb_Ediff_Eground.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 21, 2016 at 10:29AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1569460", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1569625"}
