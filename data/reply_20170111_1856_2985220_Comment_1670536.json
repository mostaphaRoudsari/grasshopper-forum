{"body": "\nMathias,\n\nGlad that you find it useful and that's a good idea with the average component.\n\nThere really should be an option to plug points into the sunlight hours component but it does not exist at the moment (I know that it will exist in the next revision of Ladybug). \u00a0How are you generating your custom points right now? (or are you manually creating them?) \u00a0I have a workaround that can generate surfaces from the points if all else fails.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 11, 2017 at 06:56PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1669999", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1670536"}
