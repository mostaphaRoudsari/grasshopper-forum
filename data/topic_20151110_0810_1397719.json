{"body": "\nHi, I'm not much familiar with Honeybee and I'm having some trouble with Honeybee energy simulation.\n\nI can't get any data from Honeybee_Read EP Result component for simulating a cylinder form. How can I fix it?\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/13SlHjEdb8M7siNJ8wgEZpJH*6qutrnDF8jEwOXhfeKgzELgbelMCHzb3IEu**uYce*7vunRyBiQjQEt1Z-nr*S3qpKdWhiC/Untitled.jpg\" width=\"667\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/13SlHjEdb8M7siNJ8wgEZpJH*6qutrnDF8jEwOXhfeKgzELgbelMCHzb3IEu**uYce*7vunRyBiQjQEt1Z-nr*S3qpKdWhiC/Untitled.jpg)\n\n\n\nAnd one more thing, In what order the mass is divided into different zones? How can I understand each zone number is representing which part of the building?\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Farnoosh Namdarpour", "created_at": "November 10, 2015 at 08:10AM", "created_by": "FarnooshNamdarpour", "topic": "Cylinder Energy Simulation and HBZones", "id": "topic_1397719"}
