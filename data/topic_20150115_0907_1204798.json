{"body": "\nWanted a little help with a radiation study wasn't sure if I was going about it the wrong way. The attached ladybug file generates a correct ( I assume ) radiation map but when I add the solar shades, as the context, it seems to not calculate the radiation correctly.\u00a0The radiation then reads\u00a0as a\u00a0consistent gradient across the fa\u00e7ade.\u00a0I use the shades as the context in the analysis maybe there is a better way to go about this study, do I need to adjust the grid size? Any help would be appreciated.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1204797", "name": "NEIU radaiton.gh"}], "created_by_name": "jim reisiger", "created_at": "January 15, 2015 at 09:07AM", "created_by": "jimreisiger", "topic": "radation problems", "id": "topic_1204798"}
