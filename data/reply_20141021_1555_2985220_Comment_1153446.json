{"body": "\nThank you for the quick response Abraham. I too was able to use existing ep materials from the ep library to run the simulation with success. However, I'd like to be more specific and manipulate the glass properties. I was under the impression that I could create my own glazing material and glazing construction and then save it into the library. Then simulate using the saved material and construction. Are you saying that even by using the \"add to energyplus library\" component, I won't be able to run a simulation with custom materials? If so is there any way to manipulate the three definitions (U, SHGC and VT) of the \"Theoretical Glass (167)\" that you've used?\u00a0\u00a0How else do I define my own custom glass material?\n\n\n\nI recently watched chris mackey's tutorial -&gt;\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTnwMuadjyE&amp;list=UUc6HWbF4UtdKd...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTnwMuadjyE&amp;list=UUc6HWbF4UtdKdjbZ2tvwiCQ&amp;index=5)<br/>\n\n\n\nFrom this I thought I could use custom materials in a simulation.\n\n\n\nYour response is much appreciated in advance,\n\nAaron\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "October 21, 2014 at 03:55PM", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1153385", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1153446"}
