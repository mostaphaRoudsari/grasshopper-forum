{"body": "\nChris,\n\nThank you for testing this. It does look like a proper sky.\n\nBut yes, there is definitely still error introduced by the inconsistent data between the days of the year\n\n\n\nChris I was wondering if Ladybug (or any other tools that work with grasshopper) can create a solar radiation source with a given W/m^2 value.\u00a0\n\nTo elaborate, something that would also be useful to me would be to use the Sun Path component, select a given month, day, hour to determine a sun location. Then use that sun location as a direct radiation source of specified value.\n\nI looked over the available components, but did not see anything that matches this, but then again I am new to Grasshopper so maybe there is something I can do to achieve this.\n\n\n\nAlso, maybe it is worth starting a new thread for this question. Let me know that would be best and I will post as new thread for you to reply.\n\n\n\nThanks again,\n\nMike\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mike Johnson", "created_at": "March 17, 2017 at 2:22pm", "created_by": "MikeJohnson", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714684", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714860"}
