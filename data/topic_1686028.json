{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nWe've been working with grid base simulation for a while and now we want to use radiance to generate 'quick' image of artificial lighting design but when using multiple CPUs the image seems to be divided and doesn't look good. While using 1 CPU achieves the objective the time is too slow.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nJuan Carlos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Juan Carlos Fornino", "created_at": "February 6, 2017 at 5:39am", "created_by": "JuanCarlosFornino", "topic": "Is it possible to run a HB image base simulation with multiple CPU for artificial lighting design?", "id": "topic_1686028"}
