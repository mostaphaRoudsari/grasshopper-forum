{"body": "\nHi Anna,\n\n\n\nWe ended up only conducting a point in time illluminance and not an annual simulation.\n\n\n\nEven though these daylight systems do not produce a lot of daylight as Chris identified, the IES file was running low relative to what it should be producing. This was verified after plugging the IES file into AGi32, the light levels were higher (see attached). The IES file itself had to be adjusted (the manufacturer of a different IES file for another daylight harvesting system said other modelers also have had to alter their files for Radiance to read properly). Once I plugged in the new IES file, it ran great with comparable levels to AGi32. I will try to find out more about how the IES file was manipulated.\n\n\n\nIf you are not having trouble with your IES file that's good, but I would check with the manufacturer to make sure the light levels you are receiving are accurate. Sorry I can't be of more help for the annual simulation at this time.\n\n\n\nChris &amp; Sarith,\n\nThank you both for your responses! Once I find out more about the changes made to the IES file I will post more. \u00a0I do know that PhotometricToolbox was utilized to make them.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nCharlene\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1675388", "name": "Sunluminaire.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Charlene Mendez", "created_at": "January 20, 2017 at 10:38AM", "created_by": "CharleneMendez", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1675173", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1675386"}
