{"body": "\nHi everybody!\n\nBefore asking a new question i would like to thank you all for all the support you are giving through this page! Thanks a lot!!\n\nI would like to ask you if there is a way to plot\u00a0EnergyPlus results (like Zone Operative Temperature, Zone Windows Total Transmitted Solar Radiation Rate..) in Rhino.. I mean , i would like to see those results as i can see the Daylight Factor after a daylight simulation.\n\nBecause i remember to have seen a video, showing something similar.. is it possible?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 22, 2016 at 10:24AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Plotting EnergyPlus results", "id": "topic_1553823"}
