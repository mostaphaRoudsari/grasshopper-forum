{"body": "\nHi Tristan,\n\nUnfortunately, the easily-achievable goal that I am working towards right now will output the HBObjects into a binary file and will use [python pickle](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html)\u00a0to do so. \u00a0I would really like to enable the serialization to something that is text-readable like XML or JSON for all of the uses that you reference. \u00a0However, this may be difficult for the current (legacy) version of Honeybee that is deeply intertwined with Rhino objects. \u00a0Needles to say, this is something that we are keeping in mind for [Honeybee-Plus](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-plus)\u00a0and I am positive that we will support serialization to these formats at some point in that version.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 30, 2017 at 10:12am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1776550", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1776703"}
