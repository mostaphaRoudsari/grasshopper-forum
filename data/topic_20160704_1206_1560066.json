{"body": "\nHi there,\n\n\n\nI'm new here and this is my first post. I have recently started learning and working with rhino, grasshopper and ladybug honeybee for my internship so I'm just starting.\n\n\n\nI have successfully ran a simulation on this project (which I have simplified with everything internalized) [WindowExample.gh](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fmI0IjC-I3OqCNHEoFkSNlSre12ctxjNT7q*W2YJxHe*uxR0Rn0R9p-X7QxnBYkJJhNRIw6AWnbVS8kevNsJRpQPIr4stEH5/WindowExample.gh) however some of the windows don't seem to display correctly as you can see here:\n\n[<img class=\"align-right\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fmI0IjC-I3NJ0enX6OupmIeEyrBRDudaj53LlQyrc3DElxorDewu36wHP-KZSDWGRM1lc3Q2mOmUyXcao0TotUwekcU1UIpY/Capture1.PNG?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fmI0IjC-I3NJ0enX6OupmIeEyrBRDudaj53LlQyrc3DElxorDewu36wHP-KZSDWGRM1lc3Q2mOmUyXcao0TotUwekcU1UIpY/Capture1.PNG)\n\n\n\nMy question is: is this an actual error that will affect the simulation or is it just glitch when displaying the windows?\n\n\n\nThe file might seem a little strange as I have built \"frames\" to host the window surfaces. I did this because I was getting some errors that made the simulation fail and after some research I found it was because I needed to have some space between the window and the edge of the surface hosting it.\n\n\n\nHere is a preview of the file: [<img class=\"align-right\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fmI0IjC-I3M2mXp1RCVuWYbNelDrLNR9zwZ2QlHZyTI-SV93bivoUObtimm0x5oYM*8AGpAc6G9OtwTiSmigu77OnEIebGaQ/Capture2.PNG?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fmI0IjC-I3M2mXp1RCVuWYbNelDrLNR9zwZ2QlHZyTI-SV93bivoUObtimm0x5oYM*8AGpAc6G9OtwTiSmigu77OnEIebGaQ/Capture2.PNG)\n\n\n\nPS. I tried searching this to not multipost but I counldn't find anything.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1560063", "name": "Window Example.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1560064", "name": "Capture1.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1560065", "name": "Capture2.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Nicholas Ziglio", "created_at": "July 04, 2016 at 12:06PM", "created_by": "NicholasZiglio", "topic": "Certain windows with addHBGlz don't seem to display correclty", "id": "topic_1560066"}
