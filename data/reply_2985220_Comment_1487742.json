{"body": "\nThanks Chris! This has been a great help.\n\n\n\nI'm actually not too concerned about the window orientation. Although the I don't think the physics is quite as simple as you suggest due to the position of coatings, interlayers, position of air cavities, etc., orientation afterwards seems to work without too much hassle.\n\n\n\nHowever, the component is still too strict for a quick to Rhino to Therm workflow:\n\n\n\n1. Geometry connected to _polygons does not have a single boundary (there are holes in the model). <br/> These holes will cause THERM to crash. <br/> Note that air gaps in your model whould be represented with a polygon having an 'air' material.\n\nI'd like to use the paint bucket tool in Therm to fill voids rather than try to do it in grasshopper because it's a lot more difficult to write an algorithm to detect these voids than it is to simply click on them.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlso (I'm not sure this warrants another thread), when I try to add an input to the \"workingDir\" of the writeTHERM, I get this error:\n\n1. Solution exception:unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'str'\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Derin Yilmaz", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 10:26am", "created_by": "DerinYilmaz", "parent_id": "topic_1484413", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1487742"}
