{"body": "\nAlessandro,\n\nI'm not clear about your question. Do you have difficulties creating the materials or do you want to know about Radiance parameters to see the effect of multiple bounces.\n\nFor the material your best bet is to find the values from a measurement. Is there a company that you're using their material. They might have an accurate measurement or a BSDF file for their product.\n\nFor the second part of the question check [Andy's approach](http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2014-london/presentations/day1/McNeil_BSDFsandPhases.pdf)\u00a0to model a light-pipe using 3Phase method. It's not possible to run a 3-Phase daylight analysis with Honeybee at this point. :|\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 9, 2015 at 8:15am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1417342", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1418137"}
