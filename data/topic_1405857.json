{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI have a question regarding metrics to measure glare potential, but for an external environment.\n\n\n\nI was looking at the Honeybee example file for Glare Analysis and also this page here:\n\n[http://web.mit.edu/tito_/www/Projects/Glare/GlareRecommendationsFor...](http://web.mit.edu/tito_/www/Projects/Glare/GlareRecommendationsForPractice.html)\n\n\n\nThe range of values in this page for imperceptible, perceptible, disturbing and intolerable glare make sense to me. My question is, however, are these ranges still applicable when you shift to an external environment? When the sun is out, the external environment is much brighter in comparison. And so I am getting DGP values closer to 0.7 or 0.8, which probably does not make sense because now everything is classified as glare. So, what metric would I use to figure out if, for example, a glass tower is actually creating glare for the people on the street? Should I be looking at the contrast among the luminance values in the scene? Or maybe just sunrays reflected directly by the building onto a specific spot?\n\n\n\nAny thoughts would be helpful.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nSaurabh\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saurabh Shrestha", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 5:55pm", "created_by": "SaurabhShrestha", "topic": "Glare for External Environment", "id": "topic_1405857"}
