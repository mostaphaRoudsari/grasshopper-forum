{"body": "\nHi Chris, Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for your replies. I couldn't check earlier this week but I did today. I am not sure though after I change the temperatures in the IDF editor what happens (should I save as new object?) cause I simulated again and didn't find differences in the results. Indeed is interesting to see how we could do this overwrite through Honeybee. One issue regarding water temperatures throughout the year is that the available data are limited and differ from place to place even within a region. Another interesting point, since the area that is enclosed under water will be a living space is to see how we could simulate the heat gains from the direct sun on the underwater surface, if any, and how we could simulate also the heat exchange between the space and the water body. Would this follow the sae behaviour as the heat exchange between inside and outside air?\n\n\n\nThanks again!\n\n\n\nTasos\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 12, 2015 at 10:13AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1220184", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223374"}
