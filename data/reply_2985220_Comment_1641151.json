{"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\n\n\nGreat thanks for your immediate reply. Wow, that sounds cool, thank you very much for your patient work. Hope to see the result soon.\n\n\n\nI re-run the gh file and met the same problem above. I stopped the calculation and checked the error step with parameters setting which caused to crash of zones. Interestingly, the model acted well after I double-clicked the boolean toggle to create zone again. That really confused me.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo hope to hear from you Devang with good news, and hope some guys help me to find out the problems.\n\n\n\nXiaojian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "November 17, 2016 at 2:25am", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1640992", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1641151"}
