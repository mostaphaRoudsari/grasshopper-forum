{"body": "\nThank you very much, Chris, for implementing this!\n\n\n\nI tested your workflow using Singapore's weather file, and here's the results:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/S8fITn3IbtvTki*UPRuoQx2NOMzQS7wV-yWMlMllEu8mJvmHZ0iI2S6ANVdqDqpy4KoFRmwlTA*ariatqld6N0xC70otCMXX/Image5.png\" width=\"648\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/S8fITn3IbtvTki*UPRuoQx2NOMzQS7wV-yWMlMllEu8mJvmHZ0iI2S6ANVdqDqpy4KoFRmwlTA*ariatqld6N0xC70otCMXX/Image5.png)\n\nSeems the fan electricity energy is a bit higher here, but still relatively lower than natural ventilation heat lost as you pointed out.\n\n\n\nBased on the image above, one suggestion here is that: will it be better if the order of the colors in the legend bar is consistent with that of the color patches shown for each month? I.e. from top to bottom, the items in the color legend bar are people, lights, fan, equipment ... cooling, storage.\n\n\n\nJust a suggestion. Thanks, again, for your prompt assistance!\n\n-Ji\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 09, 2016 at 10:28PM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579619", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579366"}
