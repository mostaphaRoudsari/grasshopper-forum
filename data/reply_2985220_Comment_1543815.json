{"body": "\nDjordje and all following,\n\n\n\nI have finished editing the Solar Adjusted Temperature component to use the EPW down-welling infrared radiation instead of trying to calculate this from sky cover and humidity. \u00a0I also realized an error in my previous validation, which I have corrected in the attached GH file and has resulted in better overall agreement between the\u00a0Maykut/Church model that Djordje posted here and the EPW data. \u00a0It seems that the only major difference between the two is that the\u00a0Maykut and Church model seems to be overestimating the long wave radiation loss to the sky in very cold conditions. \u00a0Otherwise the models show fairly good agreement:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/kpFJ*-3TpnuZgM1dC1CfH5sMytP*tnVkKomxpaT5Uf3i7yxos-qQibNC9O-K5oYSaeML6e8XFjjSVIaKzUQgqcUTSu58HHF9/ValidationofDownwellingRad.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/kpFJ*-3TpnuZgM1dC1CfH5sMytP*tnVkKomxpaT5Uf3i7yxos-qQibNC9O-K5oYSaeML6e8XFjjSVIaKzUQgqcUTSu58HHF9/ValidationofDownwellingRad.JPG)\n\n\n\nFor the benefit of all following the post, I have also posted a comparison between the thermal indices component MRT and the Solar Adjusted MRT:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/kpFJ*-3Tpnsp8nTJMp4wXPIqFBDbeRuzdhFucIJc5HpE2kVwUXZRNupu3vvrfPPBw7SgN7LZHbfkMMF96XlTKO231C*0kTd7/ComparisonofMRTCalculating.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/kpFJ*-3Tpnsp8nTJMp4wXPIqFBDbeRuzdhFucIJc5HpE2kVwUXZRNupu3vvrfPPBw7SgN7LZHbfkMMF96XlTKO231C*0kTd7/ComparisonofMRTCalculating.JPG)\n\n\n\nIn the end, the change introduced by using the recorded EPW downwelling radiation is relatively small and the biggest difference between the two components is still the shortwave radiation calculation, which is larger in the SolarCal model resulting in higher MRT values during the day.\n\n\n\nNow I only have to update the comfort maps and my components should be in a good place. \u00a0I'll post back here once it's done.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1543816", "name": "AddDownwellingRad.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 7, 2016 at 8:08pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1543496", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1543815"}
