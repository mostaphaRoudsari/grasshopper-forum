{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\ni\u00b4m facing another issue. Now that my model has got a certain level of complexity the energy+ sim crashes rhino. I tried several ways to fix this and during that i found that it already crashes while decomposing my HBZones with adjacencies. (which i think energy+ also does, while writing an idf?)\n\nFirst i thought it crashes due to the complexity, but even if i try decomposing only one zone i get the same result.\n\nThen i thoughtit could appear because of the tolerance for adjacencies, but setting the tolerance higher didn\u00b4t affect the result\n\nAnd strangly the crash only occurs after the fourth time of solving adjancencies. (i need to solve the adjacencies step by step for getting Air Walls at curtain adjacencies)(see attached file)\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nDominik[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Nt3y2sZ1kkhdI11ZC5u9QbEVm*4deVg*Z83qwlZVFUxw2j5SaG*inpiz5ouNx5YuiorL9dFLeRSJnaFmd0Nq3*O1Tib2eRFw/decompose_HBZone_crash_overview.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Nt3y2sZ1kkhdI11ZC5u9QbEVm*4deVg*Z83qwlZVFUxw2j5SaG*inpiz5ouNx5YuiorL9dFLeRSJnaFmd0Nq3*O1Tib2eRFw/decompose_HBZone_crash_overview.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1770239", "name": "170616_decompose_crash.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dominik Simon", "created_at": "June 16, 2017 at 10:39AM", "created_by": "DominikSimon", "parent_id": "topic_1768377", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1770237"}
