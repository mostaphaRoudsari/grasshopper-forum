{"body": "\nDear Expert,\n\n\u00a0\n\nI created a set of custom materials for a E+ simulation that I then used to define a set of EPCostructions. Once added to the E+ library,\u00a0I checked the UValue constructions (with HB call from EP library) in W/m2K which did not correspond to the values calculate by me using the standard equation U=1/R with R= \u03a3 thickness/conductivity. I tried the calculation both with and without the external and internal resistivity (Rse, Rsi) but the results are in any case different.\n\nThe results are the same only if I set in each materials that compose the construction 0 for density and specific heat, that means a construction without mass.\n\nUnfortunately, I did not find any literature about! Could you explain how HoneyBee (or perhaps E+) does the U-value calculation?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nGiuseppe\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "September 9, 2015 at 2:32am", "created_by": "GiuseppeDM", "topic": "UValue EPConstruction calculation", "id": "topic_1357076"}
