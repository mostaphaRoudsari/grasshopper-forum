{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\nThe simple answer is not. You don't need to connect the geometry also as context. The Context affects the geometry, but not viceversa. The Geometry, on the other hand, affects each element and is affected by other elements of the geometry.\n\nAs in your above example, if you don't want the shadow cast on one of the buildings (or ground), but you it to cast shadow over other geometries, you should input is as context.\n\nHope is clear enough.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 1, 2015 at 10:53am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1335006", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1335341"}
