{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI tried several times, radiance works but the component is not able to read the result (failed to read the results). In the green area.\u00a0\n\nIn the same I'm trying to simulate dynamic venetian blinds (connecting the DS parameter), but I obtained strange results in annual glare simulation (highlight in the red area).\u00a0\n\nHow can I effective simulate this type of shading using honeybee? And how can I obtain glare and annual illuminance results with dynamic shading (if I put false in Onlyrunglareanalysis doesn't work).\n\nIn attached you can find rhino and gh file.\n\nThanks\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nAndrea\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1653611", "name": "Energy_Simulation_Daylight.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1653612", "name": "Simulationfile_1.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Andrea Zani", "created_at": "December 7, 2016 at 12:30am", "created_by": "AndreaZani905", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1651802", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1653610"}
