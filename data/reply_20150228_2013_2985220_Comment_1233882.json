{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\nSorry for taking so long to respond. \u00a0Let's post all of the responses here as opposed to the other discussion.\n\nThe issue that you pose here is a difficult one but there are some ways of getting a sense of the conditions on the street by \"hacking\" some of the components. \u00a0The \"Outdoor Solar Adjusted Temperature\" component can give you a sense of the MRT delta that a person would feel as a result of the additional solar radiation being reflected onto them from the building. \u00a0You are going to have to input different radiation values into this component other than the usual weather file values in order to account for the effects of additional reflected solar radiation off of the facade. \u00a0I would start by doing a Honeybee Radiance simulation of the situation in order to get the amount of solar radiation being focused onto that spot. \u00a0You should model the glass facades of the building as mirror materials that have a reflectivity equal to that of the glass. \u00a0This is effectively what I did for a project that was purposefully attempting to focus sunlight onto an indoor thermal mass with a set of reflective parabolic forms and, as you can see, I was able to successfully model the focusing effect:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vfj0TqHwhitQ-UqAL4plYoayYTBtsDhywpZV3G1Q7OtDVPZV64ZokicFga3Ks4jFZAg1CmiHtuDeBEdS-84PglCcKcyiYlQm/SolarFocusing.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vfj0TqHwhitQ-UqAL4plYoayYTBtsDhywpZV3G1Q7OtDVPZV64ZokicFga3Ks4jFZAg1CmiHtuDeBEdS-84PglCcKcyiYlQm/SolarFocusing.PNG)\n\n\n\nOnce you have a sense of the differences in radiation around your spot from the Radiance simulation, you can pick one of the larger amounts of radiation, separate it into an estimated diffuse and direct portion, plug in those values to the solar adjusted temperature component and, from there, you can start to get a sense of the MRT delta that someone would feel sitting in the place where the sunlight is being focused.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the surface temperature of the ground is so dependent upon the conditions of the previous few hours that it is not going to be easy to calculate it. \u00a0The only part of Honeybee that is capable of doing such a temporal calculation is EnergyPlus but, to be honest, I do not trust their solar distribution calculation to accurately model the effects of focusing the sun rays like this. \u00a0In your case, I think that you are just going to have to make an educated guess from the amount of solar radiation falling on the ground in comparison to the temperature of a normal outdoor surface. \u00a0In any case, the MRT delta from the solar radiation falling directly onto people will probably be much higher than the surface temperature delta so I would start with the above method first).\n\n\n\nKeep me posted on how things turn out.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 28, 2015 at 08:13PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1232739", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1233882"}
