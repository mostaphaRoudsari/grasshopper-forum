{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI'm sure this is a very simple question, but why isn't my baked ladybug radiation analysis layer in Rhino rendering? The rest of my model renders, but the heat map produced by the radiation analysis component doesn't appear. The layer is turned on and visible (even when in 'rendered' view mode) but disappears when I actually render an image.\n\n\n\nI've trawled the forums and google but can't seem to find anything.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nWigg\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1782434", "name": "Issue.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "T Wigg", "created_at": "July 11, 2017 at 9:48am", "created_by": "TWigg", "topic": "Ladybug Radiation Analysis layer not rendering?", "id": "topic_1782435"}
