{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nFirst of all I am impressed by your work LB+HB can solve a lot of problem.\n\nI am a new user and I was wondering if it would be possible to export a grid of the indoor solar heat gain on the floor.\n\n\n\nI want to calculate the comfort of the building, but due to 100% ratio of glazing I have to introduce the solar gain to calculate a new mean radiant temperature.\n\nI saw that the component \"Ladybug_Outdoor Solar Adjustor\" calculate it but only on a mannequin, It would be amazing if I can calculate through the whole floor of my building.\n\nIs there a way to do that ?\n\n\n\nThank you all for your help!\n\n\n\nMehdi\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mehdi HAMDANI", "created_at": "March 15, 2017 at 10:23am", "created_by": "MehdiHAMDANI", "topic": "MRT Calculation", "id": "topic_1713094"}
