{"body": "\nHi Anas,\n\nI am sorry I did not look at this earlier. Please find file attached.\n\nFollowing are some observation and summary of changes I made while working on your file.\n\n<br/>1. Those unnecessary points that you pointed to in your post were solved by simplifying the test plane geometry.\n\n2. In solve-adjacency component, internal construction was provided a boolean value. That was removed.<br/>3. HBZones were assigned Radiance materials for Daylight simulation.<br/>4. Since cooling and heated energy was requested in simulation parameter, conditioning was set to true.<br/>5. The names of materials you added to the library and the names of the materials you were assigning were different. That was fixed.\n\n6. This looks more like an office building. Are you sure of apartment schedule? (Just a thought)\n\n7. You should grow your definition in segments. Make, test one segment, then move to the next. Setting up the whole workflow at once is not a good idea unless you're absolutely confident of it.\n\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/llVO6PYtbd7xZVJTA6iMWys0GmGynAe16ONeFLTSWXi5bB7TShient9480chIcmaHkUQHxL7Y8EI1QjXxSSWK9kxHmYmgo3v/Daylight.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/llVO6PYtbd7xZVJTA6iMWys0GmGynAe16ONeFLTSWXi5bB7TShient9480chIcmaHkUQHxL7Y8EI1QjXxSSWK9kxHmYmgo3v/Daylight.JPG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/llVO6PYtbd4TCOmLSxWKIjFwsGD*JiomhPw9GQZJ5NaDDxUCGp3U8g01g*w5Bzo4ei8*Fudc1R9vOQ0DCCZ7QIVxSJOHSVUb/Energy.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/llVO6PYtbd4TCOmLSxWKIjFwsGD*JiomhPw9GQZJ5NaDDxUCGp3U8g01g*w5Bzo4ei8*Fudc1R9vOQ0DCCZ7QIVxSJOHSVUb/Energy.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1674452", "name": "testtrial.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "January 18, 2017 at 9:01am", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "topic_1657139", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1674450"}
