{"body": "\nThank you for your advice, Chris! The updated diagram is shown below.\n\n\n\nMay I confirm with you that, if indoor temperature is within either one of the two 1degree buffer ranges, the thermal zone will be in a **No-NV (windows closed)** and **No-AC (AC off)** status?\n\n\n\n(I think I asked you this in another post) Can I also confirm with you that if we want the AC to switch on for non-NV conditions, we need to specify True for the isConditioned_ option on the Mass2Zone component? Otherwise, the for the hours with non-NV conditions, the windows will be closed and AC will be off?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/RBh5pTSdbmtCKJmne4YNdWX2ao72p49Bu58wFvlNrNcUqDbZhQ36NtsdXQWFZhlQg7YZTDcw8nlyVXbAH0Td438moH0-GLTO/Picture1.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/RBh5pTSdbmtCKJmne4YNdWX2ao72p49Bu58wFvlNrNcUqDbZhQ36NtsdXQWFZhlQg7YZTDcw8nlyVXbAH0Td438moH0-GLTO/Picture1.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "September 19, 2016 at 12:20AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1601500", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1601605"}
