{"body": "\nHello Boris,\n\nthank you for the reply, don't worry, for me took a while to check back here. it is interesting what you say, actually I also developed something similar to what you did (but ok you did a component I just used different components and GH tools to do the same - and this become part of my short paper submission for SimAUD 2016). My solution compares the height of the same points of different solar envelope and then chose the lowest one. I read about the improvement you are working on and it is good but I think it is not yet what I need (or how the solar envelope tool could be more complete).\n\nWhat I need is a solar envelope that would guarantee on different facades with different orientations (the example I sent you) a certain amount of direct sunlight, say 4h per day in a given period for example all the month of June at 60\u00b0N. So to guarantee the south facing facade I should chose the vectors from 10 to 14. But these are not ok for all the other facades because in this timeframe the East and West facing facades get only 2 hours and the North get 0 hours.\u00a0\n\nSo the fist step would be have the possibility to chose different sun vectors for different facades. For the example I did (the 4 hours in June at 60\u00b0N) the south facing facade would need from 10 to 14, the East facing for example from 8 to 12, the West facing facade from 12 to 16 and the North facing facade from 6 to 8 and from 18 to 20.\n\nIf I would chose a single longer time frame that could get all these hours, from 8 to 20 then the resulting solar envelope would result probably smaller than the sum of the four solar envelopes.\n\nBut this is not complete yet. I mean the use of different sun vectors on different facades. The reason is that for example when I chose the sun vectors from 8 to 12 for the four hours on the East facing facade how do I know that the sun hit on the facade in that time frame or maybe it is obstructed by surrounding buildings? Since the sun at\u00a060\u00b0N (where I live) in June rise at around 3.15 then maybe for that specific facade the sun hit from 4 to 8 and not from 8 to 12.\n\nI did an extreme case talking about 60\u00b0N and that maybe the sun hit on a facade at 4 instead than 12, but it is just to make understand the logic. My suggestion for a more advanced solar envelope it should be integrated with the Sunlight Hours tool of ladybug. So the input should not be the sun vectors because I don't know when the sun hit on the facade but the input should be just the desired number of hours and the possibility to specify different number of hours for each facade. Then this last component that sum different solar envelope (I didn't use it yet but I understood what it does) should be integrated yes so the result would be one single solar envelope more likely using the lowest points (the highest I don't understand what for).\n\n\n\nLet me know what you think! \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "November 24, 2015 at 06:28AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1406197", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1407787"}
