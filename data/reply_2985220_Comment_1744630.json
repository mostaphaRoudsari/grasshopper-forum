{"body": "\nMy discussion comment seems to have gotten erased when i posted (leaving only the title), so here it is again.\n\n\n\nI am trying to get the R,G,B channel data from an annual simulation. It seems to only preserve the illuminance results (in the .ill file).\n\n\n\nI am trying to get the R,G,B result on an hourly basis over the year. But there seems to be no .res file generated if the annual daylight simulation recipe is used.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions or ideas for how to get the R,G,B result for each point over all 8760 hours of the year?\n\n\n\nIs this possible with Honeybee components, or even DAYSIM?\n\n\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated !!!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Octagon26", "created_at": "May 2, 2017 at 4:05pm", "created_by": "Octagon26", "parent_id": "topic_1744290", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1744630"}
