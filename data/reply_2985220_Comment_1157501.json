{"body": "\nHi Nancy, Based on what you are saying everything should work fine. Let's try to debug it step by step.\n\nHave you tested the GHPython component itself? I would suggest to start from there and see if the GHPython component runs fine on your system. You can try something simple like print \"hi!\" and then press F5 and see if it works. You can find it under Maths tab.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 28, 2014 at 10:56pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1157158", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1157501"}
