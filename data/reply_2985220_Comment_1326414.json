{"body": "\nHello!\n\n\n\nSorry for being away in this lately. I have a few days off work, I will quickly try a small model tomorrow morning (as it's quite late here) and come back to you tomorrow!\n\n\n\nSounds like amazing news though!\n\n\n\nAs an additional question, are the components still being developed? I remember not all the ASHRAE templates were working.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "July 15, 2015 at 8:53am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1326413", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1326414"}
