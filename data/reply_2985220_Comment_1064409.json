{"body": "\nI have one question about Meshes:\n\n\n\nI have a building with multiple testSurfaces and generate testPoints and Meshes from them.\n\nWhat I want to have in the end is a Color Mesh with analysisResults that I put in manually. Everything works so far - the problem I have is:\n\n\n\nas far as I understood - the _inputMesh in the Ladybug Re-Color Mesh works like this -- it is aways matched to the number of faces in the inputMesh\n\n\n\nSo to get to the point - I have multiple surfaces with for example 2 Mesh faces, so when I input 2 Results it shows on both surfaces and so on. So what I would need is to make the multiple mashes to one. Do you know if and how this is possible?\n\n\n\nI hope I could make it a bit understandable - if not - I could always upload the grasshopper file\n\n\n\nJust as a note - the reason Im doing this is that I want to a real world analysis (Daylight Factor) and then visualize and compare it to a visualization made in Honeybee.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you very much for now\n\n\n\ncheers Tom\n\n\n\nPS: also the thing is - they are not next to each other\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Lechner", "created_at": "May 4, 2014 at 1:07pm", "created_by": "ThomasLechner", "parent_id": "topic_1045033", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1064409"}
