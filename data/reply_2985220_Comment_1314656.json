{"body": "\nMahdi,\n\nBasically your file was \"almost\" fine.\n\nBut:\n\nYou were missing both LB_LB and HB_HB components. Also i updated the file. Your definitions were pretty old. Also the HB_createHBZones the HB_Surfaces input wasn't flattened for some reason.\n\nAnd the last thing after that the zone was recognized as OpenBrep. I change the tolerance in Rhino to 0.001 and reloaded the file. That fixed the issue and te zone is closed now.\n\nSee attached a working version.\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 23, 2015 at 9:06pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1314392", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1314656"}
