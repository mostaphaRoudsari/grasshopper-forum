{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\nI just saw this post - there was a problem with the compiler used by NREL with evalglare in the v5.0a11.<br/><br/>You should have contacted me directly - I always have running and tested versions for evalglare for linux, mac and windows here at epfl internally.\n\nIf you download the new 5.1 Radiance package, this issue should be fixed. Please don't use the older versions of evalglare (versions &lt;1.31) any more. Besides new evaluation features, I included a lot of new safety features as well preventing from wrong usage. And as bonus, evalglare is around 10 faster now.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "September 12, 2017 at 02:20AM", "created_by": "JanWienold", "parent_id": "topic_1611644", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1812326"}
