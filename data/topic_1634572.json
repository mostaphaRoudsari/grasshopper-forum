{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\n\nAnd thanks for all the great work. I'm having the following problem with the HB window shade generator.<br/><br/>Ive been trying to produce shading and discovered that the different versions behave differently - same input given. The concern is that the newer version seems to not produce any HB objects while the old one did. When using version .58 and setting it up as can be seen in the \"first error...\" file below I am able to succesfully produce a HB object. <br/><br/>However: Why am I not able to produce a HB object when using _numofShds? I can only get it to work using _distBetween. Why is this? This is my main question, the following one is a possible bug report.<br/><br/>When using the exact same setup as used in the .58 version that did produce a HB object on the .60 version it will not produce anything at all. And when I have them both in the canvas simultaneously (I realize its a sketchy thing to have two versions of stuff at the same time) the .58 gives me another error about materials input and EPfenSurface, as it turns red. This can be seen in the other file I input submitted.<br/><br/>What should I try?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1634570", "name": "first error EnergyPlus_Window_Shade_Generator.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1634571", "name": "shade generator error.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "November 7, 2016 at 1:10pm", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "topic": "Window shade generator (sometimes) won't output HB object.", "id": "topic_1634572"}
