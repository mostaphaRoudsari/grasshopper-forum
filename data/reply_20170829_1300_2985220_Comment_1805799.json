{"body": "\nHi Christian,\n\nChris already gave the answer to your question. Thank you Chris!!\n\nAs for the mPET: it would require complete understanding of each line of code of the original Hoeppe's PET code, and the understanding of mPET's YCC model and its [implementation](http://www.urbanclimate.net/matzarakis/papers/15_chen.pdf)\u00a0in original PET<br/>I must admit, I am not the right person who can do this.\n\nFor simplified analysis, and if you would like to use mPET for academic/scientific purposes, you can contact Profesor Matzarakis at the email addresses provided on his [university page](http://www.urbanclimate.net/rayman/rayman.htm).<br/>He will send you the newest version of Rayman software for free, which among other Thermal Comfort indices, includes mPET.\n\nSorry if this was not the answer that you were expecting.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "August 29, 2017 at 01:00PM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1805605", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1805799"}
