{"body": "\nDing,\n\nThe COP method is a decent way of estimating your electrical energy and thank you, Abraham, for pointing that out. \u00a0 Just make sure that the fuel types for both your heating and cooling systems are electricity (if you have natural gas for heating, for example, this comparison won't work). \u00a0Also, keep in mind that this method is a rough estimate and that the actual COP of a system can vary depending on how it is operated. \u00a0You should land in the right ballpark with this simple multiplication method, though.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 17, 2015 at 01:13PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280317", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1288819"}
