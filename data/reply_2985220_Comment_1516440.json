{"body": "\nThanks. That shows why it's happening. For some reason you have Python27 as the first item. This should be fixed in GHPython but for now we can move ```import sys``` up as the first import and then sort sys.path by Python27 to make sure it will be moved to the bottom of the list.\n\n\n\nimport sys<br/> sys.path = sorted(sys.path, key=lambda p: p.find(\"Python27\"))\n\n\n\nAttached file has a modified Honeybee_honeybee component. Let me know if the component executes with no issues and we can add this as part of the official release.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1516441", "name": "Honeybee_PythonPath_reversed.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 25, 2016 at 10:20am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1516304", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1516440"}
