{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf we take the Fan in your example, the portion of the geometry that is extending into the BaseSurface from is technically the limits of the solar geometry. Filling in the north would be inaccurate because the Fan is only supposed to generate the minimum 3d boundaries that guarantee solar access.\n\nYou could, for example, build into that gap on the north side, and it would cast no shadow within our BaseSurface.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe same applies to the solar Envelope.\n\nIs this what you meant? Or am I misunderstanding your question?\n\n\n\nI made a sample gh file that shows the solar extrusions that the fan operates by for my component. The fan works by \"filling in\" these extremes together to form the overall 3d boundary. Anything outside those extremes are not in the path of the solar vectors, therefore will not cast a shadow - this includes that portion to the north you've identified.\n\nHope it helps!\n\n\n\n- Saeran\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1003093", "name": "solarFan_solarExtrusions_2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "February 4, 2014 at 8:03pm", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_999235", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1003092"}
