{"body": "\nHi Hui Ling,\n\nYou had an extra Enter after your input for \"lux\". If you remove that FalseColor image will be produced (attached!).\n\n\n\nI cannot re-produce the issue with white image. It is usually a result of high exposure which can be set with setting setExposure to True which I can see that you already did. Can you send me the weather file that you are using?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/6q4t4dNL56kOBcBt66*mXVx-Bd2NJOmW8ddE9iHWf85oKi7QjvzAALhAyXa3HiuWjUXRbeF9618MIom01SBXdsZ4G4Syq*Xh/GlareAndFalseColor.png\" width=\"699\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/6q4t4dNL56kOBcBt66*mXVx-Bd2NJOmW8ddE9iHWf85oKi7QjvzAALhAyXa3HiuWjUXRbeF9618MIom01SBXdsZ4G4Syq*Xh/GlareAndFalseColor.png)\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1149687", "name": "1015_IMGglare_ques_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 16, 2014 at 12:01am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1149674", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1149685"}
