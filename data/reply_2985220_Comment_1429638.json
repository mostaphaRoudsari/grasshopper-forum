{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThis is weird.\n\nFirst of all, i'm not using constructions.\n\nI was just trying the example file as is. The thing is that i see the EP materials out of the HB_callFromEPConstrLibrary, but they are not recognized by the HB_writeTHERM. I changed the materials using my own EP's and it is now working.\n\nAfter your above response i disconnected your materials and connected again and it is working now.\n\nI suppose some times it need some kind of \"electric shock\" to work :-)\n\nIt is fine now.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 2, 2016 at 11:35pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1429394", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1429638"}
