{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI have been going the energy simulation tutorials and I have to say thank you for all the resources you are giving.\n\n\n\nI have a quick question on visualizing results. Is there an option to somehow animate the changes during a whole day, for example of cooling loads or operative temperatures, when visualizing results per zones? Something like a movable step of simulation slider.\n\n\n\nI think it would help both in communicating results as in actually interpreting them.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 31, 2015 at 06:34AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Creating video files out of eplus visualizations", "id": "topic_1214921"}
