{"body": "\nArpan,\n\n\n\nThe current OpenStudio component can take csv schedules and they are being taken into account in the simulation. \u00a0The old OpenStudio component from the last stable release could not do this and would give you that message.\n\n\n\nThe current OpenStudio component will give a printed message when you have CSV schedules in the simulation. \u00a0This message says:\n\n\"The schedule will be written into the EnergyPlus IDF File after it has been written by decompressing the OS file.\"\n\nThis is because the OpenStudio interface currently does not support CSV schedules even though Honeybee does. \u00a0So, if you open your OSM file in OpenStudio and simulate your file within the OpenStudio interface, the CSVs will not be taken into account. \u00a0However, simulating by hitting the runSimulation_ Boolean on the OpenStudio component will make sure they are accounted for.\n\n\n\nIf this does not describe what you are expereincing, please upload a smaller GH file and csv file that shows just the error.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 03, 2016 at 12:18PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1575869", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1576153"}
