{"body": "\nHi thank you for the Ladybug/Honeybee tool it has been a great help for my research! I ran the simulation as mentioned in the videos, I noticed that even if I put hourly in time step, Energyplus \u00a0runs it for every ten minutes, I would like to get the data out as it is, for ten or 15 mins. How or where should I change the parameter?\u00a0\n\nThank you,\n\nVinu\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "March 26, 2015 at 12:03pm", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "topic": "Simulation output in 15 minutes time step", "id": "topic_1250917"}
