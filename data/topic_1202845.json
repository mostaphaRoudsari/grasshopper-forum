{"body": "\nHi\n\n\n\nI have some questions regarding the analysis period in Ladybug. If I enter in the hours from 9-15 with a 4 (15min) time step the last item in the sunPositionInfo output displays 14:45. Does this mean that the 3pm vector isn't being calculated? Is this a bug or is this intended to work this way?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LXZYmTRupZ*THl8v22UWKW7jcO5o6kc2a34EPC7OypjtFe-ROFWgycGsDdOUrPKvCss4KoBlpOL903ol1cZPZ6npIy6tBtan/Ladybugquestion.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/LXZYmTRupZ*THl8v22UWKW7jcO5o6kc2a34EPC7OypjtFe-ROFWgycGsDdOUrPKvCss4KoBlpOL903ol1cZPZ6npIy6tBtan/Ladybugquestion.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul Wintour", "created_at": "January 11, 2015 at 10:40pm", "created_by": "PaulWintour", "topic": "Ladybug analysis period problems", "id": "topic_1202845"}
