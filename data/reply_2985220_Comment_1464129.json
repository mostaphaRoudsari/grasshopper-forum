{"body": "\nHi Federico,\n\n\n\nIf your metallic venetian blinds are specular (instead of being lambertian), then photon mapping will most likely produce more physically realistic results. Greg Ward had presented this image at the last Radiance Workshop ([more details](http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2015-philadelphia/presentations/day1/PhotonMapHSLU2015.pdf)):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Xi0CdRBbqOWRGvH5QsPAjaz*jcfI-wclMVDbNyhPJhjJAsHpva-S8wmPX0Et0r*F9X6H0uuRIj7Pt5Zm-GvycOuhVLnidLy9/Untitled.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Xi0CdRBbqOWRGvH5QsPAjaz*jcfI-wclMVDbNyhPJhjJAsHpva-S8wmPX0Et0r*F9X6H0uuRIj7Pt5Zm-GvycOuhVLnidLy9/Untitled.jpg)The bright patterns on the right image are due to caustics from the edges on the Glass.\n\n\n\nI tried a few simulations to test it on my own. The below two simulations are with classic radiance. You don't see any patterns on the wall due to reflections from the pool.[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Xi0CdRBbqOW-ZDxtUAx48bs8oGH8F80TnAFoEWenVtloAECNkU8anFJ4rcSlXlSRkZZWdC7XM5bjsHVbqtH*amAMTvU-HP2i/house_Close_to_pool.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Xi0CdRBbqOW-ZDxtUAx48bs8oGH8F80TnAFoEWenVtloAECNkU8anFJ4rcSlXlSRkZZWdC7XM5bjsHVbqtH*amAMTvU-HP2i/house_Close_to_pool.jpg)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Xi0CdRBbqOWxFeVFmZ9irDZEbZwKV8BTGMa1ui8SEOSRCGcEqGvfIK1RC0o-Rgksk2l2drey8Q1nF7kckb0cEbS9rXiRSSNg/house_Look_at_pool_perforated.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Xi0CdRBbqOWxFeVFmZ9irDZEbZwKV8BTGMa1ui8SEOSRCGcEqGvfIK1RC0o-Rgksk2l2drey8Q1nF7kckb0cEbS9rXiRSSNg/house_Look_at_pool_perforated.jpg)\n\nWhile the series of images below is with Photon Mapping. You can see the effect of caustics on the areas highlighted by red rectangles.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Xi0CdRBbqOVyAhrf3l8o5mNlFxPC8HZsOFEyEvaqadMHzhRMhDGFdujNWkDiwn1eAhjUea-eCWIC5qHpOUc8BQYryjGS17ug/14437209139080307.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Xi0CdRBbqOVyAhrf3l8o5mNlFxPC8HZsOFEyEvaqadMHzhRMhDGFdujNWkDiwn1eAhjUea-eCWIC5qHpOUc8BQYryjGS17ug/14437209139080307.jpg)\n\nBased on what I have read and tested so far I think you'd probably see some noticable differences with Photon Mapping simulations if your model involves curved specular metallic surfaces.\n\n\n\nThe bare minimum requirement to implement PhotonMaps in Honeybee would be to link the binary file mkpmap to the workflow and then add the flag -ap to rpict to account for global and caustic photons. To put it simply, it's fairly doable.\u00a0 I had tested all my simulations on a Linux system, however, I am told that the photon mapping files work fairly well on windows as well. I would suggest that you create a simulation in Honeybee with standard radiance commands and then share the file. It should be fairly easy to create a hack code to link that to the photon mapping commands.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "February 16, 2016 at 12:15am", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1464032", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1464129"}
