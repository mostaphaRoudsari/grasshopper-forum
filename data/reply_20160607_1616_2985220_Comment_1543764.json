{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nThe case for which you post images seems like it might be best modeled by using the 0-blinds shadeType_ with shdAngle_ of 90. \u00a0Or perhaps I am misunderstanding. \u00a0Is the angle of the shades changing dynamically over time? \u00a0If so, I know that E+ has the ability to set a blind slat angle schedule but I have not implemented it yet on the component. \u00a0If you are just requesting that this angle scheudle feature be added, we can create a github issue and I will implement it while I make blinds on the OpenStudio component (this will happen before the next stable release).\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 07, 2016 at 04:16PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1543011", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1543764"}
