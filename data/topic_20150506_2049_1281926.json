{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am interested saving a bunch of views for rendering and then process them through a custom batch file.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to capture viewport coordinates and view direction from Rhino viewport in Honeybee ? I know that it is possible to create renderings through Honeybee_Run daylight simulation. Is there a way to bypass the whole rendering process and only extract the view files instead ?\n\n\n\nTypical configuration of a view file looks like this (vp and vd correspond to viewpoint and view-direction respectively):\n\nrvu -vtv **-vp** -5.412320 -343.990701 15.513205 **-vd** 0.205170 0.978726 0.000000 -vu 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 -vv 35.0 -vh 69.1823210963438 -vo 0.0 -va 0.0\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 06, 2015 at 08:49PM", "created_by": "sarith", "topic": "Radiance view file from Rhino Viewport", "id": "topic_1281926"}
