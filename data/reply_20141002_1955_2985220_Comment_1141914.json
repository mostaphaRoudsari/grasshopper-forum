{"body": "\nThanks for reporting Ben. It should be an easy fix then. I added the issue to github and we will get it fixed soon. Meanwhile you can use the Ladybug component with no version check.\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/185](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/185)\n\nI can't see Chris's comment here but based on what I have in my email, the component won't download the files every time. This is a version check and happens every time so it will notify the user if a newer version is available. I can add a time-out so if the connection is blocked it just passes the test.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 02, 2014 at 07:55PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1142010", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1141914"}
