You need to offset the edges of your window inside the parent surface if you want to use addHBGlz component.\n\nThe other approach is to split the surface in Rhino and assign the materials surface by surface.\n\nCheck the attached Rhino file.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1529289", "name": "GridBasedDaylightSimulationTest_msr.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 12, 2016 at 7:13pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1529520", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1529287"}
