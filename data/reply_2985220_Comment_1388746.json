{"body": "\nI don't mean to highjack this discussion, however, I got inspired by/copied Chris's solution and wrote a Python script to replace much of the grasshopper components as I need something similar for my own research. An example is here... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6foolvaKhNE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6foolvaKhNE). But I cannot get the extrude-along-vector to work inside Python. The extrusion created by python script always seems to get warped for some reason. Is there anything that I can do to fix this ? My ghuser file is attached.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1388748", "name": "Add_window_thickness.ghuser"}], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "October 28, 2015 at 6:26pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1373939", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1388746"}
