{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nFirst time user of Rhino, of Grasshopper, Ladybug, and Honeybee. It's a lot to swallow but so far I love (or I would love it if I didn't have a crazy deadline :)).\n\n\n\nI'm pretty sure this is because of my own doing, but I'm getting an error when trying to solve adjacencies, and I'm getting a warning beforehand when intersecting masses.\n\n\n\nThe warning when intersecting masses is that Honeybee cannot check normal direction for some zones. I looked through the forum, and as I understand this is usually due to surfaces that have their normal direction pointing the wrong way. But I checked and as far as I can tell they are pointing outwards.\n\n\n\nThe error I'm getting when solving adjacencies is:\n\n\"Runtime error (MissingMemberException): 'EPZone' object has no attribute 'cenPt'<br/>Traceback:<br/>\u00a0 line 196, in main, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/>\u00a0 line 247, in script<br/>\"\n\n\n\nCould someone help me figure out what's wrong please?\n\n\n\nAttached is the grasshopper where I have internalized the data.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1245044", "name": "Test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Julien Marrec", "created_at": "March 18, 2015 at 10:01am", "created_by": "JulienMarrec", "topic": "EPZone has no attribute CenPt", "id": "topic_1245045"}
