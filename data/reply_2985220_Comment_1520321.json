{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThanks for your clarification!\n\nActually I am using one room+ single window\u00a0in HB for my parametric study which will help architects make design decision at\u00a0initial design stage. Am I right to\u00a0say, based on your reply,\u00a0that it is still possible to follow IES LEM-83-12 to\u00a0estimate\u00a0sDA in HB? It would be great if you are able to show me any example or workaround.\n\n\n\nFor LEED v4 calculation, currently I am using Diva4Rhino. But I\u00a0am very interested in the HB/OpenStudio workflow and expect to compare sDA/ASE results generated by different\u00a0workflows. According to my current understanding, it is very difficult\u00a0to achieve LEED v4 daylight points under option 1. \u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks again for your prompt reply.\n\n\n\nRegards, Cheney\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Cheney", "created_at": "May 1, 2016 at 11:18am", "created_by": "Cheney", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519604", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1520321"}
