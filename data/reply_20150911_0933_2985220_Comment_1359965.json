{"body": "\nThank you very much Mostapha,<br/>actually we think that only if we can fully customize the internal gain part we will be able to use honeybee and ladybug to perform professional and research simulation at ease (even in Europe where we have different regulation for example regarding the comfort where the ASHRAE standard is replaced by CEN).\n\nIt would be great if honeybee could allow us to do one of the two following options:\n\n<br/>1) insert our personal internal gains strings through the additional strings command, with an ovverride on the in-built internal gains of the \"runEnergySimulation\" command;<br/>2) create a specific command for internal gains (as you have already done for other commands) where various strings can be added to the energy plus file along with their schedules.\n\nthis way it would be possible to use the software to model a specific occupancy situation with its internal gains.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Filippo", "created_at": "September 11, 2015 at 09:33AM", "created_by": "Filippo", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1343873", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1359965"}
