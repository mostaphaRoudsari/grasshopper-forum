{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI'm really happy to see the natural ventilation component in the latest release of Honeybee. \u00a0I am curious about how it works and the best way to model a mixed mode system. \u00a0Is there a way to simulate open windows when the outdoor temperature is in the comfort range and couple that with supplemental mechanical conditioning (with closed windows) when the exterior temperature is outside of that range?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nGeoffrey\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Geoffrey Becker", "created_at": "February 16, 2015 at 4:03pm", "created_by": "GeoffreyBecker", "topic": "Natural and Mixed Mode Ventilation", "id": "topic_1225855"}
