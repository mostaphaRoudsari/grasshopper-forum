{"body": "\nHello Devang,\n\nthank you for your reply. Actually is not that the problem. I am not using the legend to read the number of direct sun light hours on each building.\n\nI explain a bit more what I am doing. What I need to know is the minimum number of direct sun light hours per day (during the specified period) per test-point/facade/building. so I made a small algorithm to check if each test-point get more or less of a specific amount of direct sun light hours per day in the specified period.\u00a0\n\nI want to test one building alone surrounded by different buildings (context) in different configurations and orientations. So when I say that I have two (ore more) buildings surrounded by other buildings I mean I have different configurations of the same building that I want to test with just one single run of the\u00a0Ladybug_Sunlight Hours Analysis component so to have the work done more quickly.\u00a0\n\nSo the problem is just that if I test each building configuration (in the geometry input) each time I get a result if I use multiple buildings (in the geometry input)\u00a0I have another result. But that should not be. And I am sure in previous versions of Ladybug different geometries were not shadowing each-other until you input them also in the context input.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "January 11, 2017 at 2:46am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1669735", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1669948"}
