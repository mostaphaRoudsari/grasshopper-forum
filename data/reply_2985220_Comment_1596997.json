{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nAccording to your explanation, the thermal zone connected to the ****Honeybee Set EP Air Flow**** component will have natural ventilation only for hours when both the indoor and outdoor air temperature are within their respective min-max range as specified.\n\n\n\nFor the hours that don't fit this criteria, can this thermal zone use an **Ideal Loads Air System** to cool down or heat up the space? If it can, shall this zone be specified as **True** for **isConditioned_** on the **mass2zone** component?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "September 11, 2016 at 4:26am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1596947", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1596997"}
