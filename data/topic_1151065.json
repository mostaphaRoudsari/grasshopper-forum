{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI have a kind of question or bug report. Probably the first.\n\nI'm trying to \"control\" the zone program for each of them. I'm using the HB_ListZonePrograms component and connecting it to the HB_Mass2Zone. I'm choosing MidRiseApartment from the BldgPorograms.\n\nSo the first question is how to assign a precise program for each zone? I assume the Mass2Zone makes some random assignment ...\n\nIn the attached picturre i tried to pick from the list and make all of the zones \"Apartments\". It is not working.\n\nMoreover, if you look at the right side of the picturre it asigned an OpenOffice use, which is not part of the list at all (is this a bug?).\n\nI'm kind of confuse what is the \"proper\" workflow on this matter.\n\nHow to set the program more precisely per/zone at the beginning or change it in the middle of the work.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1151064", "name": "Capture.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 18, 2014 at 7:37am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "Building program workflow", "id": "topic_1151065"}
