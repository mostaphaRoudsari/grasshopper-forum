{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI have been working with LB+HB for the last two weeks and I am very impressed of what I can already achieve with limited experience.\n\n\n\nI wanted to ask a question concerning masses, zones and surfaces.\n\n\n\nIn the tutorials, the regular flow described is from mass to zone to surface. This is very helpful in simple designs or where a lot of design options are still in our hands.\n\nI was wondering if there is a quick way to extract information from cases where the design is provided as a big 3d file (e.g. sketch up, rhino).\n\n\n\nAt this point I am mostly interesting in an (automated?) way to extract infromation of the facade materials (e.g. WWR in each orientation) and to quickly also assign information to them (e.g. SHGC, SRI, etc.). Can I assign properties to layers or groups of the drawing?\n\n\n\nSorry if this doesn't make much sense, such a novice in 3d design.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 4, 2015 at 9:37pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Extracting geometry details", "id": "topic_1217630"}
