{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\u00a0\n\nThank you for the reply. I have now updated each component piece by piece with better success. However, following the Shading Benefit example on hydra with updated components to v0.59 freezes my Grasshopper. Running the EnergyPlus simulation is fine but when doing the shading benefit part the program freezes. Might there be something holding up the simulation?\u00a0\n\nJustin\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Justin Shultz", "created_at": "March 29, 2016 at 1:33pm", "created_by": "JustinShultz", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1495932", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1495777"}
