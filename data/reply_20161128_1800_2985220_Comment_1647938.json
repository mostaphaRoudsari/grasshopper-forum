{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\n\n\nI am using the same feature for a single zone analysis and I am assigning adiabatic to all my walls except for one. I see an error which says that I need a newer version of HB to use this component. I recently downloaded HB and I am wondering if this error is due to something else.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your help in advance.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLadan\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1647940", "name": "HB-Adiabatic Error.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1647941", "name": "7-SingleZoneIntegratedDLandEnergy_WithMat_Sched_Adiabatic.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 28, 2016 at 06:00PM", "created_by": "LillyGD", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1154999", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647938"}
