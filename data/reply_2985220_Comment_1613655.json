{"body": "\nThanks. I am eager to hear what will happen.<br/><br/>Sorry if I wasn't of much help to you.<br/><br/>In the end, if you are forced to use your PC and not laptop, you can always use the \"Terrain Generator\" component instead of \"Terrain Generator 2\" component. It will extract the elevation data from Google earth instead of Opentopography. The elevation data is different though, as they use different [sources](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/xn/detail/2985220:Comment:1588204).<br/><br/>By the way: I am already in love with the Karya project!!! It seems like a very interesting topic, and a perfect example of how environmental and computational aspects of design should be merged!<br/>I will definitely check the blog to read the new information about it, once in a while\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "October 7, 2016 at 1:31pm", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1613541", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1613655"}
