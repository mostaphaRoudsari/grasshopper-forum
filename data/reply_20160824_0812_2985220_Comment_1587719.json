{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nThanks for testing man! Also, much appreciated for fixing that vector thing, I thing I wasn't actually testing that part of the definition and forgot to check.\n\nAnd yes you are right 0 means South wind for BF since as in all Ladybug tools Y is North. I believe that's why I left it simply as a number in the UI window.\n\n\n\nI should also add that the little crude way of creating a location in mesh that is inside the wind tunnel but outside the building (as it should) is not really working properly for multiple geometry inputs.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "August 24, 2016 at 08:12AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1587583", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1587719"}
