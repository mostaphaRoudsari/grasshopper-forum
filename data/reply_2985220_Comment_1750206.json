{"body": "\nHi Christoffer,\n\n\n\nI opened your Rhino file and there are two issues:\n\n\n\n1. The units are in mm which doesn't seem to be right. The heights of the buildings are 12 units.\n\n2. The model if way far from the origin (0, 0, 0).\n\n\n\nFix the scale and move the model closer to the origin and that should help you to solve the problem.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 12, 2017 at 8:57am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749571", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1750206"}
