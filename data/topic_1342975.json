{"body": "\nI am learning the psychometric chart component in ladybug. When I the \"wind speed\" output from the EPW file and input it into the \"annualhourlydata\" input on the psychometric chart component I am getting an error. When I graft that input the graph appears, but the component still has an error.\n\n\n\nAlso, the passive strategy list component had been functioning properly for me, but now it is causing errors with the psych chart component as well. I've tried loading new components and reconnecting, but the issue still persistants. Any direction would be appreciated.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nRauland\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1342974", "name": "environmental_psychrometric.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Rauland Schaat", "created_at": "August 13, 2015 at 3:33pm", "created_by": "RaulandSchaat", "topic": "psych chart error", "id": "topic_1342975"}
