{"body": "\nMohammed,\n\nHoneybee does not currently have components to create thermally active surfaces or radiant panels. \u00a0If you want to have these in your Honeybee model right now, you are going to have to enter the IDF text lines manually through the new \"additionalStrings_\" input of the Run Simulation component (you must sync with the github to get the Run Simulation component with this input). \u00a0I know that components for radiant panels are on the to-do list but, for now, you are going to have to do it yourself.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 31, 2015 at 7:12pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1250109", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1253860"}
