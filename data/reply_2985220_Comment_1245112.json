{"body": "\nHi Julien,\n\n\n\nI checked your file.\u00a0Quite a big project for the first try!\n\n\n\nMy first suggestion for you is to intersect the geometries in Rhino and then bring them to Grasshopper. So many things can go wrong in intersection process and it doesn't look like you are going to change the relationship between the geometries once they are built (or are you?) By intersecting the geometries in Rhino and save yourself good amount of time.\n\n\n\nThe issue is happening because some of your zones has volumes that cenPt falls outside of the zone. In solveAdjc the component uses cenPts to make sure zones are not duplicated and since there is no cenPt it fails. It was a bug. I added an extra check and it should work fine.\n\n\n\nWelcome!\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1245114", "name": "Test_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 18, 2015 at 10:36am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1245045", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1245112"}
