{"body": "\nI'm about to present some data from my energy model and need to know if there are additional processes I need to perform similar to the COP calculations.\n\n\n\nI have been wondering if my total heat load is accounting for internal gains through lighting, people, and equipment. Is this accounted for or do I need to subtract these units?\n\n\n\nI also assume that my total heating and cooling is accounting for solar gain. I have tested this and believe it is.\n\n\n\nAnything else I'm missing to get good numbers out?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "daviduburke", "created_at": "August 05, 2017 at 07:27AM", "created_by": "daviduburke", "topic": "Processing Energy Plus outputs.
