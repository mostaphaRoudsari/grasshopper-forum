{"body": "\nThanks for the clarification. I will make due with context surfaces then. They are actually meant to be PVs and while reading through the E+ documentation of the heat transfer integration modes of the PV-modules I realize that using PVs might take me a little step closer to thermal integration of the overhang geometry in the zone calculation. However it does say in the input/output reference that \"The input fields for Module Heat Capacity and Module Heat Loss Coefficient are ignored\"\u00a0[L](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-5/input-output-reference/group-electric-load-center-generator.html#photovoltaic-generators)ink\u00a0in the integrated modes, so in the end it doesnt make me much wiser how they are calculated. Looking in the Engineering reference it says that \"If the user specifies \u201c**Integrated Surface Outside Face**\u201d for this parameter, then the temperature result from EnergyPlus\u2019s modeling of surfaces is used for the cell temperature.\"\u00a0[\"Link](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/engineering-reference/photovoltaic-arrays.html#photovoltaic-arrays)\"<br/><br/>Does anyone know how they are calculated? As in if the PV-surfaces also affect the surface temperatures of other surfaces nearby, or if only the surfaces nearby affect the PV-temperature.<br/>\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "November 30, 2016 at 5:13pm", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647105", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1649472"}
