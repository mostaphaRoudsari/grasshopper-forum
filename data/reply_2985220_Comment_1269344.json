{"body": "\nHi Rania,\n\nSome issues in your file. See attached a working one. I internalized the geometry for my convenience.\n\nThe inputs for the LB_bounceFromSurface must be integer numbers. The Panel input doesn't recognize them as such.\n\nBesides that you have an issue using Surface components instead of Brep/Mesh. See red groups.\n\nThe last one: the time periods were defined wrong. Fixed. In the file i choose only one hour, so it runs fast.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1269346", "name": "High_Ref_Glazing_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 22, 2015 at 12:44am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1269285", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1269344"}
