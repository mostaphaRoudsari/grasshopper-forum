{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nI found the issue. \u00a0The names for your zones contained colons (:) within them and this is the same character that EnergyPlus CSV outputs use to separate the zone name from the name of the output. \u00a0So you can imagine that this messes with the result parser and this is why you got the odd result out of the Read EP Surface Result. \u00a0The attached file works correctly (once you change the colon to some other character).\n\nI think that I'll add an extra check within Honeybee_Honeybee to catch all of these possible characters that can mess with the workflow.\n\nI'll post back soon,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1798488", "name": "9.8.17_AY_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 14, 2017 at 07:58PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1798308", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1798487"}
