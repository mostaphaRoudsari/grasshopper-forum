{"body": "\nThis is great!\n\nThank you very much for applying the new features in such short notice.\n\nI believe I would need the .ghuser file formats for the two components\u00a0 (Honeybee_falsecolor and Honeybee_Convert IMG) as I encountered the same discrepancy error between the new ones and the previous versions. Once I replace the previous versions of the component inside the Userobject folder with the latest ones, I would be able to easily load them into my project via the Honeybee tool bar with no error messages.\n\n\n\nThank you indeed,\n\nAlireza\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alireza", "created_at": "April 13, 2014 at 05:42PM", "created_by": "Alireza", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1043505", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1043659"}
