{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for the reply!\n\n\n\nI understand the complexity including costs to inputs and outputs but could be a very exciting future extension of LB/HB.\n\nTo further the conversation on such a potential component/s I attach some images and a GH of a (obviously very very ambitious) dummy component with potential inputs and outputs.\n\nEconomic related inputs could be plugged in manually, corresponding to project specific needs, contractual agreements, locality specifics etc etc.\n\n\n\nOf course what I am proposing could be completely unrealistic...\n\n\n\nThanks a lot once again!\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1224164", "name": "PV_Test_01.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1224167", "name": "Photovoltaics_01.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1224168", "name": "PV_Test_02.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "February 13, 2015 at 10:15am", "created_by": "doompop", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223656", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1224163"}
