{"body": "\nHi Mostapha.\n\nLoading results works fine.\n\nI disconnected the panel from the simpleFoam and now the slowness is fine.\n\nA couple of questions more:\n\nI get results for each 100 iterations. Can i see them?\n\nI don't succeed to see the mesh. I follow the instructions on the Getting Started page but in each try the mesh and pts outputs are null for the loadMesh/Pts components.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 23, 2016 at 11:29pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1587416", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1587544"}
