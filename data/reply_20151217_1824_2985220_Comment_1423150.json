{"body": "Claudia,\nI am not sure if I am understanding your issue well but it looks like some of your windows are not perfectly coplanar with the wall surface. Generating your window surfaces by copying and using scale1D on the wall surface will help ensure that your geometry is correct. An easy way to check if surfaces are coplanar is by selecting both the wall and window and using the \"intersect\" command. If they are coplanar, you should see the window outlined with a curve.\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 17, 2015 at 06:24PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1423049", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1423150"}
