{"body": "\nHi,\n\nFollowing this [thread](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/invalid-heating-cooling-setpoint-temperature-schedule-name) i\"m having \"serious\" issues that i want to consult with you.\n\nI adapted the attached file (from Chris) to be a residential use, that will have 24 hrs use.\n\nI defined schedules for heating and cooling, where the temperatures will be 20 and 24 respectively. The loads change a bit during the day, and also defined the proper schedules for that.\n\nI defined \"hardcore\" that winter period will be from November to March.\n\n\n\nAll this under the warning \"I think i did that\". Since i'm not getting any heating consumption and when i check the temperatures i get crazy values for the winter period (see plotted charts in the attached file).\n\nSummer values are somehow reasonable (at least temperature wise).\n\n\n\nThe definitions that HB uses are a bit different than those i'm used to do, so i suppose there is something i'm doing wrong.\n\n\n\nYour comments will be much appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1211053", "name": "HB_shoeboxing_CWM_AY_Resid.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 25, 2015 at 2:55am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "Heating/Cooling schedules ... high temperatures for winter time", "id": "topic_1211054"}
