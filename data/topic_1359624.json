{"body": "\nI'm attempting to run an annual daylight simulation in honeybee and the run daylight simulation component is producing the following error \"runtime error 'nonetype' object is unsubscriptable\". Anyone know what may be causing this? I've attached an image of the component with the error, and here is a link to the GH file (too large to upload).
