{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha,\n\nThanks for your reply. the model I tried to run is the gh file in attachments. In fact, the problem had been solved after I rebuilt my gh file, although I don't know why. For the older gh file, after 50 or 60 iterations it would crash.\n\nright now, I'm facing a new problem. I tried to optimize the maximum value of the wind speed ratio(WSR) in construction area\u00a0with Galapagos. however, It seems that Galapagos\u00a0can't wait to finish all the steps of calculation. In most situations, an individual generated by Galapagos can be calculated its mesh, but its mesh won't get though the simulation process. Galapagos won't wait to simulate but carry on with wrong data even if the WSR output will be \"Null\".\u00a0\n\nI wonder that if you were caught in this kind of trouble? Could you give me some advice on this problem? Thank you very much.\n\nYi\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1814117", "name": "teaching0915.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Yi LUO", "created_at": "September 15, 2017 at 10:20PM", "created_by": "YiLUO", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1813951", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1814115"}
