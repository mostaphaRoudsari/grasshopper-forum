{"body": "\nHi Antonello,\u00a0\n\nThanks for your reply.\u00a0\n\nYes, it wouod be great to see a schedule which can respect your sunrise/sunset calc with time adjustment filter. Eventually it can be directed into sun path calculation and exclude those sun vectors near sunrise/sunset.\u00a0\n\nI am currently using a walkaround by modifying epw weather file to filter out sun vectors and notice I can get the results I expected. So it is doable. You guys are awsome at writing the code and I really enjoy the way of communication in this forum which sharpens LB HB a more powerful tool!\u00a0\n\nRegards, Cheney\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Cheney", "created_at": "April 30, 2016 at 09:29AM", "created_by": "Cheney", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519330", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519545"}
