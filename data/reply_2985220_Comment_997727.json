{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nI am happy to report that the issue with the Solar Envelope has been solved and it now outputs a reliable result. \u00a0The new component has been uploaded to the github and you should feel free to try it out. \u00a0I ensured that it works on all of the curves in your original file as well as some more.\n\nThanks for the awesome work-around that made this fix possible goes to Guilio, the author of GHPython. \u00a0Guilio's code was also used to pimp-up the solarFan such that it always outputs a single brep.\n\n\n\nEnjoy experimenting with solar geometry!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 27, 2014 at 9:13pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_997146", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_997727"}
