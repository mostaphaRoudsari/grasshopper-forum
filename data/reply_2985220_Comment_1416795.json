{"body": "\nFurion,\n\nThank you for your post. \u00a0Can you upload an example file that demonstrates the crashing so that I can try to re-create the problem on my system? \u00a0Once I can do that, I can figure out how to fix it. \u00a0I have come to realize that the crashing of the psych chart in SR5 was due to the \"while\" loop in the PMV function and I have a sense that this error that you are reporting is related.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 7, 2015 at 8:15pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416216", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416795"}
