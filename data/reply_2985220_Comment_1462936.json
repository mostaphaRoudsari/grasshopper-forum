{"body": "\nThank you very much, Mostapha, for the updated components!\n\n\n\nI did a quick test and it seems that the default zone program set for the thermal zones can be \"packed\" and exported as the .HB file, and it can be loaded back to generate IDF file which contains the schedule, materials and constructions for the default zone program, and the E+ simulation went well with no error.\n\n\n\nDo you mean there might be error when using self-customized materials, constructions, schedules for the zones during the export and load process using these two components?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 9:03am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "topic_1455604", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462936"}
