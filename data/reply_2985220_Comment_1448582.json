{"body": "\nThanks, Abraham!\n\n\n\nThe main difference I see is the difference in sign of the values, i.e. negative value indicate a cool feeling and positive value indicates a warm feeling, which is quite different conceptually in thermal comfort study...\n\n\n\nThe value \"-0.141\" is about 42% \"smaller\" than \"-0.0988\", so the value difference between them is not small...\n\n\n\nIf we have different results, such as -0.55 and 0.49, for the same inputs, how do we determine if it is within the neutral zone? and if such instance accumulate in large scale survey, the conclusions will be problematic.\n\n\n\nBottom line: if the same algorithm is applied for the code of the methods mentioned above, why the results are not that \"similar\" in terms of absolute value and the sign of the value?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "January 28, 2016 at 2:05am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448866", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448582"}
