{"body": "\nThanks Abraham! The issue was with the exporter. Let's try once more.\n\nYou'll still get an error since the component doesn't package schedules and construction/materials which we can add later but if the materials are loaded into library then it should work fine.\n\nOnce we have that in place, this will open up new opportunities. For instance you can break down the process and have a definition on a different machine waiting for the file to run the calculations while you're working on your model locally. #collaboration #cloud #rain\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1462704", "name": "dumpObjects_002.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 8:36am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462912", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462703"}
