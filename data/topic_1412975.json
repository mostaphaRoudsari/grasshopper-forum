{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\n\n\nI want to open a discussion about multiple parameters that have influence in natural ventilation and how i could make a sensitive study of how these parameters work in honeybee/energyplus.I gonnna explore the option 1 (window natural ventilation) of the natural ventilation component. The following questions are:\n\n\n\n- Sensitivity of terrain category. The terrain category affects the wind caracteristics and by that the performance of the natural ventilation. The way to implement the terrain type is by using the component HONEYBEE ENERGY SIMULATION PAR. In my investigation, my goal is to prove that the annual performance will decrease with the roughness of the terrain.\u00a0\n\n\n\n- Location of opening. How does the location of the opening affect the annual performance?\u00a0\u00a0I want to investigate how differs the energy consumption of a room at different building height. How can i do it? I have try just placing a room at 30 m but i guess i have to add a ground level as a reference.\n\n\n\n- Neighbour buildings. How does neighbor buildings affects the annual performance?\n\n\n\n- Shape of the building. How does shape affect the annual performance?\n\n\n\nI hope that these questions can open a discussion.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nEduardo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Eduardo Artigas", "created_at": "December 1, 2015 at 10:03am", "created_by": "EduardoArtigas", "topic": "Natural ventilation basics", "id": "topic_1412975"}
