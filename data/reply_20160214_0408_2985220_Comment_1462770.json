{"body": "\nTheodoros,\n\nThis is an interesting one.\n\nFirst of all, without knowing how is the weather in Singapore, i don't agree and like annual averages for wind considerations. Yo can't bring together winter and summer (for instance) into the same calculation for the average. You should know, at least, what is going on in winter, summer, or any other period of time.\n\nSecond, you are right about your fears of the reliability of the weather files. But, unless you have a local station, there is not much you can do about this. Unfortunately this is a big constrain and limitation. The best is to have the station at your plot. Any other data you have will be an approximation to your site.\n\nThird, this is a wish for the wind analysis components. I wish to get the main first and second directions and their average velocities (in just 2 numbers and directions).\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 04:08AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1462753", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462770"}
