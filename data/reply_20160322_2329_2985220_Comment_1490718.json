{"body": "\nThanks Chris.\n\nYes\u00a0 i saw the 1.2 at the CBE and that's why i reported.\n\n\n\nI'm thinking about your question regarding min/max wind speed. On one side, as you said, it speeds the calculation time significantly. On the other it will be interesting to calculate how many points felt in the extra comfort area but don't have the wind speed to really be in comfort. Dilemma!!\n\nBut if the options are a crashing component/exaggerated calculation time, i'm for this min/max wind assumption. If it is only running time, maybe a flag input saying \"Take all wind speeds\" or \"Take min/max values\" can be fine. But if crashing is a real situation ... then simplify.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 22, 2016 at 11:29PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490568", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490718"}
