{"body": "\nIf you are running Radiance on Unix or OS even multiple ill files aren't required as most (if not all) of the ray-tracing components within Radiance support parallel processes.\n\nTo answer your question about concurrency, batch files can be run concurrently and it issomething that Mostapha has\u00a0already implemented in Honeybee. The primary dependencies for running Radiance are just it's binary and library files which can either be loaded into any environment using PATH and (custom) RAYPATH variables respectively. In the highly unlikely scenario that the user cannot set their environment variables (or set their .bashrc or .profile file in Unix), it is also possible to hardcode the pathnames ..something like /home/user/radiance/bin/oconv geometry.rad &gt; geo.oct etc.\n\n\n\nHaving run Radiance on Unix (workstations and remote clusters/cloud) and Windows systems for the past 3-4 years, the biggest issue to me is that of portability between different operating system environments.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 11, 2016 at 08:09PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1527996", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1528382"}
