{"body": "\nAfternoon\n\n\n\nI am a little confused with the results I am receiving. I have a model with a double skin facade. I have modeled an external glaze line and then 2 internal glaze lines that are adjacent. I have solved adjacencies on these two zones however when I look at the results for the surface indoor temps I find that I have two indoor windows with different surface values. It doesn't look like the adjacencies are solving. Can anybody else take a look and see if I have missed something obvious? Thanks\n\n<br/>Files attached.\n\n<br/>Thanks\n\n\n\nDuncan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1399698", "name": "151113_DSF.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1399699", "name": "151113_DSF.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "November 13, 2015 at 9:16am", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "topic": "Solve Adjacencies and Glazing", "id": "topic_1399700"}
