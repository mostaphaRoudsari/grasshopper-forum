{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\n\n\nThere are couple of minor issues in your file which cause the model not to run correctly.\n\n\n\n1. You don't need to use Add glazing to add glazings when you use glazingBasedOnRatio. It has been already added to the surface.\n\n2. You are applying glazing materials with 0 transmittance to the glasses and that's what makes DF results 0. If you don't know properties of the glass just leave it as it is and Honeybee uses the default values. Are you willing to change the glass properties?\n\n\n\n2-1. Name the materials so they don't overwrite each other as \"noName\".\n\n\n\nCheck the attached file.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/t08dki1KeXzGlIvFXzwruZ1Z2CKbyDsiFHG2PAxtgipwWbjNxJNjnYNSPeEK8T7QYVmOc76*dBSBLrFXX7mGRZ6PiOg2H20D/addGlz.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/t08dki1KeXzGlIvFXzwruZ1Z2CKbyDsiFHG2PAxtgipwWbjNxJNjnYNSPeEK8T7QYVmOc76*dBSBLrFXX7mGRZ6PiOg2H20D/addGlz.png)\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1062754", "name": "1404_CampusOutremont_DF_Anlysis_MSR.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 30, 2014 at 8:32pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1062529", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1062752"}
