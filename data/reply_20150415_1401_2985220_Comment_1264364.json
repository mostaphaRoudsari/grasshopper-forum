{"body": "\nAs for **Octopus**,\n\n\n\nMaybe the image is confusing because it has two options.Last time I asked about it you said that a simple version to start would be to change window size(glazing percentage) according to heating and cooling as objective.\n\nNow this one must be very simple too, if I connect only two objectives.. but Im wondering:\n\n\n\n- - - I should put the geometries as **sliders**(connected to the HBglazign component)\u00a0or in the **genepole** (and connect them with\u00a0**G**)?\n\n- - - In this case should they be areas in GH or breps with assigned geometry?\n\n\n\n- - - for **Objectives**(or fitness)\u00a0, I understand that I have to 'translate' any results I have into numbers?or these are variable too?\n\n\n\nHope I didn't confuse you even more.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nNita\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nit\u00eb", "created_at": "April 15, 2015 at 02:01PM", "created_by": "Nita", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1264522", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1264364"}
