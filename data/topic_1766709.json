{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\n\n\nAfter that Chris solved my problem with the glazing system, I made a step forward. I started to set up the materials of the opaque parts, A, of the facade system.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/aRMdvpURD3mKD*Xz03UYNaMPiOKmbFZB-2ZKEe-i3ZQLxnvm6SEP04YE5qR9hvNrHCyHpUDP6hEj7lsuUNKyeYWo-nZLDR7J/BuildingEnvelope_concept.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/aRMdvpURD3mKD*Xz03UYNaMPiOKmbFZB-2ZKEe-i3ZQLxnvm6SEP04YE5qR9hvNrHCyHpUDP6hEj7lsuUNKyeYWo-nZLDR7J/BuildingEnvelope_concept.JPG)\n\nThe opaque system is made of two layers:\n\n- PCM material;\n\n- Metal panel.\n\n\n\nI used a part of script that I found in the discussion forum to create a PCM material and add the additional strings required in the Energy Plus simulation.\n\nCan anyone tell me if all it's right?\n\n\n\nThanks to all you guys.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1766708", "name": "test room_energy analysis_GOOD_1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Angelo Figliola", "created_at": "June 9, 2017 at 8:45am", "created_by": "AngeloFigliola", "topic": "TEST ROOM_ENERGY ANALYSIS SET UP_PCM setting + Metal materials", "id": "topic_1766709"}
