{"body": "\nHi,\n\nThis discussion starts from an issue i posted asking for the inclusion of E+'s lightshelf object.\n\nMostapha's answer to this wish request was:\n\nI'm kind of skeptical about using any of EnergyPlus objects which are related to (day)lighting, why don't you use Daysim for that and then integrate the results to EP?\n\nI get curious from this response:\n\nYes. My intention was to integrate this into the E+ simulation. I'm aware about the limitations of the daylighting implementation in E+.<br/> But with your suggestion i'm more intrigued about integrating Daysim with E+. I have no experience or clue on how to do this, so any pointers will be appreciated. Maybe this issue can become a discussion for all users, for good practice.<br/> My doubts about this integration relate to the light loads for the simulation in E+, but maybe this is becouse of my ignorance on the integration you recommend.\n\nI understand from Mostapha's answer that:\n\nHoneybee already supports the process. You can do it by running daylight analysis by daysim and then use the annual profile as lighting schedule. If you check the issues on github there should be an issue posted by Trygve.\n\nand\n\nAlso once we get 3-5 phase methods implemented the same workflow will work and will be just so powerful.\n\nSo, i suppose we can expect some updates on this one soon ...\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 30, 2014 at 10:43pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "Lightshelves in simulation", "id": "topic_1178818"}
