{"body": "\nHi Jacob,\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf I'm understanding the question correctly, what you're looking for isn't accommodated by the tool. The solar envelope/fan does not change based on the 3D geometries of adjacent buildings. It only provides the maximum built volume for a given ground geometry. It's one of the limitations of the tool. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nI think what you're looking for is something closer to an iso solar surface[1]: which weights the volume by solar radiation or illumination levels, and therefore should show how 3D adjacencies effect the envelope/fan.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDoes this answer your question?\n\n\n\nS.\n\n\n\n[1]\u00a0[http://senseable.mit.edu/papers/pdf/2008_Morello_Ratti_Journal%20of...](http://senseable.mit.edu/papers/pdf/2008_Morello_Ratti_Journal%20of%20Computers%20and%20the%20Environment.pdf) \u00a0\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "January 21, 2015 at 10:18PM", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1208876", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1208888"}
