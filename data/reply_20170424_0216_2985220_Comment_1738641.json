{"body": "\nThank you very much Chris for your quick answer!\n\nI absolutely agree with the idea to change only one layer in order to better take into account all physical parameters of the other layers.\n\nAs for my case, I could even run a first THERM simulation of the whole first floor wall with the thermal bridge in order to understand (by looking for examples at temperatures) at what height I should \"break\" the first floor wall\u00a0into two different surfaces. (See attached pdf) Then I could create the surfaces in my E+ model accordingly and run a focused THERM simulation for the thermally bridged part of the wall above the thermal bridge (cyan box, second column of the scheme) and do the other E+ building component with typical values without the THERM simulation. This way there should be a better numerical representation of the phenomenon even in terms of surface temperature and so on...\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1738642", "name": "Therm_Energyplus_question2.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Filippo", "created_at": "April 24, 2017 at 02:16AM", "created_by": "Filippo", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1737609", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1738641"}
