{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\n\n\nHere you go &gt; ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly)) Do you have a github account?\n\n\n\nI talked to Stefan and he will be also helping with the project. Right now he sent me an example for a simple room with two windows which will be the first case to complete.\n\n\n\nI wonder if you can help with the 2D part development. Let's get a very simple 2D case exported to OpenFOAM. Do you have an example file that runs with no issues?\n\n\n\nBack to grid, we will be using OpenFOAM's meshing plugins such as snappyHexMesh ([http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/snappyhexmesh/](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/snappyhexmesh/)) and visualize it back into Rhino.\n\n\n\nLet's continue the conversations on github. I need to contact a couple of more people who can probably help us with the development and testing, and then we can have the kick-off meeting at some point on hangout/skype.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 21, 2015 at 8:13am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1328539", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1329657"}
