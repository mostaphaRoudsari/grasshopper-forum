No surface information was found in the imported .eio file adjacent to the .csv _resultFileAddress.Data cannot be normalized by surface area and the data tree outputs for surface data will not be grafted by zone\". It's a long time that I'm trying to figure out what's the problem..could you please have a look to the file?THANK YOU SO MUCH\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1523376", "name": "error_noshade.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ernesto Cesario", "created_at": "May 5, 2016 at 4:36am", "created_by": "ErnestoCesario", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1233399", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1523374"}
