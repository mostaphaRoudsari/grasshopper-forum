{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and all,\n\nWhile investigating the impact of internal blind on occupants' thermal comfort, I became curious about how we calculate the surface temperature of internal blind. Is it something that I can check in Honeybee work flow?\n\nI understand that we can calculate\u00a0surface temperature effect from the Energy simulation results and the HBZone geometry combined with an MRT delta using the SolarCal method in Honeybee. I just wonder that if we assume an internal blind (such as fabric roller shade) is deployed to block the direct solar radiation, how we calculate MRT. I think thermal comfort should be calculated based on the surface temperature of the internal blind, not the glass surface as the surface temperature between blind and the glass could be quite different.\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if it is already being discussed/ if there is any Honeybee workflow I can follow to get the surface temperature of internal blind.\n\nThanks,\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "WON HEE KO", "created_at": "May 24, 2017 at 05:26PM", "created_by": "WONHEEKO", "topic": "Surface temperature of internal blind", "id": "topic_1757097"}
