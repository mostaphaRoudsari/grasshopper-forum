{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nI was playing around with this a bit, and noticed that the bottom face (even when clearly not exposed to the sun) still receives radiation according to the study.\n\nThe normals of the faces are all correct, so that isn't the issue. I was wondering if maybe the simulation assumes a default material? Perhaps radiation is being transmitted?\n\n\n\nHow can I avoid these skewed results?\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nMike\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mike Johnson", "created_at": "March 29, 2017 at 10:01pm", "created_by": "MikeJohnson", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1722946", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1723859"}
