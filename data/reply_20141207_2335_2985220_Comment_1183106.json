{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI'm going to make this hard for you :-)\n\nThe dynamic schedule is a must (i.e. Shading Control object). I myself am trying to solve this midpane issue for my research and it is indeed more complicated than i thought. One of the issues i have is that i really like using the SingleGlazing object (define only U, SHGC and VT). Then i don't think i can't use the midpane with this object (is it?). But the possibility of opening or closing the blinds/drapes is really needed. Moreover, the possibility of opening/closing at desired rates (10%, 50% etc) and not only full open/close situation, which fits using a roller blind (which also requires special definitions).\n\nIn short ... complicated issue.\n\nAs for the results, are you saying that cooling loads are lower with midpane than with external blinds? Suspicious result ... but maybe that can happen becouse they are closed all the time. But your heating loads are higher, right?\n\nToo much stuff in this discussion. Nice!\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 07, 2014 at 11:35PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182998", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183106"}
