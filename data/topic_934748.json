{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI just started fiddling around with Ladybug. I'm trying to plot the radiation during the day on a curved surface. So, I want to calculate 24 values, one for each hour, of kWh/m2 for the entire surface. I want to graph this, so I expect some kind of peak radiation during the day. I want to do this as a cumulative value for an entire year (so still 24 values).\n\n\n\nIs this possible in Ladybug?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Diederik Veenendaal", "created_at": "October 18, 2013 at 9:18am", "created_by": "DiederikVeenendaal", "topic": "Cumulative hourly radiation", "id": "topic_934748"}
