{"body": "\nHey Brent,\n\nI can't see the image but I guess you get the error that LB_Preparation has no numOfDaysEachMonth\u00a0method?\n\nIf that is the case then you have an older version of Ladybug flying in your Grasshopper. Make sure the version of Ladybug_Ladybug component matches the version of sunpath. Let the 'bug fly and then try again. It should work fine.\n\nLet me know if it wasn't the issue at all! As I said, for some reason, I can't see the image that you posted.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 28, 2014 at 10:40am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1017513", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1017441"}
