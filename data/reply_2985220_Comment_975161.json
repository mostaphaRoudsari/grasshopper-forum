{"body": "\nHi Leland,\n\n\n\nGood to see you here. This is a minor known bug that I actually forget to fix. Thank you for reporting it.\n\n\n\nThe problem happens only for the last hour of year. Checked the attached file for the fixed version. Replace the new Ladybug from the file from what you have in your computer.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bquVoc42xDO0BUzgsjVV1qp8MQE6U49tDe3rkFjPd54pwywNgn8S1YnAXeISrcXrwHQ0sEtEarC587KuYQF1lV17lLeNoqpH/Leland_HOY_bug.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bquVoc42xDO0BUzgsjVV1qp8MQE6U49tDe3rkFjPd54pwywNgn8S1YnAXeISrcXrwHQ0sEtEarC587KuYQF1lV17lLeNoqpH/Leland_HOY_bug.png)\n\n\n\nYou can use separateData component to separate the numbers from the headings of the lists add all the numbers (for all the skies) together and then use one of the sky headers to create a valid Ladybug list. You can use that list (which is your custom sky) for your analysis. Very interesting to see advanced uses of Ladybug like this.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A975163", "name": "Leland_HOY_bug.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 17, 2013 at 5:55pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_974985", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_975161"}
