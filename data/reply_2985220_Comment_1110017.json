But as the help file of weather tool said the reference temperatures are 26 for cooling and 18 for heating. So I assume that the help file is rather not up to date or completely wrong. Coming from Autodesk I'm not surprised.\n\nthank you for your answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "August 2, 2014 at 8:54pm", "created_by": "Claudio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1109764", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1110017"}
