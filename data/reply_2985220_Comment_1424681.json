{"body": "\nHi Khalid and chris,\n\nIf you're interested in the horizontal sky illuminance you can set a test point with no obstruction and then use\u00a0\"Read All the Hourly Results from Annual Daylight Study\" to read the results.\n\nChris is correct about why values are calculated at .5 hour and not the start of the hour. The timestep is still hourly though.\n\nFinally, Daysim is capable of generating the results for timesteps less than an hour ([http://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-subprogram-ds-shortterm-1](http://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-subprogram-ds-shortterm-1)). We are not currently exposing it in Honeybee though.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 21, 2015 at 9:44am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1422756", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1424681"}
