{"body": "\nHi djordje,\n\nThank you very much for your response. I will keep in mind to attach the .gh files in the future.\n\nHowever, the isocurves still don't appear, even in the .gh file you sent me.\n\nThe visually appealing display of the shading percents do not really seem to work either. It doesn't bake it when the boolean toggle is set to True. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.\n\nHere's your .gh file I've edited, in case I'm overseeing something.\n\nThank you.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1560993", "name": "Ladybug_Photovoltaics_TOF_results_preview edited.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Erik Pelicaen", "created_at": "July 6, 2016 at 3:11pm", "created_by": "ErikPelicaen", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1561073", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1560992"}
