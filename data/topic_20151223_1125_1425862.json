{"body": "\nI see that you add recently an HB component to export the thermal bridge with material and boundary condition in THERM. Awesome! \u00a0Now I want to add the PSI value of the thermal bridge (linear thermal transmittance) calculated with THERM in the energy simulation. What is the best way to do that in grasshopper and Honeybee? I don't have any idea how to add the\u00a0linear thermal transmittance to the energy plus simulation HB\u00a0component.\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "domenico pullino", "created_at": "December 23, 2015 at 11:25AM", "created_by": "0btlmane0m02h", "topic": "Thermal Bridge - with THERM", "id": "topic_1425862"}
