{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nThank you for responding.\n\nI started with an overly clomplex model and had lots of trouble with adjacencies. Then it was so big that it just would\u00b4t run. \u00a0I am trying to simplify it as much as possible to then just write an OSM file to work with it on OpenStudio and see if I can do some studies of a VRF system cooled with either water or air. Also I think I might need to export two OSM files and I\u00b4m not sure how to merge them. I saw a thread Chris Mackey posted about doing that in sketchup\u00b4s openstudio plugin. \u00a0I am not sure if the honeybee-OpenStudio path is a smart way to do a detailed model.\n\nI\u00b4m attaching the files in case you want to take a look.\n\n\n\nThanks again\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1789759", "name": "20170607CLE-Simplificado.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1789760", "name": "20170607CLE-Simplificado.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "LUIS ARTURO REYES VALENCIA", "created_at": "July 27, 2017 at 06:47PM", "created_by": "LUISARTUROREYESVALENCIA", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1789751", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1789757"}
