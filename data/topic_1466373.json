{"body": "\nWhen I complete many Solve Adjacencies (solveAdjc), the program fails to \"Decompose Based on Type\" for some reason, getting hung up. Granted this could be my crappy computer, but it does seem there is some garbage accumulating in the honeybee behind the scenes stuff that is clogging up my ability to get at the solutions as I step through building the model.\n\n\n\nThis occurs only at the final \"solve adjacencies\", where I join the previously solved sets of zones. There are 9 solves in all. In all I only have 32 zones, and I sequentially solve adjacencies so as to control the constructions joining sets of zones. Basically I was trying to have AIR WALLS connect floors and some adjacent zones similar to what was done in the YouTube tutorials created by Mr. Mackey.\n\n\n\nI've tried joining them in numerous ways to no avail. The program seems to get hung up only when I try to display the results, as in the surface sorting and what not.\n\n\n\nPerhaps there is a simpler way for me to stitch together my zones?\n\n\n\nAny help would be appreciated!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1466371", "name": "eplus_generator_000.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1466372", "name": "thermal_model_geometry.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Robert Beach", "created_at": "February 18, 2016 at 4:05pm", "created_by": "RobertBeach", "topic": "Limit to Decomposing Zones", "id": "topic_1466373"}
