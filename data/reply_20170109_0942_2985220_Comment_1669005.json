{"body": "Riccardo,\n\nThank you for doing the validation and there's no worries about the support. Having another validation and understanding of Ladybug+Hobeybee in relation to other software packages is well worth it. I will take a look at your GH file as soon as I get the chance. The only thing I would be sure to check in the meantime is that the 3 types of heating degree days that OpenStudio uses (sensible heat, high wind, and humidifcation) are the same that these other software's are using. In particular, make sure that they are using the wind design day.\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 09, 2017 at 09:42AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1666187", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1669005"}
