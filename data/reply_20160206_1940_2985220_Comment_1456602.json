{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for that, looks like a very nice way to do it!\n\n\n\n@Ludvig\n\n\n\nThought that this could possible be of interest to you.\n\n\n\nDanny's definition apparently places the windows and tests for a valid boundary between the wall (valid = no overlapp). He then stores the fitness of those boundaries only in the optimization process. Geometrically it seems close to what Mostapha is doing only taking an opposite route of creating windows first taking region after. I have to warn you I haven't tested it myself yet.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 06, 2016 at 07:40PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455773", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1456602"}
