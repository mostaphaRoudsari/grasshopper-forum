{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nThanks for the help and looking at the problem. Just a couple of things.\u00a0\n\n\n\n1. To update Honeybee and Ladybug, I just need to open that grasshopper file, correct? I assume I'll need to close out of grasshopper and rhino for it to go into affect, right?\n\n\n\n2. You mentioned I could comment the line\u00a0**hb_writeRADAUX.checkInputParametersForGridBasedAnalysis().\u00a0**What does that exactly mean and how do I do that?\u00a0\n\n\n\n3. It appeared that I was getting the same result for both tests. So if that's the case, I would do number 2 to skip the extra check. Is that correct?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nGeof\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Geof Wright", "created_at": "January 10, 2016 at 01:42PM", "created_by": "GeofWright", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435696", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435843"}
