{"body": "\nHi Albert,\n\nSorry for responding so late. \u00a0I am glad that Mostapha addressed your issue with the orienting of geometry to the camera.\n\nTo be honest, I had never heard of a\u00a0Mollier i,x diagram before but I Google image searched it and it seems to be no different than a psychrometric chart that is rotated 90 degrees. \u00a0If I am correct in this assumption, this should be relatively easy to implement. \u00a0I would just add a few lines of code to rotate all of the geometry of the chart and re-orient the text such that it appears upright.\n\nLet me know if my assumption about the\u00a0Mollier i,x diagram is correct and I will implement it. \u00a0Also, google seems to think that the chart is called a\u00a0Mollier hx diagram. \u00a0Is this true?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 21, 2015 at 03:46PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1206666", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1208864"}
