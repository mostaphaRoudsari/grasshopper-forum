{"body": "\nHi Taizo,\n\n\n\nI am not sure if you can simply convert data from one format to another. The values that are found in Window 7.4 correspond to measurements made through a photogoniometer: [http://www.pab.eu/gonio-photometer/](http://www.pab.eu/gonio-photometer/)\n\n\n\nThe values that you saw in the image are radiation values from the BSDF file.
