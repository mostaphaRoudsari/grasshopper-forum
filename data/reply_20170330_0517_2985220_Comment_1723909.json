{"body": "\nI did some other tests and still there are ambigous outputs:\n\n\n\n1. The analysis with pts vectors input is not sensible to the surface colour while the one where only the testPoints is plugged in it is sensible. meaning: if the reflectance of the surface is set to 1 (white) or 0 (black) the results are equal for the simulation where pts vectors are plugged in and very different for the one where it's not plugged in.\n\n\n\n2. The same analysis made with Ladibug radiation analysis gives different results!\n\nI attach the files so maybe someone can help me understand!\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\nf\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1724210", "name": "Comparison.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1724211", "name": "Comparison.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1724212", "name": "Comparison.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Filippo", "created_at": "March 30, 2017 at 05:17AM", "created_by": "Filippo430", "parent_id": "topic_1723881", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1723909"}
