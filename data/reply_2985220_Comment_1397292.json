You don't need to create child surfaces. In case you want to use the model for Energy modeling then you should consider limitations of energy modeling. You can break down this surface into two U-shaped surface for instance.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 9, 2015 at 10:25pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1396822", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1397292"}
