{"body": "\nHi John,\n\nSolveAdjacencies component doesn't intersect. It requires intersected same geometries to match between\u00a0zones and assign some constructions and boundary conditions of the surfaces(like Adiabatic, Outdoor, Ground and etc.).\n\nIntersect mass component, take a list of close breps, and split their surfaces to ensure that there are\u00a0matched\u00a0surfaces\u00a0between breps.\n\nbecause \u00a0Energyplus in the analysis looking for heat flows in the surfaces and if EP cannot find match surfaces between two zones you have some\u00a0error about this after simulation.\n\nbest,\n\nOmid.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Omid Rashidi", "created_at": "August 15, 2017 at 3:24pm", "created_by": "OmidmRashidi", "parent_id": "topic_1799114", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1799129"}
