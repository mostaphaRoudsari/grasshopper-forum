{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\n\u00a0I am trying to understand how the lenght of a paramtric dynamic louver affects the lux value on a test surface; the issue I'm facing is that everytime I change the louver lenght HoneeyBee starts a new analysis and this process will take too much time.\n\nThe final target is to find (with Galapagos) the best lenght of the louver to guarantee an average lux value on the surface (this part in not yey inserted in the definition).\n\n\n\nSo the question is, is there a way to change the louver lenght and obtain the different grid results without HoneyBee starting a new analysis? (maybe by calculating some sort of matrix?)\n\n\n\nI attachg the .gh definition and the Weater file (the weater file is not essential, you can use one that you already have to test the algorithm).\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nDavide.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1795506", "name": "ITA_Treviso-Volpago del Montello.epw"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1795507", "name": "Parametric dynamic shading.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Davide Girardi", "created_at": "August 08, 2017 at 09:14AM", "created_by": "DavideGirardi", "topic": "Change shading geometry without re-doing the analysis", "id": "topic_1795508"}
