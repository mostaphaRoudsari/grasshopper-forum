{"body": "\nAlejandro,\n\nMostapha is referring to an issue that I fixed long ago with Abraham but that is not your issue. \u00a0There was a weird bug in the matching of names between the .eio file and the .csv result file. \u00a0I put in an extra check and this fixed your issue. \u00a0The file with the fixed component is attached and uploaded the new result reader to the github.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3pbaBKayUO9hwFV5uiSrv1B63*6TsXDA3Qb94dJ3AHacOFIcOB43nfhSdOGSX1Z8-wZVjgDfjlE8acUAmuS5vb2U68*pINuq/ResultReaderOK.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3pbaBKayUO9hwFV5uiSrv1B63*6TsXDA3Qb94dJ3AHacOFIcOB43nfhSdOGSX1Z8-wZVjgDfjlE8acUAmuS5vb2U68*pINuq/ResultReaderOK.PNG)\n\nOn another note, you use a component that is only meant to edit geometry (not HBZones) in the middle of an HBZones workflow:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3pbaBKayUO-KYglgsLOEQwo8223luLcDD6WIzA1TqLiU2zKNz4BBnnLRZShUDbLwm-Scmm7Sxtch4ynZAxQ8YBBPSVeRwxLF/TheProblem.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3pbaBKayUO-KYglgsLOEQwo8223luLcDD6WIzA1TqLiU2zKNz4BBnnLRZShUDbLwm-Scmm7Sxtch4ynZAxQ8YBBPSVeRwxLF/TheProblem.PNG)\n\nYou should use the intersect masses component before you change the breps to zones. I did this in the attached file before even bringing the masses into the file and the zone breps that you start with are now correctly ready to go for energy simulation.\n\nAs the error on the Read EP Result component\u00a0suggests, the simulation was not being run correctly because of this and no result file was generated.\n\nAlso, I noticed that you changed all adjacent boundary conditions to adiabatic and I really do not recommend this when you have the whole building modeled like this. \u00a0Your cooling loads will likely be a lot higher than reality because the heat will not flow from zone to zone, thereby getting trapped in your zones.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183175", "name": "AGHBeeReadEPResultsIssue_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 07, 2014 at 06:04PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183144", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183173"}
