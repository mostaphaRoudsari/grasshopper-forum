{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\n\n\nthanks a lot.\n\nI have seen your suggestion and I have some questions:\n\n- if I try to run Peter's model, it doesn't recognize the windows. Don't I need to use\u00a0'addHBGlz' component?\n\n- Abraham's solution works fine, but it seems it can be complicated to manage if I have more than one room. Is it correct? How can I do if I have for example 3-4 spaces with more than one window type on the walls?\n\n- Is my previous 'cascade' approach wrong? Because I obtain results but I am not sure the model works fine.\n\n\n\nThanks again.\n\n<br/>Riccardo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Riccardo Diaferia", "created_at": "June 4, 2015 at 2:26am", "created_by": "RiccardoDiaferia49", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1302312", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1302353"}
