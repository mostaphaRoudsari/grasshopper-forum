{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nmy problem now is that even if in Rhino I have a closed plysurface (joining all the surfaces), in Grasshopper-HoneyBee I still have an open Brep.\n\nThe thing to have more than one floor could be the problem?? I mean, the roof of the first floor is the floor of the second floor (sorry for the word pun).\n\nCould be that the problem??\n\nThanks in advance\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1548126", "name": "Floor.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1548127", "name": "Floor.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 15, 2016 at 02:24AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1547571", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1548125"}
