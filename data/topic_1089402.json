{"body": "\nHello every one,\n\nI run in to a problem while doing a DLA analysis. First of all let me explain the project. We\u2019ve created an artificial topography with 2 courtyards that brings daylight to a library organized around the courtyards.\n\nBecause the geometry it\u2019s a bit complex I did not used the HB Masses to \u00a0Zones component. I\u2019ve also give the surfaces and massing a singular white opaque material as I only care for the window (glass material). I just want to calculate the DLA index on the surfaces of the library that it\u2019s organized around the courtyards.\n\nSo any help would be much appreciate. We are at stage that we need to understand the daylight amount in the library as it\u2019s a very important area of the project\n\nAttached you\u2019ll find the weather file, rhino and gh file\n\nThank you all in advance\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/p5H7N8Ot6oOU52ffs2oqpGbRxNEsupibB4iPvE7c*9LfB1z25*tHgbLYqi4RAlu5Z6pdRkJOU7pjF2rNaSAa-dvG6BDsgSnD/screencapture01.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/p5H7N8Ot6oOU52ffs2oqpGbRxNEsupibB4iPvE7c*9LfB1z25*tHgbLYqi4RAlu5Z6pdRkJOU7pjF2rNaSAa-dvG6BDsgSnD/screencapture01.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1089399", "name": "CAN_PQ_Montreal.Jean.Brebeuf.716278_CWEC.epw"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1089400", "name": "Esquisse_05_Env_Analysis.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1089401", "name": "esquisse-05_DL.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "June 17, 2014 at 9:13am", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "HB Annual Simulation Problems", "id": "topic_1089402"}
