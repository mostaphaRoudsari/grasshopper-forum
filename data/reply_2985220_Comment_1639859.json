{"body": "\nHi Antoine, Sorry for the delay.\n\n1. You couldn't get the Honeybee objects since the TypeHint for GHPython component wasn't set to GeometryBase. I started debugging your component but didn't finish it.\n\n2. I'm attaching another file that shows how you can change the two surfaces to AIR WALL and then solve the adjacencies for the rest of the model. I put them in a new file since I'm using a newer version of Honeybee which will break your old definitions. You can recreate it with the older version and it should work.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1639860", "name": "HolecreationTest_msr.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1639861", "name": "airwall_adjacencies_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 15, 2016 at 8:42am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1637524", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1639859"}
