{"body": "\nThe radiation rose gives numeric values about the solar radiation per m2. These are referred to a surface tilted on the xy plane of the 'tilt angle' (0=xy, 90=vertical) and oriented to the angle the scheme returns (you can decide the number with '_numOfArrows'). The point you insert represent where this surface is set, and the 'context' brep the buildings you might have around yours.\n\nTo sum up, this component do not compute the total radiation on your building but just the radiation on the sample surface I described up. To do the radiation analysis you need the 'Ladybug_radiation analysis' component that will make a ray trace calculation for you building.\n\nI hope I have been understandable\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "April 26, 2014 at 11:33am", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1059477", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1059533"}
