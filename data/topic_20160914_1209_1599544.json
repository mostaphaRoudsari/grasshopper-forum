{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI am creating a custom tool for calculating only design heating and cooling loads.\n\nI am not working on energy modelling. I would like to analyze the peak heating and cooling loads for a specific period (i.e. winter season, summer season) in order to design the HVAC systems).\n\nHow can I model it correctly? Do you have some suggestion?\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\nRiccardo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Riccardo Diaferia", "created_at": "September 14, 2016 at 12:09PM", "created_by": "RiccardoDiaferia49", "topic": "Heating and Cooling loads", "id": "topic_1599544"}
