{"body": "\nHi Allyson,\n\nAbraham is right! This is a place holder and I found it not really necessary to implement. Daysim logic is already sort of a blackbox and I believe user_profile will add one more layer on top of that. You can hack the hea file and change the user_profile by adding a single line.\n\nIn any case my question for you is why do you need to change the user_profile?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 24, 2016 at 7:56pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1660380", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1662563"}
