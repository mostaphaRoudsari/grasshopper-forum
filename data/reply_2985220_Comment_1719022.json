{"body": "\nHi Aris,\n\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to reply. The intended model area is my university campus. I am looking towards either modelling the whole area at once or doing separate microscale models of different regions in the campus. To be honest, this depends really on what software I can use easily for either option.\n\n\n\nI have already tried ENVI-MET and it seems really straightforward to use however the simulation time is extremely slow and there are limitations to using the free version.\n\n\n\nWith regards your other suggestions, there are going to be issues for me in learning them as it seems a lot are based around Python language which I am completely new to. There is a lot of information available on the applications but without this basic understanding of Python etc. my interpretation is very limited.\n\n\n\nI will keep trying with ENVI-MET for now but thereafter, maybe UMEP is the best option.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nDeclan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Declan Fay", "created_at": "March 23, 2017 at 3:23am", "created_by": "DeclanFay", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1718870", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1719022"}
