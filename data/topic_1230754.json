{"body": "\nHey everyone,\n\n\n\nNeed to clarify something bugging me. When we create zones through surfaces, and then in one or more of those surfaces we create custom geometry for windows, do we have to link both the opaque surface and the opaque surface+glazing to the create zones icon? I would think just one but don't know why i'm not sure.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 24, 2015 at 3:23am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Kind of a silly question", "id": "topic_1230754"}
