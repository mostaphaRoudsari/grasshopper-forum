{"body": "\nAlejandro,\n\nThanks for finding this. \u00a0I blank out the analysisPeriod input in the case where EnergyPlus simulation results are not annual to try to show that this input only works for annual energy simulation results. \u00a0However, the component should not go red like that in the case that you do hook up an analysis period. \u00a0It is not going red on my system and I am not sure why:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4t8Bu5s6lgSiw3T8eBRW9gX3VK4UtrUzu1YFwBrYStN1o8uXmZN6Urh5-6M8*XFqkycGO5SbRPWlKNVs6bBkDDZiq2MMyf*Q/AnalysisPeriodOK.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4t8Bu5s6lgSiw3T8eBRW9gX3VK4UtrUzu1YFwBrYStN1o8uXmZN6Urh5-6M8*XFqkycGO5SbRPWlKNVs6bBkDDZiq2MMyf*Q/AnalysisPeriodOK.PNG)\n\nI guess it's really not much of an issue but let me know if you get it to work with the analysis period still plugged in.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 2, 2014 at 10:37am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1178884", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1179818"}
