{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI'm currently attempting to make a Sunlight Hours Study across a topography model using Ladybug. For some reason it is coming up as the entire model as 0 hours of daylight, even when I put in the summer solstice. Any idea what I'm doing wrong? Is the daylight hours study only usable with building models and not topography?\n\n\n\n-Ben\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "BC", "created_at": "October 14, 2013 at 7:14pm", "created_by": "BC", "topic": "Topography in Ladybug", "id": "topic_931647"}
