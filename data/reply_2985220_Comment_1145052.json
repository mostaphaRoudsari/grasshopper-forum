{"body": "\nHey Guys,\n\nI have new information to report. \u00a0I have found the specific surface that causes the problem. \u00a0From what I can tell, the issue only happens when you have geometry that has been created with one Rhino model tolerance and then internalized into GH but then our components act on it using a different Rhino model tolerance. \u00a0So, as long as the user is creating geometry and using out components all within the same tolerance, there should never be any issues. \u00a0It just happens in our case here because I created the house geometry with a tolerance of 0.001 but, then, when Abraham opened it on his system, the component generated a mesh off of that geometry with a tolerance of 0.01. \u00a0Accordingly, this caused that little sliver of a triangle in the image below to not be a mesh face and this later caused my component to fail. \u00a0I am going to put in a warning about the tolerance so that users know what to do the next time that this happens.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4hNukqhfhE1i1h-KhwyNnyxWSmm9pqrSk4ynjSMxz8ufp94VBXHADOO9TilHSNVvChs9vAmLXYsQWCL1K02yl0660oQyGK6v/Toleranceissue.PNG?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4hNukqhfhE1i1h-KhwyNnyxWSmm9pqrSk4ynjSMxz8ufp94VBXHADOO9TilHSNVvChs9vAmLXYsQWCL1K02yl0660oQyGK6v/Toleranceissue.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 8, 2014 at 12:26am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1144978", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1145052"}
