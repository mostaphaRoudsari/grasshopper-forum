{"body": "\nI\u2019ve been trying to Run HoneyBeeEnergy Modeling Script. I keep getting too many values to unpack on the Honeybee_Indoor Radiant Temperature Map.\n\n\n\nUsually when this happens it\u2019s a versioning problem in this case the component has not been updated since 2014. However, the IndoorViewFactor has been updated and does not correspond with the inputs for Radiant Temp Map. I attach the files for your review if you have some time to impart your insight.\u00a0 I left both versions of the components in the Script.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1601403", "name": "HoneyBeeEnergyModeling_HELP_msr.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1601404", "name": "Site_Ladybug_Shadow_Forum Post.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Gjergjji Shkurti", "created_at": "September 18, 2016 at 3:58pm", "created_by": "GjergjjiShkurti", "topic": "Honeybee_Indoor Radiant Temperature Map", "id": "topic_1601405"}
