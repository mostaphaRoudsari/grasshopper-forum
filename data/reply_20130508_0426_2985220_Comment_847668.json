{"body": "\nHi Jose,\n\nI prefer using Octopus for multi-objective optimization with SPEA-2 evolutionary algorithm. You can find the optimum solution for solar radiation, dayligh calculation or heating and cooling periods. Here, you have one objective which is just solar radiation. In my opinion, there should more objectives for tower generations which makes it better! Please check the video for using Octopus with Ladybug...\n\nBest,\n\nB.\n\n\n\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c32kZN19FU](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c32kZN19FU)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Berk Ekici", "created_at": "May 08, 2013 at 04:26AM", "created_by": "BerkEkici", "parent_id": "topic_847505", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_847668"}
