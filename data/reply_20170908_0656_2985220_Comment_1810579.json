{"body": "\nIan,\n\nGood question and this actually got me to realize that there's a much cleaner way of calculating the radiant temperature on each side of the plane of the person. \u00a0I was originally multiplying by 2 to convert the fraction of the sphere around the person to the fraction of the plane on either side of the person. \u00a0Since a plane can only see up to half of a sphere, it has to be multiplied by 2 to be converted (or, to be technical, it actually has to multiplied by 2*cos(theta) where theta is the angle between a given view vector and the normal vector of the plane).\n\nIn any case, since the original creation of that example, I have added in the ability to automatically calculate plane view factors if you plug a plane into the _testPtsOrPlanes input of the Surface View Factor component (instead of a point). \u00a0This means much less post processing of the results and a cleaner Grasshopper definition. \u00a0So I have just updated the example here:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Radiant_Asymmetry_Discomfort&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\nThanks for bringing my attention to this!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 08, 2017 at 06:56AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1809653", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810579"}
