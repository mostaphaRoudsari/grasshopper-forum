{"body": "\nThis is a very interesting discussion, especially with the upcoming LEED v4.\n\n\n\nI will soon try some calculations of the sort, I actually did use Chris's definition with very good results so far. However, I did not compare results to v4 criteria yet. In my specific region, I would think achieving ASE would be very easy due to very low direct illuminance, which makes it interesting for other people around the world to share any results they get on this.\n\n\n\nI had a question on Alstan's presentation. Is it a LEED requirement or a sensible thing to calculate sDA by compiling the 3 scenarios detailed there. Is this how the calculation is performed in HB as well? By combining shades open/close and ab=0? I must be getting that slide (8) wrong I guess.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 30, 2016 at 12:38am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1400028", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519246"}
