{"body": "Julien,\n\nIf you bake your HBZone breps and bring the geometry back into Grasshopper, they will be raw geometry and not have their HBZone properties anymore such that you can pass them through the intersect masses component. You can then use this intersected geometry to make correct HBSurfaces and build up your zones from this correct geometry.\n\nIf that is not clear, this video might help:\nhttps://youtu.be/cDvBWDA0aF0\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 24, 2015 at 08:58AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1248711", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1249154"}
