{"body": "\nHi Ahmed,\n\n\n\nIn the same way you export idf files for your glazing constructions you can export BSDF files for your glazing from Window. I think if you put these settings to Window, calculating your U/SC values will create the BSDF reports which you can then export. You can then use the Honeybee_Radiance BSDF material component to import it in your definition.\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1769790", "name": "BSDF_window.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "June 15, 2017 at 09:20PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1767475", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1769788"}
