{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\n\n\nHaving an official LB+HB tolerance seems to be a bit dangerous. \u00a0From the perspective of Ladybug, this is clearly a conflict since we still want to support work in several types of unit systems and people are likely going to want a different tolerance depending upon the units used. \u00a0In Honeybee, it is less of an issue but it still seems dangerous. \u00a0Now I am wondering if EnergyPlus has a model tolerance and if we need to take this into account as well.\n\n\n\nTo deal with the mis-match between GH and Rhino model tolerance, I have started a discussion with the broader community:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/mismatch-between-rhino-mo...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/mismatch-between-rhino-model-tolerance-and-internalized-gh)\n\n\n\nOnce we get some thoughts from the GH gurus, I imagine that we can make a better decision. \u00a0Do you know if E+ has a tolerance or if there is a way to set this?\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 01, 2015 at 12:48PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1318461", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1318838"}
