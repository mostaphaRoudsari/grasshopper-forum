{"body": "\nHi Vinu,\n\n1. Chris means to update your components to the latest version (which lives on github). You can use update components to update your components or you can download it manually from Github. Here is an example for the new version of the component ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/is-there-a-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/is-there-a-quick-way-to-add-a-window-to-a-surface-of-a-zone?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1316675&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)).\n\n\n\n2. Thank you for sharing the image and the abstract. It's an interesting approach. I'm not sure if I understand how the feedback loop works but here is my 2 cents based on my current understanding.\n\nIf the geometry is not changing in your case I think the best approach for you is to export the idf file once from Honeybee, and then run your cases from the command line in the server.\n\nIn this case you will have one main .idf file which looks for some .csv files as the schedule. Now you can re-write the csv file and run the simulation from the command line and parse the results back.\n\nBased on the number of your scenarios you may want to have a couple of idf files for different cases and run them all in parallel. That should give you a better performance.\n\nI hope I understand your problem right! Feel free to continue the conversation here if you have any other questions.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 8, 2015 at 2:45pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1321613", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1322551"}
