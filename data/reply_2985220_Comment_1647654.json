{"body": "\nHi Olivier.\n\nSorry to interrupt, but your case study caught my attention as I was checking for any updates in the fora on Butterfly and temperature.\n\n\n\nThat is exactly because I am currently doing my masters thesis on exactly stratification in atria and big semi-outdoor rooms.<br/>I am testing a bunch of variables and I was thus looking into utilizing Butterfly. However, this new update came too late in the process for me to fully test out.\n\nI am very interested in your findings, as I had to go to the old fashion (and correct but yet very slow) way of using Ansys Fluent for my investigations.\n\nI would however very much like to compare my results with the ways of the parametric tools, i.e. Butterfly: How valid are the results of BF so far? What could be optimized? When is the parametric tool favourable over the hardcore tools when considering these factors? What are the future objectives?\n\n\n\nCould I therefore borrow your script later on at some point to use for my own to generate some analyses?<br/>Or would it maybe be possible for you to (in a month or so?) to create a very basic template script that is prepared for temperature analyses in an very simple atrium-like room maybe with an inlet and outlet as you are (or seem to be) making them? I am willing to go with NDA or give full credit to you and your work.\n\n\n\nVery interesting what you are doing!!\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nLasse Hamborg\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lasse Hamborg", "created_at": "November 28, 2016 at 2:37pm", "created_by": "LasseHamborg", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647202", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647654"}
