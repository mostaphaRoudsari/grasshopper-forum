{"body": "\nHi!\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy mistake about this post. Actually this was answered by Mostapha before:\u00a0Daysim\u00a0can't handle BSDF material. Check this discussion for possible solutions:\u00a0[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/563](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/563).\n\n\n\nHowever in this post on [Oct 2, 2016](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/563#issuecomment-251004036), \"For anyone who may read this discussion later. Th implementation is done in the newer version of Honeybee which is not yet publicly released for Grasshopper.\". I'm using the 2017 Feb 05 version of Honeybee, but it seems that the annual simulation still cannot handle BSDF material. Any thoughts? Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "XF", "created_at": "March 21, 2017 at 11:11am", "created_by": "XF", "parent_id": "topic_1716948", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1717553"}
