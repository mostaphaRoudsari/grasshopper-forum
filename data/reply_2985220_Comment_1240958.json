{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nI probably need to include this somewhere in the component description but the shades and windows are read as a parallel data tree structure. \u00a0So, if the shades are not on the same data tree branch as the window that they are shading, the two will not be analyzed together. \u00a0I found that data tree structure is necessary when you want to do a shade benefit for a large multi-zone building and I made the \"EnergyPlus Window Shade Creator\" to help make sure that these data trees are correctly aligned for large buildings.\n\nSo, the component does accept multiple windows but each window should be on its own branch with a corresponding set of branches that include the shades of each window.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 11, 2015 at 9:03pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240427", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240958"}
