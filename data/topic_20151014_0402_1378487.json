{"body": "\nDear experts,\n\n\n\nI am creating an energy plus model. The model is a 10-floor building that I have subdivided in 5 zones per floor with the relative component. I need to maintain the original windows on the facades, so I have extracted the external facades and added the windows as child surfaces.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThen, I have reattached the surfaces with the windows to the other surfaces and created the HBZones. The first doubt is here: Can I use the create_HBZone component to create more zones? Apparently, yes by adding the surfaces divided per branch.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEverting seems to go well until I use the solve adjacencies component. Passing 10 external zones to the component, these are putted one on the other, getting the 10 zones in the same place. I tried to pass the closed Brep to the solve component in different ways, but I got the same error or the adjacencies are not recognized!\u00a0What am I doing wrong?\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny suggestion is welcome!!\n\n\n\nEnclosed the gh file.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nGiuseppe\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1378486", "name": "Eplus_model.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "October 14, 2015 at 04:02AM", "created_by": "GiuseppeDM", "topic": "Problem with the solve adjacencies component", "id": "topic_1378487"}
