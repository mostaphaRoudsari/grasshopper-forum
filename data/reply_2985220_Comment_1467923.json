{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nYes, you are right. \u00a0I can't think of any way of setting that situation up that does not involve the HBSurface component or decomposing the zone and editing individual surfaces. \u00a0If you have a lot of this same type of condition, however, it is likely possible to set up all of them with one set of HBSurface components, though. \u00a0In the end, smart list management can usually eliminate the need for large numbers of components on the canvas.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 20, 2016 at 9:28pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1467315", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1467923"}
