{"body": "\nHi Ehsan,\n\nAnton's suggestion should solve your issue. The issue happens because Honeybee fails to figure out the adjacencies\u00a0correctly. Do you really need the geometry to be this complex? EnergyPlus will probably take a good amount of time to run the analysis for this geometry.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/c2myy45ArwM4Y-LsuVbR9eA-gDIzf7i2dM1EelIcUPj8GmOsN5ATfxLXigNlFw31WCYzGBobYkH72yk6nbE7wga5gy5fulqv/adjacency.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/c2myy45ArwM4Y-LsuVbR9eA-gDIzf7i2dM1EelIcUPj8GmOsN5ATfxLXigNlFw31WCYzGBobYkH72yk6nbE7wga5gy5fulqv/adjacency.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 9, 2016 at 10:12am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1611519", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1614723"}
