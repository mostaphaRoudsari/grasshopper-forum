{"body": "\nThank you Chris,\n\n\n\nI changed my components after updating Honeybee/Ladybug on my computer but the problem with the RunEnergyPlus component is not solved.\n\n\n\nI've tried to use the OpenStudio component but I get some issues with csv schedules. Strangely, the workaround you used to set csv schedule with OpenStudio is working well for all my schedules (occupancy, lighting, equipment...) except for the activity and ventilation ones. When I replace these two schedules with standard office buildings energy+ schedules, it works perfectly and I get the results for cooling and mechanical ventilation energy.\n\n\n\nWith the custom csv schedules for activity and ventilation, there is an error when writing the idf:\n\nPeople,<br/> ZoneSTD_PeopleObject, !- Name<br/> ZoneSTD, !- Zone or ZoneList Name<br/>SCHLAB_OCC, !- Number of People Schedule Name<br/> People/Area, !- Number of People Calculation Method<br/> , !- Number of People<br/> 0.044, !- People per Zone Floor Area {person/m2}<br/> , !- Zone Floor Area per Person {m2/person}<br/> 0.3, !- Fraction Radiant<br/> , !- Sensible Heat Fraction<br/> ; !- Activity Level Schedule Name\n\n\n\nThere is a blank instead of the activity schedule name and:\n\n\n\nDesignSpecification:OutdoorAir,<br/> ZoneSTD_DSOA, !- Name<br/> Sum, !- Outdoor Air Method<br/> 0, !- Outdoor Air Flow per Person {m3/s-person}<br/> 0.00513888888888889, !- Outdoor Air Flow per Zone Floor Area {m3/s-m2}<br/> 0, !- Outdoor Air Flow per Zone {m3/s}<br/> 0, !- Outdoor Air Flow Air Changes per Hour {1/hr}<br/>SCHLAB_VENTILATION\n\n\n\nThe ; after the schedule name is apparently missing.\n\n\n\nYou can see attached the report file.\n\nHow could I solve this issue in order to use my custom schedules?\n\n\n\nAymeric\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1731953", "name": "Honeybee_OSM_IDF_error.txt"}], "created_by_name": "Aymeric", "created_at": "April 12, 2017 at 05:12AM", "created_by": "AymericDELABACHELERIE", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1731532", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1731951"}
