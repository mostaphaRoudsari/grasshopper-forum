{"body": "\nFrancesco,\n\nSorry for the late reply. These are good questions and, to answer them:\n\n1) When you plug in a list of 8760 values with a header that says \"Dry Bulb Temperature,\" the component automatically does the math for you to figure out the prevailing outdoor temperature (whether this is averaging monthly temperature or calculating a running mean temperature). \u00a0However, when you plug in numbers that do not have a header on them, you have to do the math yourself and make sure that the values you plug in are representative of \"prevailing\" or average conditions and not the raw conditions themselves. \u00a0I am thinking that I should add a small component to help you calculate this when you have a raw data set but the code to do it is here:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/Ladybug...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/Ladybug_Adaptive%20Comfort%20Chart.py#L238-L266)\n\nI should also say that you can \"hack\" the methods of the component just by plugging in 8760 values with a header into prevailingOutdoorTemp and using dummy data to fill in all of the hours of the year that you do not have. You can then use the prevailingTemp output from the component and select out your analysis period to run a study on just your time of interest.\n\n2) \u00a0Using the \"monthly average\" option is a lot easier. If your study period is just a month, calculate the average of your data set's outdoor conditions and plug this since value in for _prevailingOutdoorTemp.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 10, 2017 at 02:20AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1809397", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1811611"}
