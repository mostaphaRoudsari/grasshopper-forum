{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nAnyone knows of a better way to save parametric model results than the native GH recorder?\n\n\n\nI am still using a variation of the pollination definition. But after I left my computer run around 3000 E+ simulations on my day off I came back to a Rhino crash which meant all (even if it was 99.99% of them) simulation data that were produced till then got lost..\n\n\n\nI know this isn't yet very popular but I'd love the idea of a component or workflow that makes this a bit more efficient. Is something as mandane as streaming the output of the recorder in a .csv file going to work (as a safeguard to possible crashes)?\n\n\n\nI'd love some ideas if someone has them!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "December 01, 2016 at 10:05PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1647993", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1650295"}
