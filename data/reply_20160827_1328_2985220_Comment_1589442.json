{"body": "\nJaved,\n\nTo be perfectly clear, the OpenStudio component generates an IDF after it writes an OSM file. \u00a0There is no loss of data between the HBZones and this final IDF and we deal with the fact that OpenStudio doesn't have full support of all E+ features by writing any non-OS-supported objects into this final IDF produced by the OpenStudio component (there are 5 capabilities in Honeybee that OpenStudio does not support that we have to use this workaround for). \u00a0So you can edit this IDF from the OpenStudio component in the IDFEditor or add additionalStrings to it just like you would with the E+ component. \u00a0I other words, there is not limit to what you can do. \u00a0The OpenStudio component is only adding capabilites. \u00a0It's not taking any away.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 27, 2016 at 01:28PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1588775", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1589442"}
