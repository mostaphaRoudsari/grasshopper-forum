{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Chris,\n\nJust finished to see the whole video series on HB. Awesome Chris!\n\nAfter that i have some questions regarding the addToEPLibrary component.\n\n1. Adding an element to the library will make this element available for all new GH file or just for the specific GH where it is defined?\n\n2. Where the library is located? It is the jason file?\n\n3. If i added an element to the library, and the general library is updated becouse of a new version of HB or any other reason, i will loose my \"personal\" elements? If so, how can i back them up?\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 07, 2014 at 12:04PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "HB material/construction/schedule library", "id": "topic_1144746"}
