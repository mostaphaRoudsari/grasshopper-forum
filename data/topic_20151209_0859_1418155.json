{"body": "\n\n\nI am trying to add internal windows to the core zone of a building with core and perimeter zones. I am passing this core zone through\u00a0addHBGlz and supplying the names of all it's walls into the input\u00a0childSurfacesName_.\n\n\n\nThe outcome that I would expect is that glazing should be added to each wall whose name I have specified in the input\u00a0childSurfacesName_. Instead however I receive a null output.\n\n\n\nIs this a bug? What should I be expecting? Chris or Mostapha if this is a bug then let me fix it myself ; ).\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1418154", "name": "addHBGlzing.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "December 09, 2015 at 08:59AM", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "topic": "addHBGlz not working as expected", "id": "topic_1418155"}
