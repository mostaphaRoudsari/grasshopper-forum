{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI am a novice user of you awesome plug-in. Currently I am using it in a project for which the corresponding weather data file for its specific location is not freely available. I found out that Whitebox Technologies sells IWEC2 historical weather data files (BINM, EPW (plus DDY file), and FIN4 text formats) for that particular location, but only in a year range from 2001 to 2012. Is this time frame reliable enough for running simulations using LB. Thank You!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland D.
