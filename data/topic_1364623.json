{"body": "\n\n\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nHas anyone run the daylighting and thermal simulation for expanded metal mesh?\n\nWhat I am using for my current project is called \"Okalux\" which looks like\u00a0[this](https://arch5541.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/des-moines-public-library_2-2.jpg). As you can see, it has a 3d shape which can function as shading devices -\u00a0not like a flat punching metal panel.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-M5JLAFxn1FVV4lRprxpShfnA8XHmbBlgdEq22mdHZPyNEIMioAoZ3KE-UPgOjxsbiPb*zoKbfI1ao-LJsfRzx15FJf7fxAX/Picture1.png\" width=\"485\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-M5JLAFxn1FVV4lRprxpShfnA8XHmbBlgdEq22mdHZPyNEIMioAoZ3KE-UPgOjxsbiPb*zoKbfI1ao-LJsfRzx15FJf7fxAX/Picture1.png)\n\nBasically what I would like to try is to check the DF/Illuminance and the solar gain before/after installing the expanded metal (there are several iterations), so I could use the output to optimize the density of the metal mesh.\n\nI am wondering if Ladybug+honeybee can support daylighting analysis using this components and also thermal analysis to check the solar gain.\n\nIf anyone can give any instruction or advice, that would be very much appreciated! I am attaching the product brochure\u00a0for your information:\u00a0[i_okatech_e.pdf](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-M5JLAFxn1FKMRmp*Rz44bUSXXBt5tGkoYXOJf7TLm6CE6VCBTX8XA0Nb4MRMla1YR*GsOvoF8UJnwtL-NdZqomLBZEfQ*6t/i_okatech_e.pdf)\n\nLook forward to hearing from you all!\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nSo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "So Young Hyun", "created_at": "September 18, 2015 at 4:00pm", "created_by": "SoYoungHyun", "topic": "Expanded metal mesh shading", "id": "topic_1364623"}
