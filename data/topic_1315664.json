{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI ran a big Eplus model (50 zones, ~1000 windows) and it crashed grasshopper when it tried to read the results file. See image below. I was trying to read zone results and energy flow data from each window surface at the same time. It appears that this is too much for my computer. Can anyone think of a way that I can get around this? Gathering 8760 data for each window surface really bumps up the data being brought in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt would be great if the \"read results\"\u00a0modules allowed us to select individual zones rather than bringing in all data. Is there a\u00a0way to\u00a0do this? I tried to bring in only those columns of data that I want directly from the\u00a0csv file but there is too much data. I have no idea what columns to choose based on my\u00a0zone/ window surface choice.\u00a0Any ideas? I'm open to any suggestions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/kZzo8PgK6ncymq0aHILSwvsyUHSjIbjAbvdzWpCOb4gDWVP*tVupUuweviEWTaDJmAyEYJ-wz3TS0n*s91SYx1bdUuHw1wkW/GHcrash.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/kZzo8PgK6ncymq0aHILSwvsyUHSjIbjAbvdzWpCOb4gDWVP*tVupUuweviEWTaDJmAyEYJ-wz3TS0n*s91SYx1bdUuHw1wkW/GHcrash.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "June 25, 2015 at 3:11pm", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "topic": "Honeybee EPlus crash: Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException'", "id": "topic_1315664"}
