{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nProbably a silly question. Does it matter, in terms of Energy+ simulation capabilities, if the perforated surface is interior or exterior to the wall? I have a case where the pattern is interior to the wall, I'm guessing I could simulate that case by setting an exterior shading context, would that be accurate?\n\n\n\nAlso, I understand the case of having windows which then have a perforated screen pattern over them. What, in your opinion, would be a good solution for an actual wall perforated pattern (wall has the \"holes\" as windows). It's madness I know, any idea is welcome.\n\n\n\nP.S.: I'm baseing most of the above in the assumption that E+ only accepts equivalents of thermal mass in interior spaces and not actually, concrete surfaces. Let me know if that is wrong and we can actually input solid, existing interior surfaces in E+.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 17, 2016 at 6:18am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1510315", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1510311"}
