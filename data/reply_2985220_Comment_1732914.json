{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI've installed everything on my system again. And still not able to get LB_GenCumulativeSkyMtx to work I get the same result.\n\nAlso. I've installed the latest version of OpenStudio 2.1.0 on my C drive and now HB does not recognized. My god!!! I'm so sad I cannot use LB any more. Something is broke...\n\nAny help would be much appreciated[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UIp6-tRQFla9z6uoddb7ypZ6QJqP2cD6OY37J0TKTKjsjBM-PYRUtPhtTHbFEg0jsBMPw7QtCYlF5yC6E19y0-LebRJ4gDAk/Canvasat112613.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UIp6-tRQFla9z6uoddb7ypZ6QJqP2cD6OY37J0TKTKjsjBM-PYRUtPhtTHbFEg0jsBMPw7QtCYlF5yC6E19y0-LebRJ4gDAk/Canvasat112613.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "April 13, 2017 at 9:27am", "created_by": "Claudio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1732830", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1732914"}
