{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI have some problems. I am also trying to run the annual DGP simulation with at list 4 different views (p0, p1, p2 and p3). these are defined correctly in rhino and locked as named views.\n\nBut when I added their names as a list to HB_DSParameters component and writ the rad file. it will generate the vf file which is not correct translation of my view locations and directions.\n\nYou mentioned that it is the limitation of Daysim and its way of calculation which will neglect my exact views. and I need to run them separately. But I think it is not the only problem.\n\nSince there is a clear example of A**nnual DGP profile ([http://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-file-type-annual-dgp-profile](http://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-file-type-annual-dgp-profile))** with different view points; it means we should be able to run DGP for multiple views.\n\nThere is also another issue in the way the vf file is generated. It is overwriting my view points. Please see the case I have attached the screenshots here. Could it be a problem with HB or Daysim itself will overwrite the points? (You will see in the figure T5.PNG that the lines 1 and 2 is exactly the same). And surprisingly when I have tried to change the one by one it will keep one view point always the same (Please see T6.PNG\u00a0). I don't know what could be the reason?\n\nSorry for the long explanation. I would really appreciate any comment and hint. Thanks.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1652479", "name": "T2.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1652480", "name": "T4.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Fazel Ganji", "created_at": "December 5, 2016 at 12:28pm", "created_by": "fazelganji", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1564093", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1652477"}
