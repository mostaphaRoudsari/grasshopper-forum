{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\nThis is a very good point. In general you are right and you can add glazing only to surfaces and not zones [which can get fixed by modifying the component. I think it totally makes sense to be able to add all the glazing to the zone at the same time]\n\nAt the same time, as far as you draw openings correctly on top of the surfaces (no gap between the opening surface and the wall/roof, and same normal direction), and know how to manage data in Grasshopper, you can do it all at once. check this example where I add a number of windows to two different zones. Honeybee_addHBGlazing component does the matching process inside.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-HoKvkav3swxFOWFyVHSPcPsx-x6dIEjH8RY5M4cZ1vIsmHpOslBBMhpGV08yxWK2Tq-HaHt7F-ptcqS3O6Weal5bFns9dvu/addMultipleGlazingToZones.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-HoKvkav3swxFOWFyVHSPcPsx-x6dIEjH8RY5M4cZ1vIsmHpOslBBMhpGV08yxWK2Tq-HaHt7F-ptcqS3O6Weal5bFns9dvu/addMultipleGlazingToZones.png)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1314267", "name": "addMultipleGlazingToZones.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 23, 2015 at 7:50am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1314045", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1314265"}
