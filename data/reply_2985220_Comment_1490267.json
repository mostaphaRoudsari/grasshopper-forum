{"body": "\nSam,\n\n\n\nYou can see here ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/161](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/161)) that this results from the fact the OpenStudio does not currently support the use of CSV schedules and we have to write a work-around in Honeybee to be able to get your Honeybee-assigned CSV schedules to be in your energy model.\n\n\n\nTo get rid of the component failure in your image, you are going to have to replace the 'OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf' in your ladybug default folder with the one on the github here:\n\n[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/master/...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/master/resources/OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf)\n\nI apologize for this extra step but this implementation of CSV schedule capability on OpenStudio was really meant to be a rough hack until the OpenStuido team implements this capability on their own software and SDK in a year or so.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 22, 2016 at 9:36am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1489760", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490267"}
