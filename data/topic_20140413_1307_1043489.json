{"body": "\nHi to everyone,\n\n\n\nin this tutorial (\u00a0[http://diva4rhino.com/page/simulating-luminaires-with-ies-files](http://diva4rhino.com/page/simulating-luminaires-with-ies-files)\u00a0) is shown a method to simulate a lamp in DIVA. Considering that the process is about a modding of radiance materials, do you think that it would be possible to do the same in honeybee?\n\n\n\nTo go deeper I have tried to do the tutorial about DIVA, but in its grasshopper version: it doesn't work. To be more precise, the material, applied to a brep, is not read by the\u00a0**DIVA\u00a0****daylight simulator.**\u00a0Actually I don't know if I'm mistaken about some details.\n\n\n\nit would be great if only it could be possible in honeybee! for instance I have found this study which is pretty interesting to calculate lamps power consumptions directly in honeybee:\u00a0[https://sites.google.com/site/just4architecture/research/responsive...](https://sites.google.com/site/just4architecture/research/responsive-lighting-system)\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nClaudio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "April 13, 2014 at 01:07PM", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "topic": "Simulating IES lamps file through RAD materials", "id": "topic_1043489"}
