{"body": "\nHi Chris, Mostapha, Theodore,\u00a0\n\nThanks for the interesting discussion and development. I have been testing the components since yesterday since I wanted to have something like that for some time now and is of great help. I was wondering though which component in the workflow is the one that assigns first the attribute 'transform' to the HB zones, since the components do not work in existing scripts without this attribute assigned to the zones. Thanks again for this is a great addition for extended projects!\n\n\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "November 6, 2015 at 1:58am", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "topic_1356815", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1393698"}
