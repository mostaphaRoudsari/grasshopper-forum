{"body": "\nHi Claudia.\n\nSorry for the delay. I was on the road.\n\nThe answer to your question is that this is indeed possible to read the matrix results. Pretty easily. See image. The top components show the \"regular\" way to stream the results. This is what you use and it calculates everytime the whole thing.\n\nThe bottom components show how you can read the results. Just set the writeResultFile_ to True and you are practically done. In the HB_ you need to conect the HB_readMicroclimateMtx which input , _comfResultFileAddress, should be the path of the result file you are interested in.\n\nThe image is clearer than the explanation. I'm sure you will succeed now.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1575727", "name": "Canvas at 09;02;56.png"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 03, 2016 at 12:09AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1574081", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1575726"}
