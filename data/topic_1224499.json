{"body": "\nI'm trying to develop a workflow to quickly assign a \"base\" construction to all walls and windows in a zone and then decompose the zone to assign windows and unique constructions on discrete surfaces. \u00a0\n\nI had thought that the new \"decompose hbzone\" component would help but it seems as if surface attributes (other than geometry) are not passed along as the zone is decomposed. \u00a0I would really appreciate anyone's help in trying to solve this. \u00a0\n\nI'm attaching a gh file that sets an EP zone construction and then decomposes the hbzone. \u00a0When I query the zone attributes, the EP constructions all show \"none\" except for the one that I customized at the surface level.\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1224498", "name": "Decompose_HBZone.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Burin", "created_at": "February 14, 2015 at 3:04pm", "created_by": "Burin", "topic": "decompose hbzone example", "id": "topic_1224499"}
