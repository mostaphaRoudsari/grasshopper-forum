{"body": "\nHi John,\n\n\n\nSome of the surfaces are missing from your model, and I can't recreate the problem.\n\n\n\nIn most cases this issue happens when a surface is not modeled clean and the surface is slightly out of being planer or has duplicated edges and recreating the model should solve the issue.\n\n\n\nAlso why don't you use mass2zone component instead of creating your model surface by surface? That should save you a lot of time and components.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 12, 2016 at 11:13am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1483048", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1482987"}
