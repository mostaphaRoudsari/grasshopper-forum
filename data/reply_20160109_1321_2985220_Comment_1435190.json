{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nI have not used this method but I know from looking at the 'liquidPrecipitationDept' output of the Import EPW component that the vast majority of EPW files do not contain precipitation data and, when they do it is usually inaccurate. \u00a0We have been planning to connect out to a NASA database with better precipitation data for a while now:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/86](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/86)\n\nSince this database is related to a lot of other NASA databases that I am connecting to with Dragonfly, I was thinking of building out a connection to it there. \u00a0I will let you know how this progresses. \u00a0I think that having accurate precipitation values is a necessary pre-step before trying to use this object and, by the time we have that, hopefully that E+ issue that Mostapha posted is addressed.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 09, 2016 at 01:21PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435248", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435190"}
