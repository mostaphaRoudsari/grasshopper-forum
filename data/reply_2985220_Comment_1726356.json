{"body": "\nThe idf file is generated with version 8.2.0. Is this the only version installed on your machine? The error doesn't have to do with the complexity of the model. It's about the EP SimulationControl object. I ran your file with Energyplus 8.6. It takes a long time to run but it runs. EnergyPlus complains that there are so many small faces in the file.
