{"body": "\nHi, I was trying to follow the Honeybee Workshop to learn how to use the components, but I'm getting a error in the \"watch the sky\" component:\n\n\n\nFor some reason the component is having a \"access denied\" to the 'C:\\Users\\tiago_radAnalysis.sky\" (see the attached file). The folder that is shown wasn't created, and the path that it's trying to find is different from the rest of the files (they are all in the path 'C:\\Users\\tiago.xavier.INOVATECH\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\\skylib\\CIESkies\\SAO_PAULO_BRA', as can be seen in the panel in the image).\n\n\n\nDo you have any idea whats wrong?\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1802226", "name": "WatchSky problem.png"}], "created_by_name": "Tiago Xavier Rigobello", "created_at": "August 22, 2017 at 12:58pm", "created_by": "TiagoXavierRigobello", "parent_id": "topic_1274560", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1802224"}
