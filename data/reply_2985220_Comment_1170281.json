{"body": "\nChris,\n\nThank you so much, it works now! I am glad I could be of help.\u00a0\n\nAbout the units you state in the description of the input for the ventilationperarea that normal values range from 0.02 to 0.5 m3/s.m2 That is 20-500 l/s.m2!\n\nI think that what you meant is 0.02\u00a0to 0.5\u00a0l/s.m2. In Sweden the standard for offices is 0.35\u00a0l/s.m2.\u00a0\n\nRegards,\n\nAlejandro\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "November 17, 2014 at 8:36am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1168890", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1170281"}
