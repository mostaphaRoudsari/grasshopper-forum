{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\nTo add to John's post:\n\nI wrote a script to combine all the ILL files (*_0.ill to *_7.ill) into a single file and then tried feeding that as an _illFilesAddress to \"Read Annual Results I\" and as a _resultsFileAddress to \"Read Annual Results II\". It seems to be working fine with the \"Results II\" component. With the \"Results I\" component I get an error stating that the number of data point per line in the ILL file is one less than the number of grid points.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "March 22, 2016 at 3:57pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1490160", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490530"}
