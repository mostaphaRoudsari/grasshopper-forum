{"body": "\nHi Rania,\n\nI think the reason is simple. Your zones are not conditioned. You need to set to true the input in the HB_createHBZones component.\n\nJust need to say that it took forever for GH to respond after the simulation.\n\n\n\nOn another issue, are you aware that the HB_setRADMaterials is receiving input from wrong materials?
