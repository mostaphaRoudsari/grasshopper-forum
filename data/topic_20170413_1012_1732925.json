{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm not new to HB an LB. This used to works previouosly.\n\nI just change my computer an I'm installing HB an LB. For some reason the latest version of OpenStudion 2.1.0 installs itself on the C drive. And HB does not recognized as installed. It seams that HB is looking for OpenStudio in\u00a0C:\\Program Files:\n\nnstalledOPS = [f for f in os.listdir(\"**C:\\\\Program File**s\") if f.startswith(\"OpenStudio\")]\n\nI've try both installation on my C drive and inside\u00a0C:\\Program Files and still HB does not recognize its location. I've also try with version 2.0.5 and I get the same results\n\n\n\nCan anyone point me in the right direction as where and which version of the Open Studio should be installed\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe installation instructions ( [https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/resources/I...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/resources/Installation_Instructions.md)) are not clear about this\n\n\n\nThank you\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "April 13, 2017 at 10:12AM", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "Where OpenStudio should be installes and which version", "id": "topic_1732925"}
