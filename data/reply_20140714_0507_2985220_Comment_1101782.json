{"body": "\nDear Mostapha,<br/><br/>Finally I have found out the problem. Proceeding as you suggest the problem switch to the geometry, that is the real question. In fact working in Radiance I have found some \"bad polygon\" that are composed by a simple line (2 coordinates). Deleting these\u00a0 lines and using this new geometry in the HB .bat file the output results seem to be correct (illuminance values from 600 to 2000 lux).<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0Unfortunately I can not use the original geometry, and then honeybee, since I have a complex geometry and I can not find the famous lines.\n\nI don't know if already exist a control that allows the by pass of wrong geometry (as in my case) and go on with the simulation, but might be interesting create one.<br/><br/>Thanks again,<br/>Giuseppe.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "July 14, 2014 at 05:07AM", "created_by": "GiuseppeDM", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1101723", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1101782"}
