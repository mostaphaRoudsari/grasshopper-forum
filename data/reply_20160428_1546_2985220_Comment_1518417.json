{"body": "\nHello, Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThis component is really helpful. It works well for brep, but when I apply it to surface, the result became weird. I rotated the surface of 180 degree, and the 180 degree result (which is the same location with 0 degree) is way much lower than the first one. It seems like after rotating 90 degrees, the result became inaccurate. Is it related to the norm direction?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1518419", "name": "0degree.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1518420", "name": "180degree.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1518421", "name": "135degree.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Qinheng", "created_at": "April 28, 2016 at 03:46PM", "created_by": "Qinheng", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1461262", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1518417"}
