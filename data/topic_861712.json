{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nwhen working with the component Ladybug_GenCumulativeSky I get a null result and the report \"epwWeatherFile address is not a valid .epw file\" I downloaded the epw file from the Energy Plus website. There are some known issues about this?\n\nI have downloaded the\u00a0GenCumulativeSky.exe file manually. It has to be placed in the workingDir or can stay anywhere? The workingDir should contain all or some of the project files?\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "May 27, 2013 at 4:00pm", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "GenCumulativeSky problems", "id": "topic_861712"}
