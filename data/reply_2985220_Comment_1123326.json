{"body": "\nMaybe it is the meshing going on in the background that makes it slow in Hbee- it can take a long time in DIVA, too, depending on the meshing level; you should be able to put the DIVA output *.rad file into the HBee-generated octree, including whatever materials you assigned in DIVA - if the scene positions line up. Doesn't Hbee even have an \"import rad\" component? Otherwise modify the simulation bat files to feed your D-generated rad into the oct package.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Max D", "created_at": "August 29, 2014 at 5:57am", "created_by": "ButWhyprecisely", "parent_id": "topic_1123312", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1123326"}
