{"body": "\nHi Amaraa,\n\n\n\nGH will not allow recursive relationships, unless you use a few addons available.\n\n\n\nIn this case what I do is to copy/paste the DCtoACderateFactor (I am not on Windows I hope it's the right name) component and input the results from annual shading to the new component further down the workflow. At the end I have 2 of those components in my analysis.\n\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 26, 2016 at 09:29PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535895", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537338"}
