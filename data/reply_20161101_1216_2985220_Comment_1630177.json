{"body": "\nHi Mostapha\n\n\n\nI hope you are doing well! I changed north to 0 and it didn't help. I downloaded daysim from the link provided in your instructions and I think that it is installed correctly (C\\Daysim) please see the attached image. Not sure if it is read by HoneyBee.

Does the file work on your computer?\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1630179", "name": "DAYSIM Location.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 01, 2016 at 12:16PM", "created_by": "LillyGD", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1629975", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1630177"}
