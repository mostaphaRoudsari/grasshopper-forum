{"body": "\ndear mostapha,\u00a0\n\nthank you for the response and you are right\u00a0\n\nit happens every now and then and not for all the simulation\u00a0\n\n\n\nthe reason i suspected that read annual results has anything to do with it, is that it's the cmd dialogue for it which is rubbing while the error message came up\u00a0\n\n\n\nand this is different than the DS_illume error i posted before. so i thought some one have done something similar and i might get some help.\n\n\u00a0\n\nthanks for your continouse patience and concern\u00a0\n\n\n\nregards\u00a0\n\nanas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "anas_hosney", "created_at": "March 25, 2017 at 6:05pm", "created_by": "anashosney", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1720713", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1720843"}
