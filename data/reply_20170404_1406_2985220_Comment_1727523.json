{"body": "\nOk, I was doing that but my problem was my ground was on the same plane as my bottom face and not below the offset. Thank you.\n\nAlso in order to not consider reflections I set changed all the RAD Materials to be 0 reflecting mirrors using the radMirrorMaterial and setRADMaterials components. I did this so I can neglect all reflections in this study. Heres my results below:<br/><br/>[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/t*8vNS4hPCH*nYQE5scCcByyxfuQTzmTZvl8-MRaKy-hcjVuH3cudkLFgZ2W9V-kdVyk8DuimoJAnBsf*Ebmd9G7aBaGohf7/reflections.PNG\" width=\"469\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/t*8vNS4hPCH*nYQE5scCcByyxfuQTzmTZvl8-MRaKy-hcjVuH3cudkLFgZ2W9V-kdVyk8DuimoJAnBsf*Ebmd9G7aBaGohf7/reflections.PNG)What you see in this picture is a large floor, and an inclined cube with a shielding cap on it. All surfaces are supposed to be non reflecting. I get 0 W/m^2 on the top and bottom faces (as expected) However, I get ~2 W/m^2 just above the red patch (expected to be 0) and also ~20 W/m^2 on the two sides opposite of the red patches (expected to be 0). Any ideas what is causing this? There must be some sort of reflection going on - perhaps it is the sky model that is generated? Even though I specified 0 diffuse radiation, maybe reflections from the sun are occuring? This is ok if it is the case, but I would like to read about the sky model being used so I know what assumptions are being made. Thank you Mostapha. This is truly an amazing tool you are developing!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mike Johnson", "created_at": "April 04, 2017 at 02:06PM", "created_by": "MikeJohnson", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1725840", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1727523"}
