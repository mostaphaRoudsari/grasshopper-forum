{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI feel quite confused about my daylight autonomy analysis. Could anyone help me have a look?\u00a0\n\n(PS: I didn't screenshot the results for the first time \u00a0(even color anywhere) and my second simulation is still running.)\n\n\n\nI've attached my file. Thanks in advance.\n\n\n\nMaria\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1480600", "name": "20160309_Dou-1.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1480601", "name": "20160309_Dou-1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Maria X", "created_at": "March 9, 2016 at 7:04pm", "created_by": "MariaX", "topic": "Strange result for my daylight autonomy analysis.", "id": "topic_1480602"}
