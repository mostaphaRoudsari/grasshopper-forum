{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Anders,\n\nBehind the \"innocent\" question there is much more depth than you can imagine.\n\nMostapha is completely right in his warning about the use of radiation vs shading hours. Their intent are different though they are related at the end.\n\nThe big question that you should ask before using any of them (and others) is what do you want to see/get from the analysis. And this is pretty much related to the design. Take for instance the design of a window in building. Probably you'll be more interested in the radiation you can get (or avoid) to perform better, energy wise. But take the case you want to design a playground (or a coffee shop terrace, or any other use you want) for winter time or summer time. Then the sunlight hours analysis is much more important and relevant than the radiation. I can extend in the explanation if you want, but i suppose the issues are clearer now, right?\n\n\n\nI find significant the adjective Anders used to refer to such kind of analysis: He was expecting them to be boring. But now he find the interesting and triggering. This is, in this case, to Mostapha's recognition/right for providing a (simple) tool that designers can use as a part of their workflow: Thumbs up for that Mostapha.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 20, 2013 at 9:28am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_813306", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_813637"}
