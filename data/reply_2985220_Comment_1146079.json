{"body": "\nTom,\n\nIf I had to lay out a step-by-step method:\n\n\n\n1. Build the geometry parametrically in Grasshopper or manually\u00a0in Rhino + bring the geo into GH (as long as you end up with breps in Grasshopper, any geometry creation method is good).\n\n2. Pass the Breps through a createHBSrfs or a Mass2Zone component, which will turn the breps into HBSrfs or HBZones that have Radiance materials assigned to them (note that you can assign glazing based on a ratio to HBZones without windows).\n\n3. Connect the HBSrfs or HBZones up to a Honeybee_Run Daylight Simulation component.\n\n4. Connect an anlysis recipe up to the\u00a0Honeybee_Run Daylight Simulation component, which tells the component what type of radiation/daylight simulation to run.\n\n5. Run the simulation by setting _writeRad and _runRad to \"True\".\n\n6. If the simulation produced something you want to use in GH, import the results back into Grasshopper using one of the Honeybee Daylight \"Read Result\" components (this will vary depending on your simulation).\n\n\n\nAs Mostapha noted, the youtuibe video might be your best way to learn.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 9, 2014 at 12:56pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1145360", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1146079"}
