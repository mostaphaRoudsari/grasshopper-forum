{"body": "\nVery nice Djordje. Thanks!!\n\nA question (or maybe suggestion). The sunpath and terrain resulting from the calculation are (for your example, for instance) too far away. Usually, for representation purposes you want to show the sunpath much closer to your site. So now i take the resulting projection and scale it together with the sunpath.\n\nThe question is: is there a way to control this more user friendly? I have to say that maybe i'm lazy with trying the min/maxVisibilityRadius_ inputs, but this because the computation takes a while :-)\n\n\n\nAlso, it is not clear for me from the explanations: when i already calculated the shading mask how can i save time for the next time. I see that some tif and obj files were downloaded to the ladybug/terrain directory. SO if you don't mind, a further explanation will be appreciated.\n\n\n\nThanks again!!\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 29, 2016 at 12:14AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1557177", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1557238"}
