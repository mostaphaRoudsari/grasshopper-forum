{"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\nI didn't tried much the internal windows, but if they work as the external (and i don't see why they not), you need to give the host surface and the child surface. In this case the host should be the same walls taht you want to be windows and that can't be. Also the size of the child window should not be the same as the host (E+ constrain).\n\nThat's why i think that giving just the name is not good enough.\n\nThough, now that you mention this, a nice trick can be to give the name, the duplicate is and scale it by some amount (less than 0.95) making the whole process transparent for the user. But as long as i write this, sounds a bit complicated (and confusing).\n\nMakes sense for you?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 10, 2015 at 02:22AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1418660", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1418664"}
