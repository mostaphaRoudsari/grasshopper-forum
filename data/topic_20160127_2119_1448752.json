{"body": "\nhi I have uploaded my file. My energy plus simulation file is not running. I got a warning massage that EP component is running only in meters. how can I change the components in meter and how do I know what dimension they are using.I have been trying for a log time to get the energy simulation but it is not working at all. I have updated all the HB and LB component. Can anybody please help me to figure out the problem. Thanks.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UjLFZWxAkgpWUqCCxdAqosHsmQseGnCCdTl4tywZm6NHmOucwBMrtAR-x20ayxgxXyo5xNwwsUGqN5OQx41rPXuqZrkV7HC1/Capture9.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UjLFZWxAkgpWUqCCxdAqosHsmQseGnCCdTl4tywZm6NHmOucwBMrtAR-x20ayxgxXyo5xNwwsUGqN5OQx41rPXuqZrkV7HC1/Capture9.PNG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1448751", "name": "6 - Running a Basic Energy Simulation by krk.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Khandaker Rasel Kabir", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 09:19PM", "created_by": "KhandakerRaselKabir", "topic": "waringi msg:1.
