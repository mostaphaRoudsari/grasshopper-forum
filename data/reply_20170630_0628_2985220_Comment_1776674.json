{"body": "Tristan and Federico,\n\nThis is a very good question and I have had a few people ask me about this now. The capability does not currently exist but I have had this on my to-do list for a while with these github issues:\nhttps://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/issues/575\n\nhttps://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/issues/624\n\nI'll aim to have this implemented by the next stable release, which is in a couple of weeks. The way that I plan to implement it is through the dumpHBObjects and loadHBObjects components that are currently in WIP. This will allow you to write both HBObjects like zones and surfaces to a file as well as the view factor Info. So you can store them in these external files and load them up later or in other GH definitions where you want to visualize different results (or run different microclimate map studies).\n\nI'll post back here once it is implemented.\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 30, 2017 at 06:28AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1776336", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1776674"}
