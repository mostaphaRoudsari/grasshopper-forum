{"body": "\nHi Ander,\n\nI can't check your file right now but this is probably happening because you are using some components with a newer version than Honeybee_Honeybee in your file. If you update all the components with the latest version you won't get this issue. You can download the new userObjects from Github.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 21, 2014 at 12:21pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1104373", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1104548"}
