{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nHave 2 questions -- one for hot-water calcs and one for heat-recovery systems -- that I want to verify before running 100's of simulations in GH for an academic project. I've skimmed the discussion board but have not found quick answers so am throwing it out here.\n\nHOT WATER\n\nJust wanted to verify that when setting equipment loads around the 4-6 watt/m range for a single-family home, that this number WOULD NOT include hot-water heating, even from an electric hot-water heater with a high COP. As such, to calculate hot-water heating loads then one would need to use the Ladybug Residential Hot Water component.\n\nHEAT-RECOVERY\n\nI also wanted to get feedback on setting up heat-recovery systems for HVAC. I'm using ideal-air loads with the open-studio component so that I can quickly toggle between systems with and without heat-recovery systems. That said, the results with and without a system are only about 1% different. This seems very small to me, especially given the context is Abu Dhabi. Any help would be great. I would attach the file but it is super complex and within a cluster. My set-up though is:\n\nHVAC Air Details with only heatRecovery_ and recoveryEffectiveness set, passed into Assign HVAC System component which has _coolingDetails inputted from HVAC Cooling details but I assume the COP, etc. get's overridden when we are using Ideal Air Loads.\n\n\n\nAny help or verification of these results would be very, very helpful.\n\n\n\nThanks guys,\n\nDavid\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Birge", "created_at": "June 09, 2017 at 10:33AM", "created_by": "DavidBirge", "topic": "hot-water + heat-recovery questions", "id": "topic_1766864"}
