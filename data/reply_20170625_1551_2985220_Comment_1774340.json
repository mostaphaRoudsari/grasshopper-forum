{"body": "\nMhhhh and if i wanted to simulate this kind construction in THERM; what would be the material of choice?\n\nWhen I input the default air space resistance of honeybee i recieve the warning, that it has a conductivity of 0. Where it schould be something around 0.025 or 0.076921 according to this thread:\u00a0\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/therm-examp...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/therm-example?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1429638&amp;xg_source=msg_com_gr_forum)\n\nBut the custom made THERM material doesnt seem to be the right one either because as far as I understand it is only useful for windows constructions while setting the cavity model?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Gzb*D4mTQDX5s2*FUI*-N6yuzlMLj6X*jt1wDu19Ay6oWWQn5gPFjGQ2jtCB7*gOn59JTSyPUJtVHJ4SvR5NlHp0VENrYd0Z/Therm.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Gzb*D4mTQDX5s2*FUI*-N6yuzlMLj6X*jt1wDu19Ay6oWWQn5gPFjGQ2jtCB7*gOn59JTSyPUJtVHJ4SvR5NlHp0VENrYd0Z/Therm.PNG)\n\nIs there some way to set up a material for a ventilated air space as part of a rear ventilated facade?\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nDominik\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dominik Simon", "created_at": "June 25, 2017 at 03:51PM", "created_by": "DominikSimon", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1774169", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1774340"}
