{"body": "\nHi Charlene,\n\n\n\nFirst up, regardless of what manufacturers might state, approximating tubular daylighting devices with IES files is not a physically realistic solution.\u00a0 The wide variation in Daylight on account of the position of the sun and weather cannot be expressed in terms of a single set of luminous intensity values (which is what IES files do).\n\nWith regards to your example files, I agree with Chris. The primary reason for the low illuminance levels is that the light bounces are getting lost in the tube. **Have you checked with the manufacturer/distributor if the location of the IES file should be inside the tube and not flush with the ceiling?** Physically modelling such tubes in lighting software like Radiance (which is what HB uses) or AGI32 is a fairly expensive proposition. This is one of the reasons why manufacturers provide photometric data for such devices (however simplistic that data might be).\n\nThe candelamultiplier increases or decreases the luminous intensity values. So it will have a direct impact on the calculation.\u00a0 The primary reason for having that input was to enable users to do some testing with different lamp types and environmental factors such as dirt depreciation. You need not change them for your simulation. Assuming that the IES file is inside the tube, in order to make this calculation work inside HB you'd have to crank up the calculation settings to a very high level (start with -ab 10 -ad 4096).\n\n\n\nFinally, due to shortcomings in the annual simulation software (Daysim), IES files will not work directly work with annual calculations. However, there is a fairly easy workaround for that issue. In case you are planning to run annual calculations with IES files, please let us know here.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "January 12, 2017 at 10:07am", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1670547", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1670857"}
