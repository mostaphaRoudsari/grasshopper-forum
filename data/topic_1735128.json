Older versions of GHpython gave the same results.\u00a0\n\nAny ideas?\u00a0\n\nThanks :)\u00a0\n\n\n\n........................................................\n\nOriginal discussion 18.4.17\n\nHi all,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI installed Ladybug as it is explained in this link (\u00a0[http://james-ramsden.com/installing-honeybee-for-grasshopper/](http://james-ramsden.com/installing-honeybee-for-grasshopper/) ) but when I use any component, from Ladybug or Honeybee tool, Rhino crashes!\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have Win10-64 bit, Rhino 5, GH 0.9.0069. and I installed:<br/> 1.
