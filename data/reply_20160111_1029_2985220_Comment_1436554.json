{"body": "\nHi, Mostapha,\n\nIt works! I will save your codes to somewhere safe! Thanks a lot!\n\nAnd I have some other question regarding simulation results.\n\nI am running the simulation through both EnergyPlus and Openstudio components with exact same input, but the outcome is a little bit different. Is this normal?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bgiO77bkViAV6kO-su4GC5U0SaWJTk1LVzipigHQYcrMJ*GSChL7dp7dyKg7VNPn7*Per24laGOk4WrgkzxN3MAjKHlHwnUF/Capture.JPG\" width=\"578\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bgiO77bkViAV6kO-su4GC5U0SaWJTk1LVzipigHQYcrMJ*GSChL7dp7dyKg7VNPn7*Per24laGOk4WrgkzxN3MAjKHlHwnUF/Capture.JPG)\n\n\n\nAnd, after I update the input HBZones with modified lighting schedule generated by Daysim, the electric lighting consumption from Openstudio Component turns to \"0\". EnergyPlus Component seems working correctly. Any thoughts?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bgiO77bkViDu4O2VNZoXh4*skKLblkXXebxS2*UIRBh2*T4WmiOcCdf-kEEArHN3qBayRMEgoryCoytTITt0iqGE5gZ4Psyo/Capture2.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bgiO77bkViDu4O2VNZoXh4*skKLblkXXebxS2*UIRBh2*T4WmiOcCdf-kEEArHN3qBayRMEgoryCoytTITt0iqGE5gZ4Psyo/Capture2.JPG)\n\n\n\nThank you again!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zilong Tan", "created_at": "January 11, 2016 at 10:29AM", "created_by": "ZilongTan", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435403", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1436554"}
