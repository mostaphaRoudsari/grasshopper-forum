{"body": "\nHi Mostapha\n\nIs there anyway to get all the results without having to bake them? I know its possible to use totalSunlightHours to see the results but the analysisMesh only has a single geometric output. It would simplify workflow if you didn't need to bake it to see all the results. It would also be cool to get a list of the rotations as an output rather than having to calculate them separately.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul Wintour", "created_at": "August 23, 2015 at 1:39am", "created_by": "PaulWintour", "parent_id": "topic_792125", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1347207"}
