{"body": "\nHi Colin,\n\nThank you for the clean file and the clear description. The reason you get this error instead of a\u00a0meaningful error is because I don't log the errors for the init file which I should have. I will add that.\n\nBut the main error comes from the\u00a0illegal vertical size of the image in fish-eye viewport. Let me check the details and get back to you. Looks like you're doing everything right.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 16, 2016 at 9:13pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1618614", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619861"}
