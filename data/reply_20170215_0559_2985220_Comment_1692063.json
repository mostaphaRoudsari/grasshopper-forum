{"body": "\nHi Antonello,\n\nThanks for your explaination.\n\nActually, I put the two images just to show the errors of the remapped one.\n\nTo be more clear, what i meant is to create a map with treshold colors like:\n\nfor the DF\u00a0below 0.7 --&gt; red\n\nfor the DF between\u00a00.7 -\u00a02.2 --&gt; orange\n\nfor the DF between\u00a02.2 -\u00a03.6 --&gt; yellow\n\nfor the DF between\u00a03.6 -\u00a05.4 --&gt; green\n\nfor the DF up to 5.4 --&gt; white\n\nSo in my mind the maps should have white colors next to the glazing system, then green, then yellow and so on. But as you can see from the one i have done, a part from the red colors, the others are not congruent with the real DF in the second image. \u00a0\n\nI would like just to know what is wrong in the workflow, if the functions or the meshes ...\n\nThanks\n\nClaudia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "February 15, 2017 at 05:59AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1691972", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1692063"}
