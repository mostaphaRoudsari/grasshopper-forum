{"body": "\nRauland,\n\nWe cannot always guarantee that the newer ladybug/honeybee components will be backwards compatible. \u00a0Whenever you update the user objects in your Ladybug toolbar and then go to edit a GH file that has older components, you will likely encounter errors. \u00a0You can try to update all of the components on your GH canvass to the gituhub version by using the updateThisFile input on the \"Update Ladybug\" components but this will not work for components where the inputs or outputs have changed between the new/old version. \u00a0So, for these types of components, you need to insert them manually. \u00a0This was the case with your sunpath and I have manually replaced it with an up-to-date version in the attached file.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1360298", "name": "environmental_sunpath_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 12, 2015 at 11:26AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1345671", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1360297"}
