{"body": "\nHi Mustopha and all,\n\n\n\nFirstly, i want to say thank you to Musthopa for this application. i tried to run energy plus with honeybee. I have opened/attached weather file (epw file). Then, i set write idf to yes and idf file was written successfully. However, after i set run energy plus to yes,\u00a0the result message said that no weather file was attached. How to solve this problem? what step have i missed?\u00a0\n\nThank you...\n\natika\n\n\n\n\n\n<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/p5H7N8Ot6oORKBnO*uJ187B2glMXGDflZ5NETE8LSnD3COxaJI3-Sy3EuG01LO2KFt9qUf0uvo1IjkWcWpUPlQABn8VHtsin/writeidf.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/p5H7N8Ot6oNuyusa9U3RAqsMZEAA798LdQu50acGjWIO76*u07VMU-3aI5QKh57V5orpExSE-5tVX56xI1WV8RdsHmvP67nd/Picture1.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/p5H7N8Ot6oNuyusa9U3RAqsMZEAA798LdQu50acGjWIO76*u07VMU-3aI5QKh57V5orpExSE-5tVX56xI1WV8RdsHmvP67nd/Picture1.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "atika nur fitriana", "created_at": "June 16, 2014 at 08:38PM", "created_by": "atikanurfitriana", "topic": "No weather file attached Issue in honeybee (E+)", "id": "topic_1089161"}
