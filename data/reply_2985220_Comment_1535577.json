{"body": "\nDjordje,\n\n\n\nThanks for all of the knowledge you have shared. \u00a0If what you say is correct about the small difference between the global horizontal and direct/diffuse calculations in the MENEX model, than the discrepancy likely has more to do with the difference between the approximation of human geometry in the MENEX model (plane or cylinder) and the human geometry approximation in the SolarCal model (some coefficients derived from radiation studies of mannequins). \u00a0I noticed some fairly large differences between using a suggested global horizontal method and a direct/diffuse method with the SolarCal model (differences on the order of 20%) but I imagine that this is because a mannequin human geometry is more sensitive to changes in solar orientation than a cylinder or plane. \u00a0All of this is very good to know.\n\n\n\nAm I correct in understanding that you recently corrected the grey-body assumption about sky temperature in the Thermal Comfort Indices component with this commit?\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/a2a37b6dccc4e750...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/a2a37b6dccc4e750738237212c8e92d1945f4161#diff-163718ba0eb0fcfd1ffc7969808f01eeR842)\n\nI have tried to check whether the formulas match between the literature you posted and your new code and they seem to. \u00a0If you could confirm this, I will make the same change to the solar-adjusted temp component and the comfort maps.\n\n\n\nThanks again for all of the knowledge!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 23, 2016 at 4:53pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1534649", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535577"}
