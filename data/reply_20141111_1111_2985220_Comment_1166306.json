{"body": "\nAlejandro,\n\nI am pretty sure that I know what is happening. \u00a0If you run EnergyPlus while you have the csv result file open in another program (in excel, for example), EnergyPlus is unable to overwrite the original csv file and so it dumps all results into an eplusout.csv file that is makes next to the open one. \u00a0Unfortunately, the write IDF component isn't smart enough to recognize when this happens right now and so it just spits out the file address of the old file.\n\nTo fix the problem, go to the folder with the csv result file in it, delete everything in that folder, and re-run the Write IDF component. \u00a0This time, the file loaded into Grasshopper should have the correct results in it.\n\nAs for the heat recovery, the percentage of ventilation seems like an ok means to get an initial estimate of potential heat recovery savings. \u00a0The savings that you will get this way will probably be a bit on the optimistic side and you really should model out the full system at some point. \u00a0Also, 75% seems like a really high efficiency and I imagine that you might need a big Delta T between inside and outside air to get such good heat transfer. \u00a0This might not always be the case for your building throughout the year.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 11, 2014 at 11:11AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1166324", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1166306"}
