{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI am designing a folded double fa\u00e7ade and I am trying to model it in honeybee for energy simulations. For now I started with just one zone representing the double fa\u00e7ade cavity (without any openings yet), but energy plus generates this error:\n\nProgram Version,EnergyPlus-Windows-64 8.1.0.009, YMD=2015.04.30 15:22,IDD_Version 8.1.0.009\n\nI ran the same model before using Archsim as I needed the airflow network model, but now I am trying to build it up in honeybee to export it to Design builder to use its CFD simulations. I assumed since the model worked in Archsim then it would work normally in honeybee.\n\nI tried a simpler folded fa\u00e7ade and it worked, so is the problem related to the big number of faces? Or am I missing something?\n\nI attached the gh file and the idf file in case someone could take a look.\n\nThank you!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1277714", "name": "HB folded facade.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1277715", "name": "folded_facade.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1277716", "name": "HB pinwheel folded facade inquiry.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Salma El Ahmar", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 08:26AM", "created_by": "SalmaElAhmar", "topic": "Folded double facade", "id": "topic_1277717"}
