{"body": "\nJulia,\n\nThanks so much for finding the bug. \u00a0This is going to be much easier to fix than the last one that you reported. \u00a0It also seems to be the same bug that another user reported to me here:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/read-ep-res...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/read-ep-result-formatting-issue?xg_source=activity)\n\n\n\nI will take a look at your files shortly. \u00a0In the meantime, if you could also upload the GH file that created the error, that would be helpful. \u00a0It is ok of the file is large as I mostly know what I am looking for.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 30, 2016 at 6:28pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1591117", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1591241"}
