{"body": "\nHi Antonello,\u00a0\n\n\n\nSomehow I could not reply your latest post (with \"[LB sunrise_sunset.gh](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1520561)\" attached).\n\n\n\nThe \"isSunUpshit_\" filter is awesome! I also like the idea of \"IsSunUp\" output. I am still a GH newbie, but why not using \"IsSunUp\" output to filter out your 8760hrs \"sun vector\" output and eventually feed LB \"sun path\"? You have all the necessary output to do such calculation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am also thinking, in addition to\u00a0\"isSunUpshit_\", an additional filter which could respect solar altitude will also be very helpful. What do you think? purely relying on a fixed hours before/after sunset/sunrise might be rigid.\n\nRegards,\u00a0\n\nCheney\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Cheney", "created_at": "May 2, 2016 at 10:32am", "created_by": "Cheney", "parent_id": "topic_1452037", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1520765"}
