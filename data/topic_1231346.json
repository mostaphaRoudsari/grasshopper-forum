{"body": "\nHey everyone,\n\n\n\nFirst of all I would like to apologize for my flooding of these forums. I hope it isn't getting annoying. I tend to get into things passionately and of course I stumble a lot.\n\nI am trying to look around in the forums before posting, as much as possible.\n\n\n\nI have a very simple question about the (extremely) annoying part of transforming an Architectural model into an EnergyPlus model.\n\nIn Arch models, zones are not an issue and so not really defined. For example, usually floor and roof slabs cover the whole expanse of the house/appartment/office/etc.\n\n\n\nThis requires a lot of manual work of cutting the floor/roof surfaces into the pieces of the individual zones, a task I am already doing for the interior walls. I was wondering, and I hope this isn't a silly question, if it is possible to use the same, one, roof/floor slab for all the zones without having to cut it into pieces. Is there a way, like the solve adjacencies perhaps, to automatically cut the floor/roof and assign the proper portions to the zones?\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 24, 2015 at 10:23pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Rhino models to Energy Plus models", "id": "topic_1231346"}
