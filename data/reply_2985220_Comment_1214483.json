{"body": "\nHi Chris!\n\n\n\nThank you for the quick reply! And thanks for solving the problem for me.\n\n\n\nI am quite okay with the concepts that are discussed and used in the tools but I am quite horrible in 3d modelling. I am going through your honeybee videos now, hoping there are a few tips on constructing the actual models :)\n\nI will try the above solution, I'm sure it will work as a charm. The tool is actually really interesting, as are most of the other tools I don't even know about yet.\n\nI'm lucky enough to be involved in a big project that actually gives priority to environmental analyses assessments to inform design (this is very very rare in my experience). That's why I am even luckier to be able to use these open source tools.\n\n\n\nWill be back with much more self-created problems in the future I'm sure!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 30, 2015 at 11:37pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1214285", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1214483"}
