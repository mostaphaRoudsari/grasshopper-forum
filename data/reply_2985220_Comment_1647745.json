{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\n\n\nI tried the file that you sent. Importidf works and EnergyPlus file runs and i can see the model in Rhino. However, the simulation fails because of sever errors. The main issue, I think, is that I only see Open Brep rather than Closed Breps. Please let me know if that is because of the fact that the idf file generated by GBS was not clear enough. I want to make sure that I am doing everything right, before making a conclusion here.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks again\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1647746", "name": "HB-Importidf errors.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1647747", "name": "Clear.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1647748", "name": "importIdf_2_FromMostapha.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 28, 2016 at 2:00pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1641495", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647745"}
