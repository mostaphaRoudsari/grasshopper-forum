{"body": "\nOn a slightly separate note:\n\nI believe the GH file I posted produces annual lux-hour values and it allows you to visualize results with colored grids. My actual file is more complex and I think visualizing results in this manner will help understand what kinds of design choices would limit lux-hours in the most exposed areas. The issue I have is that I can't visualize all the results at once, but rather I have to cycle through the analyzed surfaces (only two surfaces in the example).\n\n\n\nCan anyone point me towards a solution that would allow me to visualize any number of analysis surfaces at once?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ernst Bay", "created_at": "May 25, 2017 at 6:35am", "created_by": "ErnstBay", "parent_id": "topic_1757076", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1757824"}
