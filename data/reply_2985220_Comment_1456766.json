{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply. LB+HB are absolutely great tools but somehow I am not able to use them as I keep on getting strange errors. Like for grid based simulation, I was using your example file and upon running the simulation I got an error stating solution exception:out of range 0. Now since I am not from a coding background I am not able to understand the problem and hence not being able to use. I also looked on the forum but could not find an answer that solves my problem.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRam\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ram Joshi", "created_at": "February 7, 2016 at 7:35am", "created_by": "RamJoshi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455885", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1456766"}
