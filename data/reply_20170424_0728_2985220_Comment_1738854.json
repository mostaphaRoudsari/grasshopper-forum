{"body": "\nmy bad if i stripped down the geometry to the necessary minimum, so not to upload GBs of useless geometry. In short, the plane is a floor which i am interested to see the light ray hit after bouncing off the reflector geometry. And no the context is not ONLY the plan, but also the sticks that are masking the reflective surface. Working in meters is fine\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe problem appears when you zoom in o the reflector geometry, the rays behave really weird (as in the photo), and bounce off also the opaque sticks even though they are specified as opaque material.\n\nGabriella\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Gabriella Rossi", "created_at": "April 24, 2017 at 07:28AM", "created_by": "GabriellaRossi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1737619", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1738854"}
