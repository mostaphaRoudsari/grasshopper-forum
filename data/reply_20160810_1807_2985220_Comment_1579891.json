{"body": "\nHi Mona,\n\n\n\nAssuming that your IES file is appropriate, I think the only issue with your file is that points are below the ground. It should run fine otherwise. I did a random test with your file and it turned out okay for me....\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7pKesekhE53gDzL1DqEVWe03BxVhh1vsNpsWLku3kUYp*l2wZVMErTKz0U8wS0tX8pNVtq4TugzPmg2ekaJZqO2ZNGi8tCd2/810201645846PM.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/7pKesekhE53gDzL1DqEVWe03BxVhh1vsNpsWLku3kUYp*l2wZVMErTKz0U8wS0tX8pNVtq4TugzPmg2ekaJZqO2ZNGi8tCd2/810201645846PM.png)The IES file that I used is attached. Lithonia Lighting has a vast collection of IES files. [http://www.lithonia.com/photometrics.aspx?Fid=75036](http://www.lithonia.com/photometrics.aspx?Fid=75036)\n\nTrilux ([https://www.trilux.com/en/](https://www.trilux.com/en/)) also has a good collection of IES files. Actually, nowadays every lighting manufacturer has IES files on their website.\n\nI noticed that you are using slightly older version of the components. Chris Mackey has made several improvements to these components over the past month. So, you might be better of using the newer versions of these.\n\n<br/>I don't have proper access to Rhino or Gh right now so in case you have further queries I might be able to answer them only by the end of this week..\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1579892", "name": "RT5_2x2Recessed.ies"}], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "August 10, 2016 at 06:07PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579936", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579891"}
