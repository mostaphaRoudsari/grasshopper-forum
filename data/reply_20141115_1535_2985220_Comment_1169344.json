{"body": "\nKristoffer,\n\nMostapha's response is absolutely correct and, if you want more info about how Honeybee is meshing the sphere in order to be able to run it through E+, you should check out this video that gaives a full explanation:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMQ2Pau4q6c&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMQ2Pau4q6c&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=12)\n\nThe simulation will run much faster if you can find a good way to planarize your geometry first since the default meshing algorithms can create a lot of surfaces, which really slows the calculation down.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 15, 2014 at 03:35PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1169513", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1169344"}
