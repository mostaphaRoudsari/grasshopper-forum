{"body": "\nHi Abraham and Maryam,\n\nTo get results in surface level you need to use a different component (readEPSurfaceResults).

I will check it in 2015! ;) Thanks for reporting ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/239](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/239)).\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1197092", "name": "MySimulation_AY_MSR.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 31, 2014 at 12:44pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1197334", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1197090"}
