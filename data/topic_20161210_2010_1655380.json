{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI was trying to run the basic energy simulation for the example you shared in your tutorial videos and it was giving me the following errors:\n\n1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> ** Severe ** Problem in interior solar distribution calculation (CHKBKS)\n\n2. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> ** Severe ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 2 surfaces which are casting surfaces and are non-convex.\n\nRecently I updated HB and LB, and I have never seen these errors when I tried the former version.\n\nI tried to breakup all the zones in each floor with air walls, however, it seems dosen't work. <br/>I would be appreciate for any suggestions to solve this problem.\n\nThank you,\n\nRoy\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1655379", "name": "Running a basic simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Yi LUO", "created_at": "December 10, 2016 at 08:10PM", "created_by": "YiLUO", "topic": "EnergyPlus simulation errors about  solar distribution calculation and non-convex zones", "id": "topic_1655380"}
