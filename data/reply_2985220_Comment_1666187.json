{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nhappy new year and thanks for the new suggestion.\n\nWe have finally updated the script. We splitted the heating and cooling calculations in order to set independent internal loads (0 loads for heating period). Schedules seem to work fine.\n\nWe got results we compared with other commercial software for validation (mc4, IES with ASHRAE method and IES with CIBSE method) and:\n\n- cooling loads are comparable - OK!\n\n- heating loads are not comparable - it seems they are 2-3 times more than the other results.\n\n\n\nWe modeled the same geometry and the same properties in all softwares.\n\nCould you please have a look of the file attached? The model is very easy and I didn't expect to have all these issues.\n\nSorry for continuing asking for your support, but this step is very important for my research.\n\n\n\nThank you again,\n\nRiccardo\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1666188", "name": "Thermalloads_FORUM2ter.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1666189", "name": "load comparation.xlsx"}], "created_by_name": "Riccardo Diaferia", "created_at": "January 3, 2017 at 3:42am", "created_by": "RiccardoDiaferia49", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1660751", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1666187"}
