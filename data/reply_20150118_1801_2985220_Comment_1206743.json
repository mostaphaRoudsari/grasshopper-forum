{"body": "Hi Michalina and Michal,\n\nThank you for your nice comments. You are right on. Jan. 13th around 3am is the birthday of Ladybug and I should have sent a post for that but things went pretty busy.\n\nFYI I was in RhinoDay last week and showed Michalina's study on Honeybee's and her comment on Honeybee not being yellow. :)\n\nThanks again for your support and sorry for the later reply. :)", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 18, 2015 at 06:01PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1203541", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1206743"}
