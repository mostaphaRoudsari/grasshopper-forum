{"body": "\nFrancesco,\n\nThe adaptive comfort model calculates the running mean outdoor temperature as a weighted average of the previous week's temperature. \u00a0The notion is that people adapt themselves based on what they have recently experienced and that it typically takes about a week for people to fully adapt to a new outdoor thermal condition. \u00a0This is why you need to provide more that just an outdoor temperature for the range that you are interested in to get the adaptive chart to work correctly. \u00a0In your case, it might be worth it to just stitch in some data before and after your recording period to get this to work. \u00a0Just be wary that the first week of your recording period will be using the stitched data of the previous week to determine comfortable conditions.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 4, 2017 at 11:51pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1793604", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1793994"}
