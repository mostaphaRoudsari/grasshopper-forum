{"body": "\nThanks, the runItAll attachment work great.\n\n\n\nThe issue with the file structure is that if i want to give each image a unique name based on Hour Month and Year (passed to the _RadFile_Name_), then it produces the result here (first screen shot). One folder per image.\u00a0 I get the timestamp i want, but have to automate a process for grabbing all the images and putting them in one folder.\n\n\n\nBut if i disconnect the \"Concat\" component, then i get a folder with sequential images (which is what i am after), but no time stamps on the image file names.\n\n\n\nSince i know these are going to be hourly, its not really a problem, but it would be nice for archival purposes to have the time stamp (for time of year) in the file name.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1120624", "name": "Screen Shot 2014-08-23 at 9.30.34 PM.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1120625", "name": "Screen Shot 2014-08-23 at 9.49.56 PM.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1120626", "name": "Screen Shot 2014-08-23 at 9.43.49 PM.png"}], "created_by_name": "Octagon26", "created_at": "August 23, 2014 at 10:54pm", "created_by": "Octagon26", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1120430", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1120623"}
