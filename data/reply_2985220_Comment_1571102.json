{"body": "\nArpan,\n\n\n\nI can tell you that most important assumptions about systems 1-10 are contained within Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1 (particulary around\u00a0table G3.1.1). \u00a0This includes all assumptions about supply temperatures, COPs, economizer controls, etc. \u00a0Anything that is not specified in Appendix G (like the size of the HVAC components) is auto-sized by default in OpenStudio/E+, using the ddy file and your HBzones.\n\n\n\nYou can [buy Appendix G from here](https://www.ashrae.org/resources--publications/bookstore/standard-90-1-appendix-g-2013-performance-rating-method)\u00a0but I have personally learned much more about the systems just by opening .osm files in OpenStudio and browsing through the systems in the interface. \u00a0The OpenStudio interface is really clean and organized such that I have had a much easier time understanding systems there than in other software interfaces or in complete HVAC drawings for buildings. You want to look at the\u00a0'HVAC System' tab and in the 'Thermal Zones' tab to get a full understanding of the system components using this method.\n\n\n\nIf you could be more specific about which assumptions you are trying to understand, I might be able to point you to some better resources.\n\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 25, 2016 at 6:35pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1570876", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1571102"}
