{"body": "\nHi Djordje,\n\n\n\nThank you for your answer. So, if I purchase the 2012 historical year file, it contains average weather data from the las 12 years, would this be enough?\n\nAnother option White Box Technologies gives is generating a composite-year historical weather data files, which is to compose a single file joining multiple periods through switchover dates (i.e. from 1/1/2001 to 5/15/2001 with 5/16/2004 to 12/31/2004), which seems to be a good option when no complete years are available. However in my case, as all years are complete do you think composing a month by month file through the 12 year available\u00a0period (using a month from each year consecutively) could be a better option?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland D.
