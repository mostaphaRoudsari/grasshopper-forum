{"body": "\nWow, thank you Chris for your lightening reply. So I must do something wrong at my side. I notice you actually rotate the model in Rhino. What I did was to assign 180 number to \u00a0\"_north\" at GH. Do the two methods generate different results? Anyway, I will double check my model next monday and report back to you if I still have questions. Thanks a lot and have a nice weekend!
