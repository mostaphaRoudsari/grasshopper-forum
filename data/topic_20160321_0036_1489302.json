{"body": "\nHi Mostapha et al\n\n\n\nI need to do a view analysis from a floorplate to a specific building but am having some issues.\n\n\n\nGeometry - I have offset the finished floor surface 1650mm to be at eye level.\n\nContext - I have a mesh of the geometry to analysis. This is a city model.\n\nView points - These are the vertices of the Sydney Harbour Bridge mesh.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe problem is that I cannot use a surface as the input to '_geometry'. What I need is to have a surface which isn't self-occluding. If I extrude the surface to create a brep, the top surface will be coloured accurately, while the the bottom surface will be blocked and all shown 0. Controlling the normal of the surface and meshing it doesn't work because sometimes the view points will be above and other times below. Basically the '_geometry' isn't really geometry but a series of eye positions. Is that clear?\n\n\n\nAny ideas how to solve? View type doesn't really help because I want to focus on just one building (Sydney Harbour Bridge) rather than the entire city context geometry.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul Wintour", "created_at": "March 21, 2016 at 12:36AM", "created_by": "PaulWintour", "topic": "View analysis without self-occluding geometry", "id": "topic_1489302"}
