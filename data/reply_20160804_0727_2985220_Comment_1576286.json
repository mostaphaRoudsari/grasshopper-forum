{"body": "\nArpan,\n\nThey are good questions.\n\nYes, the\u00a0\"Update Honyebee\" or \"Update Ladybug\" components automatically sync your components with the fixed versions on the github if you are connected to the internet.\n\nIf you use the _updateAllUObjects option on the \"Update Honyebee\" or \"Update Ladybug\" components, this updates all components in your Ladybug/Honeybee toolbar and when you drag/drop the new component on the canvass.\n\nIf you use the updateThisFile_ option on the \"Update Honyebee\" or \"Update Ladybug\" components, you can update your whole GH file to the same version at once but be warned that it does not work for all components. \u00a0In the case that we have changed the names of the inputs/outputs or added inputs/outputs, you will have to replace the component manually (dragging them onto the canvass as it sounds like you did here).\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 04, 2016 at 07:27AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1576436", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1576286"}
