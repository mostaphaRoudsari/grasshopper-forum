{"body": "\nHi Cheney,\n\n\n\nCurrently Honeybee is using Daysim which unless you have only a single window in your room, or all the blinds go up and down together can't model blind operations as suggested by IES LEM-83-12. Sarith is implementing Radiance's 3-5 phase methods to Honeybee which will make the process possible.\n\n\n\nYour best bet at this point is OpenStudio and using RadianceDaylight measure. Honeybee let's you to export the model as osm and then you can use OpenStudio for the rest.\n\n\n\nWe also have an experimental workflow under development that let's you run OpenStudio measures form inside Honeybee but it won't work for daylighting measure for some OpenStudio limitations that you can read [here](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/290)\u00a0and [here](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/402).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 30, 2016 at 5:27pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519497", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519604"}
