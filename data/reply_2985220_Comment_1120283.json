{"body": "\nHi Dimitris,\n\nThis is a light leakage which is common if parameters are set lower than what it needs to be. Honeybee by default checks the inputs for parameters and set them to an acceptable minimum but looks like it wasn't enough for this case. I used a higher quality [1] for radParameters and the results looks fine.\n\nIn the current version the parameters are set based on meter units. What was the units in your document?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k597Gy8eW*XZTz2nt2KFLrW57WGS1HNZ16xh2esTatxoNJSuUMk9lQev2WOwQ877xkxKksqFtKLv4upajZyz4EXPnxKwkcbW/DF_Perspective.png\" width=\"621\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k597Gy8eW*XZTz2nt2KFLrW57WGS1HNZ16xh2esTatxoNJSuUMk9lQev2WOwQ877xkxKksqFtKLv4upajZyz4EXPnxKwkcbW/DF_Perspective.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 23, 2014 at 10:18am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1120179", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1120283"}
