{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\n\n\nThank you for sharing the links. Similar approach can be applied to Honeybee however it is not currently implemented. I personally don't want to implement lighting simulation to Honeybee at this point. So much can go wrong there for inexperienced users.\n\n\n\nI saw your discussion on DIVA page and I'm pretty sure Alstan will have a solution for that. Keep me posted about the results. If you really need it for your studies I can apply it to Honeybee over the next weekend.\n\n\n\nTuan's work is also pretty interesting. Thanks for sharing. I wish I could read more details about his project.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 13, 2014 at 4:24pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1043489", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1043501"}
