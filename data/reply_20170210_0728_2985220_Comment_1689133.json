{"body": "\nHi Omid,\u00a0\n\nThank you for your reply. I opened the files you sent. It is working for me as well. So, there must be something wrong with my definition.\n\nOnly thing that went wrong was the error message that I got for false toggle component. I don't know why. Ghpython component is up to date, the file is not blocked and I am using 0.63 version of ladybug. The error I got is \"the user object could not be created as the base type is missing\"\u00a0\n\nBest,\n\nMustafa\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mustafa Teksoy", "created_at": "February 10, 2017 at 07:28AM", "created_by": "MustafaTeksoy", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1688899", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1689133"}
