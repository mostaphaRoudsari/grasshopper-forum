{"body": "\nI could not find any discussions on this topic. Harmful light exposure to museum objects is often measured in lux hours (visible light is used also\u00a0as a proxy for UV). I do not think this is something that can be generated out of the box with Honeybee. I created the attached solution, which works ok when there are a small number of surfaces to be analyzed, but it would be tedious to analyze a larger number of surfaces because I do not know how to visualize them all at once.\n\n\n\nI would appreciate any suggestions regarding my solution, comments on lux hours and sensitive museum objects, and - I obviously think this would be a great added tool in Honeybee.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n(Obviously, I need to learn Python.)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1757075", "name": "Lux_hours.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ernst Bay", "created_at": "May 24, 2017 at 01:33PM", "created_by": "ErnstBay", "topic": "Light Exposure - Lux Hours", "id": "topic_1757076"}
