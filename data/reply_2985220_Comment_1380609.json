{"body": "\nAntonio,\n\n\n\nI do not know what the degenerate surface error from EnergyPlus means but I know that you should be able to find out either by searching for the error through the EnergyPlus documentation:\n\n[http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/input-output-reference/](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/input-output-reference/)\n\n\n\nOr by posting the question to this awesome forum of EnergyPlus experts:\n\n[https://unmethours.com/questions/](https://unmethours.com/questions/)\n\n\n\nTo identify the degenerate surfaces, you can use the \"label zone surfaces\" component to label each surface of your HBZones with its name (in the rhino scene) and you can use this to find the buggy ones. \u00a0Upon thinking about your issue and knowing that I have run into similar situations myself, I have realized that it would be really useful to have a component that searches and pulls out the surfaces of a zone based on their names. \u00a0I have added this as an issue to the github and I will try to implement it at some point:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/386](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/386)\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 17, 2015 at 10:57am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1379985", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1380609"}
