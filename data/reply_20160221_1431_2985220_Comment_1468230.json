I tried rendering an image with it and got an exception stating that it should be used for radiation analysis only. Is there a way that I can use that component with Radiance and ray-tracing inside Honeybee?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "February 21, 2016 at 02:31PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1468223", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1468230"}
