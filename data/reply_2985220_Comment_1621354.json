{"body": "\nWell, you can always wrap the optimization code in a python script and execute it from inside Grasshopper (IronPython). Something like, run the analysis for a generation, push the data to the optimization algorithm, get the next generation and run it inside Grasshopper, and so on. The other option is to set-up the parameters from inside a python script and then use Grasshopper/Honeybee for running the analysis.\u00a0[Here is a very old post](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profiles/blogs/matlab-grasshopper)\u00a0on how to do it with Matlab. You can create a similar workflow from inside a Python script.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 19, 2016 at 7:08am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1620881", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1621354"}
