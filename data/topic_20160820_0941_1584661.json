{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI am trying to model a horizontal air wall in Honeybee (double height space) for an energy simulation.\n\nHowever, when I visualise the surface types after the energy simulation using the \"Decompose by type\" component it looks like Honeybee did not take into account the presence of the horizontal air wall.\n\nI read few previous posts on the topic and I am not sure whether it is possible to model horizontal air walls (even if I am sure there must be a way!).\n\n\n\nIs there anyone that could please advise on how to model correctly horizontal air walls in Honeybee?\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\n\nCarmelo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carmelo G.
