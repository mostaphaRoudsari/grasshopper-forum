{"body": "\nHey All,\n\n\n\nThank you for always being so prompt and helpful in all your responses.\n\n\n\nI had a question about the shading analysis.\u00a0\n\nI set up the honeybee wind analysis and it reflected difference in results as expected.\u00a0\n\nBut after setting up the shade evaluation, when I try to simulate it, it does not reflect any difference in results. It also does not show any error.<br/>\n\nI probably have missed out on entering some input correctly but I am just not able to figure out what that might be.\n\nI have attached the GH file.\n\n\n\nThank you so much again for all your help.<br/>\n\n\u00a0\n\nRegards,\n\nGhosh\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1267664", "name": "Shell_weather_Wind_Shading_test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Amrita Ghosh", "created_at": "April 20, 2015 at 2:34am", "created_by": "AmritaGhosh", "topic": "Energy Shade Evaluation error", "id": "topic_1267665"}
