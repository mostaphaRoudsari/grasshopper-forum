{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\nI am running energy simulations with Honeybee/energyPlus.I would like to be able to account for the influence of the urban context on one building's heating/cooling loads.\n\nThe solar masks aspects are ok. I have a brep for the urban context that I input in the \"Honeybee EP Context Surfaces\" component.\n\nBut I don't find the way to input albedo/reflectance values for the urban context. I have tried to input a RADMaterial in the \"Honeybee EP Context Surfaces\" component. But my simulation results do not change when I change the reflectance of the RADMaterial.\n\nMany thanks in advance for your help!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marc Lotteau", "created_at": "May 09, 2016 at 06:30AM", "created_by": "MarcLotteau", "topic": "Energy Simulation, taking into account albedo of urban context", "id": "topic_1526277"}
