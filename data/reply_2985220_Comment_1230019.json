{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\n\nThank you so much for the tips. I watched the first 12 videos, over the last week. Great videos and an awesome grasshopper plug-in, thanks a bunch. \u00a0I grabbed all the new components from github, then tried again, but I still have no luck. So what I did is I modeled the building again in Rhino and reduced the curves then I imported the geometry into GH and used the HoneyBee zone by surfaces component , but I noticed that after I grabbed the new components I get a \"NULL\" if I plug a panel to the final zone. \u00a0Finally I decided to model a very simple box and grab all its surfaces to create a zone , and to my surprise I still get \"NULL\" Am I doing something wrong ? here are what I did to create this one zone box\n\n1- modeled a 3d box in Rhino\n\n2- Exploded it\n\n3- In grasshopper I created HB-surfaces ( Floor, Ceiling, 4 individual walls and added I glazing by ratio to one of the walls)\n\nHere is an image, also I attached the file, the box components are grouped with an orange background. Now I'm convinced that I have a bug or something because it can't get easier than creating a zone from a simple box and yet I get a \"NULL\" message.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/GutZeHmFpMti-tD3Hyoo*BgqK1uQhbNj9tqnDmU9KhnScGzwpdxATJJMaFyCjfCt9CndI20G-lZipjoxbnWUQfEAwTQ8MqD9/Canvasat234140.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/GutZeHmFpMti-tD3Hyoo*BgqK1uQhbNj9tqnDmU9KhnScGzwpdxATJJMaFyCjfCt9CndI20G-lZipjoxbnWUQfEAwTQ8MqD9/Canvasat234140.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1230020", "name": "BOX.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1230021", "name": "Base_case_All-zone.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 10:57pm", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1229622", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1230019"}
