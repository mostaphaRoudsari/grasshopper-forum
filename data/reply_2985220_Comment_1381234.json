{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\n\nThank you for the suggestions. I'll try to find the bug in my model and ask in the E+ forum. To be honest I think that the problem is somewhere in the E+ tolerances, but it is hard to find a solution for that.\n\nGlad to hear that you are going to implement the surface check in the future.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nAntonio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonio D'Aquilio", "created_at": "October 18, 2015 at 5:15am", "created_by": "AntonioDAquilio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1380609", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1381234"}
