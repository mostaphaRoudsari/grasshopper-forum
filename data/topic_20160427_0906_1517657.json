{"body": "\nGreetings,\u00a0\n\n\n\nHas anyone had any success in modeling tree transparency with regards to outdoor thermal comfort? I am attempting to utilize the UTCI calculator in Ladybug with the use of the Solar Adjusted MRT component. There current does not seem to be a method for applying difference transparencies, or shading coefficients, to objects. Ideally, I would like to be able to group my trees into layers by species and then apply a shading coefficient per tree type while keeping these separate from the opaque context.\n\nThanks in advance for the feedback. \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kit Elsworth", "created_at": "April 27, 2016 at 09:06AM", "created_by": "KitElsworth", "topic": "Outdoor Comfort and Tree Transparency", "id": "topic_1517657"}
