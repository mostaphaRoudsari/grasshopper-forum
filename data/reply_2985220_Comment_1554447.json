{"body": "\nHi Jacek,\n\n\n\nI am not aware of a specific book or website which deals with these issues.\n\n\n\nOn UTCI, you can\u00a0[google and find](http://www.utci.org/isb/documents/windsor_vers04.pdf) a lot of publications. UTCI\u00a0[official website](http://www.utci.org/utci_doku.php) also contains valuable information.\n\n\n\nOn PET, you can check [these publications](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ztfsqzqm223tpj2/PETpublications.zip?dl=0).\n\n<br/>On all other indices from the Thermal Comfort Indices component, you will have to run each one them, and then check the explanations of their outputs (you hover with your mouse pointer on any of the outputs). For example, you hover over the THI (Temperature Humidity Index, _comfortIndex = 17) and you see that it is currently used in Taiwan as their official feel like temperature. You can also see its limitations (thi.jpg attached below).\n\nThe other way is to double click on the Thermal Comfort Indices icon, and scroll down to the line 429. From there you can find some details about each index, the publication, its author and so (phs.jpg attached below).\n\nNot all indices will contain the exact name of the publication from which they have been derived. Some will contain only the author name and a year. You can try to google the author name along with the name of the index.\n\n<br/>Chris Mackey is the author of the Outdoor Comfort Calculator component so he can also provide valuable information.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1554448", "name": "thi.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1554449", "name": "phs.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "June 23, 2016 at 8:01am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1554342", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1554447"}
