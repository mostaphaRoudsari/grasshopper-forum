{"body": "\nHi Dan and Sarith,\n\nIf we can solve the licensing issues for distributing Accelerad libraries then it's pretty easy to do so. Currently the license is just for a single user. I briefly talked to Nathaniel about this at the Radiance workshop last year. If they change the licensing then we can think about adding it as an option. You may want to get in touch with Nathaniel and ask if there has been any changes about the licensing.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 29, 2016 at 5:00pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1474271", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1474529"}
