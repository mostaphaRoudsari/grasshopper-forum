{"body": "\nHi Annie,\n\n\n\nTHis is no longer a memory error. You need to either delete or purge the case folder and start over. It seems that your blockMesh has not created the points file which is located at constant/polyMesh folder. This could have happened because the blockmesh has not finished (if that is the whole log then blockMesh never finished). I would just clean everything and run the case again with the increased GB of memory. Make sure to take note of the total cells at the end of the blockMesh log.\n\n\n\nAlso, as a rule of thumb you can usually have a bit less than 1 million cells per 1GB of memory, although with modern operating systems you should set your max always a bit lower than your total memory.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "June 7, 2017 at 4:22am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1755996", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1765261"}
