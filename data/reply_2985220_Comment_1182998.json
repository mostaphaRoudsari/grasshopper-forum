{"body": "\nMasoome,\n\nI realized that, as long as you do not need the blinds between the glass panes to be dynamic, all that you need is the\u00a0WindowMaterial:Blind:EquivalentLayer and not the\u00a0Shading Control object. \u00a0Accordingly, you can do this with Honeybee fairly easily and you can see how to set this up below and in the attached GH file.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3pbaBKayUO8nzJBIMWHCIvBH9qg*bQ5E3TDhCLX2kqJ1iIVeCQb2wOBRinjMYRuOoHViGfGLtlrhWA6ZSFCqwFd6GLtI3Dba/CreatingWindowWithBlindsBetweenPanes.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3pbaBKayUO8nzJBIMWHCIvBH9qg*bQ5E3TDhCLX2kqJ1iIVeCQb2wOBRinjMYRuOoHViGfGLtlrhWA6ZSFCqwFd6GLtI3Dba/CreatingWindowWithBlindsBetweenPanes.PNG)\n\nSorry to both you and Mostapha for not realizing this sooner and overcomplicating the issue. \u00a0I should have just followed Mostapha's\u00a0initial\u00a0suggestion and not worried about getting dynamic\u00a0shading to work. \u00a0Masoome, let me know if you need the blinds to be on a dynamic schedule and, if so, the issue may be as complicated as I originally made it.\n\nI will add in an official component soon so that you do not have to edit the big block of text to change the properties of the blinds construction layer.\n\nBy the way, from this\u00a0initial\u00a0test I have noticed a big drop in cooling energy when the blinds are placed in between the glass. \u00a0This seems like a fruitful line of research!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1182999", "name": "Simple Energy Simulation Base_Blinds.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 7, 2014 at 4:02pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182982", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182998"}
