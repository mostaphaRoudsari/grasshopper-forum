{"body": "\nWhen I've used the Ideal Loads Systems in the past, it's been without Economizer and Heat Recovery (for the reasons you list), and I've created custom ventilation schedules (fan or nat vent) to account for the actual building economizer and/or ventilation (as you discuss). \u00a0The problem with this method is that it is impossible to get the setpoints and schedules just right so that the Ideal Loads System doesn't end up working too hard either on the heating or cooling end of things.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen I saw the Ideal Loads System component in HB I got excited because I thought you'd solved the economizer \"problem.\" \u00a0It threw me for a loop when I didn't see the economizer impact the cooling energy use, but I think you're correct that the Ideal Loads System is just reporting sensible + latent heat in/out. \u00a0That said, I have the suspicion that there must be a way of breaking out the economizer \"energy savings\" or the EPlus developers wouldn't have included this option in the component. \u00a0Same with heat recovery. \u00a0I'll do a little bit of research in the EPlus documentation and then test your new component. \u00a0I'll try to get back to you in the next few days, but it might take more time.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Burin", "created_at": "March 1, 2015 at 12:08pm", "created_by": "Burin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1233905", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1234006"}
