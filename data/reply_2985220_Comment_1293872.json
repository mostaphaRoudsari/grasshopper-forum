{"body": "\nMost of the severe error relate to the Solar Distribution in the zone. When the zone is concave (L shape) this Distribution may give errors when set to Full Exterior and Interior\" (which i think is default value). You can control this parameter with the HB_EnergySimPar -- solarDistribution_ input (probably ti FullExterior only).\n\nRegarding the other discussion i have to say that i didn't understand well the question, so don't know what to suggest. My feeling is that MaxRad is unnecesary, but again, i may have misunderstood the question.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 24, 2015 at 7:52am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1293560", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1293872"}
