So, if you run everything in your script together, it should work.\n\n\n\nI also know that outdoor microclimate maps are time intensive and they are really built for cases where you need a lot of freedom to test different strategies and geometries (like all of the strategies E+ can run and all of the geometries that Rhino can create). \u00a0If you are ok with the simplification of ENVI-MET's pixel world, you don't need to test strategies beyond the usual ones, and your test area is small enough to be accommodated by ENVI-MET's free license (I forget how many pixels by how many pixels it allows), Antonello has built a connection from Ladybug to ENVI-MET that he posted here:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/lb-envi-met](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/lb-envi-met)\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 9, 2017 at 6:43am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1748083", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1748362"}
