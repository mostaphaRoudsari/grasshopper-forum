{"body": "\nReiner,\n\nI could not replicate your error but I can think of 2 reasons why this is happening. \u00a0The first is that you were using a LB_LB that was all of the way back from August with a brand new component form October. \u00a0The second could be that, when I added in the new method this weekend and had certain inputs go blank, the component freaked out because it didn't know where these inputs are. \u00a0I just put in some extra checks that should prevent these situations from happening in the future. \u00a0Let me know if the attached file works.\n\n\n\nYou have won me over with the temperature asymmetry argument. \u00a0I am sure that the asymmetry is way out of the bounds of ASHRAE's acceptable limits and you should be able to see this. \u00a0Also, maybe there is a way that we could do an average radiant temperature over an analysis period in those cases. \u00a0I will try to get to this feature soon:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/97](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/97)\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1158470", "name": "AdjustedMRT_Error_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 30, 2014 at 12:25PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1158399", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1158469"}
