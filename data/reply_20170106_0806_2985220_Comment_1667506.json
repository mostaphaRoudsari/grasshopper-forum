{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI've been giving a look to your file. I was not understanding why you were getting that result, and I have to say that your way of setting up the zones is quite unfamiliar for me, so I may be wrong.\n\nAs soon as I added materials (if you had add them in a different way they were not working for me) it had sense[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7gjKKn4oGHTH2jyXHxq7XnsSea-qd-1qE7cUCRDOXErlvZCAvYiHaGvyGW2FG5FJONYh-avvozedvboTT8ZoOgt8-bjdutLp/Capture.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/7gjKKn4oGHTH2jyXHxq7XnsSea-qd-1qE7cUCRDOXErlvZCAvYiHaGvyGW2FG5FJONYh-avvozedvboTT8ZoOgt8-bjdutLp/Capture.PNG)You can see that the comfort chart when the windows are closed is the same, as it should be. When they are open you can see that the temperatures decrease and the RH increases (as it is high outside). There is also\u00a0similar shapes on the comfort chart as the airflow volume showing when the windows are close for excessive temperature creating discomfort, this is logic, as your windows close at 28 degrees, what is not considered \"comfortable\" (however there are studies explaining it is comfort in certain situations, as in buildings with natural ventilation).\n\n\n\nMy guess is that energy plus was not reading properly your materials. Probably Mostapha and Chris will answer to this better than me\n\n\n\nI have grouped the things I added to your script, hope it helps. If you upload the IDF I may try to help you a bit more until someone else helps you better.\n\n\n\nJulia\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1667508", "name": "Issueaboutac_Julia.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Julia T", "created_at": "January 06, 2017 at 08:06AM", "created_by": "JuliaT", "parent_id": "topic_1667640", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1667506"}
