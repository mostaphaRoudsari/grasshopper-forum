{"body": "\nHi Mona,\n\n\n\nIt depends how you want to simulate the airflow and what is the question of your thesis.\n\n\n\nFor thermal simulation you can use Honeybee and it will support what you need. Chris recently developed new components that lets you run studies for airflow changes for simple cases integrated to Energy Simulation but it is limited to what you can do with EnergyPlus (e.g. it is not CFD).\n\n\n\nIf you want to model airflow between zones with EnergyPlus then you probably want to set up an Airflow Network which we don't support right now. I don't know if there is any other plugin to do that but I'm sure other people on the group can help you with that.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: I intentionally didn't use the word natural ventilation, but you can read airflow changes as natural ventilation!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 02, 2015 at 11:52PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1215809", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1215955"}
