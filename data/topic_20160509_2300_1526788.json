{"body": "\nHi Chris,<br/>May I ask you a question about Therm? I have trouble in understanding the way Therm calculates the U value. I think that it should be like this: lambda(W/mk which Therm knows as Conductivity of the material) divided to depth(m). Then for adjacent materials, They should \u00a0be summed up according to their areas or here since it is 2D according to their lengths in proportion to the whole length. This means that for a singular material Lambda and U-value must be equal if the depth is 1000 mm, But in Therm they are significantly different. Am I missing something?\u00a0<br/>\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Farnaz", "created_at": "May 09, 2016 at 11:00PM", "created_by": "Farnaz609", "topic": "Therm", "id": "topic_1526788"}
