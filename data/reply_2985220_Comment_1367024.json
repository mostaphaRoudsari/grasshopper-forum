{"body": "\nHi Shane,\n\nThis is a great suggestion. Since the view analysis is very subjective it is really hard to come up with a solution that address all the issues. If I remember right the very first version of Ladybug actually had a viewAnalysisPar that would let you to set the viewFieldAngles. Also all the view points used to be weighted based on the angle.\n\nThe feedback was that this is not the right way of measuring the view. For example people can turn their head around, and also they don't really seat perpendicular to the window. In many offices the layout is to sitting parallel to the window and in the case you will be actually seeing the point in the off angle. Then I removed the input and added waiting factor, but there are cases like yours that it won't be useful.\n\nAll said I personally can see the value of having a field of view input or an output for all the angles which can be used to remove the points afterwards.\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 22, 2015 at 5:24pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1361876", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1367024"}
