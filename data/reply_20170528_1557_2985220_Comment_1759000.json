{"body": "\nCamila,\n\n\n\nYou are comparing 5 hours on June 21st with 5 hours on December 21st. That is just not enough data for one to draw any conclusions. Because as per your argument, it is impossible for any five hours in June to be warmer than any five hours in December. Direct-Normal radiation is purely a function of the amount radiation received directly from the sun. So, if the five hours in December 21 in your calculation were cloudy, the amount of direct-radiation for those hours will be zero. Secondly, your statement that.. \"The temperature is ok, but radiance shuold be like temperature..\" is not correct. It can be that you feel warmer on a cloudy day than you do on a sunny day.\n\n\n\nThe monthly weather data for Sao Paulo indicates that most of the rainfall occurs in the months of January and December. This implies that the direct-normal radiation for those months will be low, but the global-horizontal radiation will be high. And this is consistent with the results you are getting.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/JPX5gKnxX7I6a9OPp5C1Yds7u-uRexx7IRSomPzhSjlJruOXB-LoKySBbXf6zGxegoxjUiRfAhuHgmW9sBK4eWcLkwVHlXS8/Selection_234.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/JPX5gKnxX7I6a9OPp5C1Yds7u-uRexx7IRSomPzhSjlJruOXB-LoKySBbXf6zGxegoxjUiRfAhuHgmW9sBK4eWcLkwVHlXS8/Selection_234.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry comparing more number of hours in Winter versus Summer. Something like (10AM to 3PM)* ( June 1 - June 30) versus (10AM to 3PM)*(December 1 - December 30). Finally, for the climate in Sao Paulo, it makes sense to compare direct-normal and global horizontal radiations separately.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 28, 2017 at 03:57PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1759212", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1759000"}
