{"body": "\nHi Leland,\n\nthanks for your explaination. I am starting to understand which the results mean. My doubts start watching the different kinds of skys, expecially seeing the Climate based sky for grid analysis. Mostapha explained that it can be used only for a specific time in the year because using that sky for a annual analysis means to run 8700 analysis, one for each hour of the year. So, if I understand well, using \"readDSHourlyResults\" and choosing the same HOY I used for grid analysis with Climate Based Sky, I should have the same result?\n\nThanks a lot for your time\n\nDavid\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Maimone", "created_at": "February 1, 2016 at 8:31am", "created_by": "DavidMaimone", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1451934", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1452023"}
