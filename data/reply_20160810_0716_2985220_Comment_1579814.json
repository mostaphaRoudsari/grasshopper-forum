{"body": "Claudia,\nTherise one other difference, which is that the Ladybug components are stable and currently out of the WIP section while the Honeybee ones still need a bit more time to be developed. As such, I would use the Ladybug components if you need something stable at the moment. We are switching over to developing the OpenStudio component as opposed to the E+ exporter in the next few months. Hopefully, Anton will do the OpenStudio implementation in a manner that fixes a lot of the known bugs\n-Chris.", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 10, 2016 at 07:16AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579577", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579814"}
