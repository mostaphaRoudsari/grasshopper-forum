{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\nThank you so much for your reply. What you said are quite useful since this question has been bothering me for a long time. I do need to model 4-state controls. I have tried many other software as well (like COMFEN,\u00a0Designbuilder, and CBE Thermal Comfort Model), but none of these software work. I really hope it could work in grasshopper. Could you please be more specific about the program that can edit the simulation as E+ is running? It would be great if you can find a link. I would love to have a try.\u00a0\n\nThank you again!\n\nYihong\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Agnes", "created_at": "February 1, 2017 at 10:39am", "created_by": "Agnes", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1682716", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1682669"}
