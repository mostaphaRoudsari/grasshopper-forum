{"body": "\nTheodoros,\n\n\u00a0\n\nI haven't run into the memory issues you describe, but\u00a0I'll comment on how we could\u00a0pollination to better inform our design process. Long post, I know, but I'm curious what everyone thinks about our take on the issue.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow do\u00a0we use it? Why do\u00a0we use it? These are great questions.\u00a0SGJJR sees the potential of using iterative parametric models to\u00a0chart the design space. Understanding how the current design performs is helpful, but the next question is always \"what can we do to make it better.\" If we understand the design space we can predict how to improve the design and discuss the ramifications of such decisions when they are being made. Too often decisions are made without a full understanding of the consequences because analysis is expensive and not timely enough to feasibly include it in a meeting. This is especially true in conceptual design, when some of the most important decisions are made.\u00a0In practice,\u00a0tools like Pollination can empower a conversational\u00a0design process that allows an integrated team to collaborate far more effectively. The trick in our mind is predictive modeling, which pollination supports. The goal should be to direct the team towards the critical design decisions, make\u00a0the right\u00a0call, and move on.\u00a0This process is empowered when models account for competing metrics, such as cost, energy and daylight quality. I'm curious how others think these tools can be applied. It is\u00a0incredible to be able to calculate 1000 iterations, and I trust everyone on this forum to figure out the nuts and bolts to make that possible,\u00a0but what do we do with it? What design decisions are we targeting? What should we be targeting?\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne successful small example we did was to inform the interior design of an office building. We had some ideas about changing the room finishes, cubicle heights, cubicle finish, and of creating a lighter colored perimeter floor band. All of these things went against the interior design. By running every combination of these input parameters (at several settings) we were able to quickly determine that all successful designs had low cubicles. Rather than waste time fighting over finishes, we held firm on the cubicles and compromised on everything else. I imagine\u00a0more teams can use\u00a0pollination to guide the design process in this way. Rather than use Pollination to optimize, it empowers\u00a0us to understand the design space, identify the critical parameters, and chart a path forward.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou mentioned massing and orientation. I think this is a huge opportunity for us all.\u00a0These decisions are often made long before proper analysis is considered, because up until now that analysis has been too slow, too expensive and not useful enough. This new tech can change all that. It's a tough problem.\u00a0Site constraints, programming constraints, and client preferences rightly play a large part, but we\u00a0need to\u00a0understand performance as well. What do our architects need to know when developing that first blocking mass study? What drives performance?\u00a0As our architects balance 18 different goals, what\u00a0are the critical things they need to consider to understand performance?\u00a0It's not enough to know that\u00a0too much glazing will hurt EUI.\u00a0That will not sway the designer.\u00a0Knowing that there is no way to meet LEED platinum with that southwest glassy atrium, will. Identifying that the only solutions that perform well have certain things in common will encourage those concerns to rise in the hierarchy of criteria being considered.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo what metrics are we\u00a0calculating? My first instinct is EUI, cost, DA, and ASE. But that's not actually what we are looking for. Our architects care about % of\u00a0regularly occupied area that is well daylit, or if we are going to meet our energy or budget targets. We need to take a step past the raw metric and translate that into a design decision recommendation. Displaying the data in\u00a0terms of\u00a0\"% Well daylit\", \"% EUI under target\", and\u00a0\"$/sf\" are more useful to the team.\u00a0Anyone have other suggestions?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat input parameters\u00a0can we control to affect performance?\u00a0Floor-to-floor height, plate depth, ceiling height, fenestration design, construction type,\u00a0orientation, external shading, massing options, mechanical system choice. That's a lot of iterations, but in theory, we should be able to study all combinations. What else am I missing?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCan anyone share links to articles or white papers that explore this topic? I'm eager to learn more and hear what other people are thinking.\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "February 02, 2016 at 09:01AM", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "topic_1449569", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1452919"}
