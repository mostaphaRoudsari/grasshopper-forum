{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\n\n\nJust a clarification with PCMs. Are there any specific settings I have to tweak when creating a custom material which is a PCM? i.e., will it be able to accurately mirror the effects of phase change during diurnal swings?\n\n\n\nOr do I simply copy the values for conductivity, density, etc. (as is) from here:\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283723280_Energy_performan...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283723280_Energy_performance_of_building_envelopes_integrated_with_phase_change_materials_for_cooling_load_reduction_in_tropical_Singapore)\n\n\n\nThank you.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "huntan", "created_at": "July 14, 2016 at 12:58am", "created_by": "huntan", "topic": "PCM materials", "id": "topic_1565835"}
