{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nI know and feel your pain very deeply in my own workflow. \u00a0Mostapha, you describe my current process very accurately but, while it gets the job done, it inevitably ends up blowing up my GH file into a huge spaghetti mess. This is because we have to perform the geometry transformation BEFORE turning the geometry into HBZones, which means that all of the properties that you change/assign to your original zones have to be done again to the new transformed zones as well. \u00a0Oftentimes, I have repeating floors and I just want to keep these same zone properties through the geometric transformation.\n\nThings get particularly out of hand if you have to do such transformations more than 2 times (I had to do it for a 5-story building once).\n\nTo address this issue, I have had it on my agenda for a while to make a component that re-evaluates HBZone geometry and adds any zones transformed with native GH components\u00a0to the HB hive as new HBZones. \u00a0This way, you could perform any of the common transforms to zone geometry (translation, scale, rotation, reflection) and have Honeybee able to understand these zones as geometrically-altered versions of the original zones.\n\nI forgot to make this agenda item into a githib issue but now that you have reminded me...\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/373](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/373)\n\nI will try to get to this sometime soon.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 08, 2015 at 11:12PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1357001", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1357328"}
