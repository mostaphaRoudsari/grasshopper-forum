{"body": "\nHello, <br/> I am working on some fa\u00e7ade design and I used Tilt and Orientation Factor (TOF) component to find optimal angle of PV panels. Now need to find out the best size of PV panel size upon given array of windows.<br/><br/> Let\u2019s assume that the fa\u00e7ade has 4 by 4 windows and each of it has room at the back side. Also the width of the PV panels are equal to the width of the window. The problem is to find the length of the PV panel. Because the upper panels will obviously make shadow over the lower ones. Thus, what would be the maximum length of the PV panel in terms of solar harvesting?<br/>[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/dCEfApjkVSCsqpilujkAEcNuey3oSQH-MolYzpdP2rlwkbrPiXnLLel7Yg5k6kiL7HrJ3Xn1RpXXWtVGOzG0**7q7MOIbxBX/Screenshot.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/dCEfApjkVSCsqpilujkAEcNuey3oSQH-MolYzpdP2rlwkbrPiXnLLel7Yg5k6kiL7HrJ3Xn1RpXXWtVGOzG0**7q7MOIbxBX/Screenshot.jpg)\n\nI have been looking around the forum and watched some tutorial but not very sure whether LB and HB has this kind of component (I don\u2019t think that would exist maybe i should use Galapagos?) and I will be very appreciated if you give any suggestions regarding this issue.<br/> <br/> Thank you very much for your time.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1492207", "name": "Finding optimal size of PV in given array.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1492208", "name": "Finding optimal size of PV in given array..gh"}], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "March 25, 2016 at 11:13AM", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "topic": "Finding an optimal size of PV panel in given array.", "id": "topic_1492209"}
