{"body": "\nHi Wesley,\n\nThank you for posting here.\n\nI can confirm that you are getting this error because your OpenStudio json file does not load up correctly when you let Honeybee fly for the first time. \u00a0First, I should ask as a point of habit: have you let both Ladybug and Honeybee fly by dropping them both onto the canvas? \u00a0I do not see them in the image that you uploaded and I ask just in case.\n\n\n\nSecond, if you have let both fly, do you have a file called\u00a0OpenStudio_Standards.json in your C:\\Ladybug folder or in this folder:\n\nC:\\Users\\yourUserName\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\n\n\n\nIf not, something might be blocking the download of these files in the background and we may have to have you copy the files into these folders manually.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 17, 2014 at 02:55PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1150828", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1150907"}
