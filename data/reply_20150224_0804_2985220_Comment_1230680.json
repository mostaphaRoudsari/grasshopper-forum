{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nChris, Mostapha, team, thank you for the great work so far! I would be keen on trying any beta release of the integration of HB to EPC. I think it will add a great value to the plug-in and will bring its functionality to a whole new level! Any indication on when this might be due to release? Also a similar integration of a Passive House standard calculations sheet would be very handy! I am attaching a PHPP Demo calculation sheet that is provided for free from the PassiveHouse institute in Germany ([www.passiv.de](http://www.passiv.de)). Is only for indicative purposes, just to get an idea!\u00a0\n\n\n\nLooking forward!\u00a0\n\n\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1230682", "name": "PHPP2007_English_Demo.xls"}], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 24, 2015 at 08:04AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "topic_1216749", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1230680"}
