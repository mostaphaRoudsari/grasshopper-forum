{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThanks to new release of Honey bee. It is actually a great job.\n\nI have a very simple shoe box model with a window. I've tried to use all 8 CPUs of my system to run \u00a0just an static simulation (just for one hour 21 June @12:00). I got an Out of memory error.\n\nThe only special thing that I used is a dielectric material.\n\nwould you please help me to figure out this problem.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n\nFazel\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1468865", "name": "01.png"}], "created_by_name": "Fazel Ganji", "created_at": "February 22, 2016 at 11:39AM", "created_by": "fazelganji", "topic": "Out of memory error", "id": "topic_1468867"}
