{"body": "\nHello,\n\nwhere or how it is possible to get the values of the average diffuse material reflectance of the basic surface types (srfType_) of the component Honeybee_createHBSrfs? ( 0-WALL 0.5-Undergroundwall 1-ROOF 1.5-UndergroundCeiling 2-FLOOR etc.).\n\nI think had found them some time ago but I don't find the info anymore. Thank you!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "September 16, 2016 at 1:24am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "Reflectance values Honeybee surfaces", "id": "topic_1600208"}
