{"body": "\nHey\n\n\n\nWe are having issues running just a basic energy+ model. I've stripped down the file to quite a basic level (see attached) but we still can't seem to get anything meaningful out. I am not sure if I am doing something dumb, whether the rhino geom is corrupt or there is a bug in the components I am running. \u00a0\n\n\n\nI'm sure I am missing something obvious.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nDunc\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1391009", "name": "Colby_150211_DC.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1391310", "name": "Colby_150211_DC.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "November 02, 2015 at 09:14AM", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "topic": "SCHEDULETYPELIMITS Fatal Error", "id": "topic_1391311"}
