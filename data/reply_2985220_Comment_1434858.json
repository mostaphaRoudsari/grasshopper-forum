{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThe error was not fixed. I'm still having this:\n\nRuntime error (UnboundNameException): name 'viewPtsWeights_' is not defined<br/>Traceback:<br/>\u00a0 line 531, in script\n\nwith the Jan 8 version. You left in line 531 the variable viewPtsWeights, which is not in the inputs anymore. For now i changed the code giving \"1\" instead the variable, so the component can run, but i know that viewPtsWeights shows in other places.\n\nThe differences with VSC go between 5 to 20% or more (depending if the sample point is more exposed to the sky). This is really far away.\n\nI'm good with the other explanations.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 9, 2016 at 1:29am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1434747", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1434858"}
