{"body": "\nHi Tasos (Sorry I misspelled your name up there!),\n\nI have never used BSDF in EnergyPlus but I think the structure should be different. Looks like you can use Window to generate BSDF definitions for EnergyPlus ([https://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/7/7.3.4/w7_releasenotes.htm](https://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/7/7.3.4/w7_releasenotes.htm)). Then you should be able to copy the string and apply it as a construction to Honeybee surfaces. Please keep me posted. We can see if there is a better way to implement it to Honeybee.\n\nI developed the component while I was working for the company and technically they own the code. I may re-write a similar component in the near future but for now I don't have the ownership to make the decision. :|\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 1, 2015 at 7:12am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412780", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1413052"}
