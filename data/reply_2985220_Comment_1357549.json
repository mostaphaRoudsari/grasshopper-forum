{"body": "\nMostapha and Chris, thank you for your fast reply.\n\n\n\nI have tried to contact the DesignBuilder team for this, but the problem is that the import of gbXML is not working perfectly I am afraid. My main goal was to make the natural ventilation simulation through DB. I am trying to find another way to simulate natural ventilation, and regarding this I have posted another discussion.\n\nIf you want you can have a look here: [http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interzone-a...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interzone-airflow-rate-for-a-large-volume?xg_source=activity)\n\nI hope someone can help me.\n\n\n\nThank you very much again.\n\nAntonio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonio D'Aquilio", "created_at": "September 9, 2015 at 10:19am", "created_by": "AntonioDAquilio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1347723", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1357549"}
