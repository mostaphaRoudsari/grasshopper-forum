{"body": "\nHello Dustin,\n\nThank you for your answer ! I'm just starting with Ladybug and I had not seen we could do some radiation analysis ! So I made a sheet calculating it from the formulas I had. I guess I have some other tutorials to watch :) Thanks for letting me know about it.\n\nActually my problem was not really about radiation calculation but more some original Grasshopper treatment but anyways, I managed to solve the problem already !\n\n\n\nYoan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yoan", "created_at": "June 2, 2016 at 8:02pm", "created_by": "Yoan", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1540688", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1541214"}
