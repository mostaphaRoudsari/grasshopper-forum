{"body": "\nHi Mostapha! I want to create windows by building levels (like in the link below that I sent). After this error, I tried to create manually the building levels, and I did it, but it didn't work in the daylight simulation ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/simulation-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/simulation-error-epzone-object-has-no-attribute-cenpt-geometry?xg_source=activity)). So, I gave up and simulated different levels just changing the work plane height, haha. Can you help me with this?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andressa L.
