{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you for your input. I assumed that it was the Meteonorm Weather Files because the simulation does give outputs when I use weather files downloaded from the EnergyPlus website but it does not when I use Meteonorm weather files (it does for daylight though).\n\n\n\nI attach the model and the weather file in case it is of any help.\n\nThanks,\n\nBlanca\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1337736", "name": "energyTest.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1337737", "name": "Lagos_Ikeja-hour.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Blanca Dasi Espuig", "created_at": "August 4, 2015 at 8:22am", "created_by": "BlancaDasiEspuig", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1337199", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1337735"}
