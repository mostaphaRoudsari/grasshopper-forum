{"body": "\nHi Marc,\n\n\n\nRADMaterial will only and only be used when the file is getting exported to Radiance. This is normal that it's not changing the results.\n\n\n\nEnergyPlus shading objects don't have a field for reflectance and use .2 as default. You can use [ShadingProperty:Reflectance](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-1/input-output-reference/page-011.html#shadingpropertyreflectance)\u00a0to change the default value. We don't support this in Honeybee interface right now but you can create the objects and add them to your energy model using additionalStrings_\u00a0input.\n\n\n\nI put a simple example together were I change the reflection for shading surfaces to .5 for unglazed part of shading and portion and .7 for glazed part. I also set the percentage of glazing to 50% of the surface area.\n\nI didn't put any input checks. Make sure to read the documentation to put valid input values for energyplus otherwise the energyplus simulation will fail. I also assumed that all the shading surfaces (context) will be planar surfaces.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ZGfhtH4*NPR9Kgxe94uspPh4lupqOZDWeDi4y*HtzwrGNrgS7HQBwaCsD*OblsAfERPDknAR40NiKwwMZZeBg5n*3FsyYD7G/shadingReflectance.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ZGfhtH4*NPR9Kgxe94uspPh4lupqOZDWeDi4y*HtzwrGNrgS7HQBwaCsD*OblsAfERPDknAR40NiKwwMZZeBg5n*3FsyYD7G/shadingReflectance.png)\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that it will only effect the results if you are using one of the solar distributions with reflections. Honeybee is using\u00a0FullInteriorAndExteriorWithReflections by default so you should be fine if you're using the default settings.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1526513", "name": "shadingReflectance.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 09, 2016 at 08:38AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1526278", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1526511"}
