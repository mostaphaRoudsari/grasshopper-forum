{"body": "\nRobert,\n\nThis is the most detailed model of a house that I have seen with Honeybee. \u00a0Thanks for taking the components to places where they have not gone before.\n\nI opened your file and I was able to get the decompose based on type to run with your model, although, as you can see in the image below, it took 6 minutes:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/x5G1xVWcIZi7PgDf4283RApqWITmJQQXc9pGPGRElb3MACCgxpTTmZM7deMGrpxDY7jB2EwycJ2Zx-GqrShclEcQyNImkKwk/DecomposeWorking.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/x5G1xVWcIZi7PgDf4283RApqWITmJQQXc9pGPGRElb3MACCgxpTTmZM7deMGrpxDY7jB2EwycJ2Zx-GqrShclEcQyNImkKwk/DecomposeWorking.JPG)\n\nI think that we will have to chalk this one up to the fact that you have 31 zones and at least 250 surfaces in your model, which is good if you are trying to study really detailed phenomena in this house but it probably more than you need to get decently accurate energy use profiles for the whole building.\n\n\n\nIt really boils down to what data you are trying to get out of the model. \u00a0If you are trying to do detailed comfort map studies, I would recommend the level of detail that you have, although it might be better to split the house up into a few different GH files / energy models unless the phenomena that you are studying really needs to be informed by the energy flow through the whole structure. \u00a0If you are just trying to get a good estimate for the energy use of the whole house, a lot of your zones can be combined into larger zones and surfaces combined into larger surfaces without affecting the results much.\n\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 20, 2016 at 1:22pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1466373", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1467495"}
