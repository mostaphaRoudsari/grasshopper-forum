{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI noticed this already some time ago, I ask about here even if I think is something that concern Daysim more than Honeybee.\n\nThe issue is that when I want to analyse the electricity consumption and I use the Lighting Control Group component information into the Read Annual Results I using an occupancy file from 7-22 it happens to have electric light consumption very often during extra time (over night). You can see from the attached image 1. The problems doesn't happen with an occupancy file from 9 to 17 (image 2). I checked the occupancy file 7-22 and it is ok. Any clue of the problem?\n\nThank you.\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/mAhJbRiQDqGPRUFVdLoByLUvTUDF90X9oZciSEzfVIrTHmNYjJ6bcl1BYLC69rFe8gHbD-*k8cCzGvUhL1UfJPXMvfHyfbM2/722.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/mAhJbRiQDqGPRUFVdLoByLUvTUDF90X9oZciSEzfVIrTHmNYjJ6bcl1BYLC69rFe8gHbD-*k8cCzGvUhL1UfJPXMvfHyfbM2/722.JPG)\n\nIMG 1\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/mAhJbRiQDqHdK8A68ql8XQyQxmzyhrxud-zvDhbrMPQhV-TmuAr73s8QDNmLv*IAbiEOO9ESIDW0Ms98MpGXCHMEKdpz52E1/917.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/mAhJbRiQDqHdK8A68ql8XQyQxmzyhrxud-zvDhbrMPQhV-TmuAr73s8QDNmLv*IAbiEOO9ESIDW0Ms98MpGXCHMEKdpz52E1/917.JPG)\n\nIMG 2\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "December 02, 2015 at 07:39AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "Lighting Control Profiles issue", "id": "topic_1413400"}
