{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI love the captureView component, but want to export vector geometry not jpg or png. Can this be done?\n\n\n\nCurrently I can do this by manually baking geometry and manually exporting from Rhino, or by following the process outlined in this discussion:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/print-layout-from-gh](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/print-layout-from-gh)\n\n\n\nHowever, my goal is to fully automate this process without having to click on anything, just like the captureView component allows. Can this be done by adjusting the code within the captureView component?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nLeland\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "June 27, 2017 at 05:06PM", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "topic": "Is there a way to automatically export a pdf or vector graphic using captureView?", "id": "topic_1775360"}
