{"body": "\nHi Antonello,<br/><br/>Thank you for the reply and the visual explanation.<br/><br/>I think it could be beneficial if you would keep your \"_basePoint\" (or maybe even \"_baseOrigin\") input instead of \"_origin_\".<br/>In this way there will be no confusion between the input and output points. At the moment, \"_origin_\" input and \"originPt\" output of \"Terrain Generator\" component represent two completely different points. While \"origin_\" input and \"originPt\" output of the \"Terrain Generator 2\" component are the same points.\n\n<br/>I think we should also rename the output \"originPt\" to \"origin\". I would do the same with \"Terrain Generator 2\" component.<br/><br/>Sorry if this looks like a nitpicking. It's just in my opinion we should at least make both \"Terrain Generator\" components acting similar, at least when it comes to them being the predecessor components for other ones (like \"Terrain Analysis\").<br/><br/>I would like to hear your thoughts.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "October 04, 2016 at 04:47PM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1611008", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1610798"}
