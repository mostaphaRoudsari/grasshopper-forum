{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nFirstly I want to thank the team for creating this fantastic tool, especially Mostapha and Chris.\n\n\n\nAlso thank you for implementing the ability to use a vector for north in the latest release, no more manual rotation.. at least I thought.\n\n\n\nI have reason to believe the rotation of the model before calculation is reversed. See my simple example in the attached file below, also included some screenshots. The maximum solar irradiance on the surface happens early morning when I have the north vector pointing towards the positive x-axis and the surface direction pointing west. The maximum solar loads should occur late afternoon/evening as the sun sets in the west.\n\n\n\nIf I set the north vector to the positive or negative y-axis the results seem to be correct, hence my suspicion that the rotation is reversed.\n\n\n\nOr am I just missing something obvious here? :)\n\n\n\n-M\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1486678", "name": "HBLB-1.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1486679", "name": "HBLB-2.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1486680", "name": "Irradiance on surface.gh"}], "created_by_name": "M.
