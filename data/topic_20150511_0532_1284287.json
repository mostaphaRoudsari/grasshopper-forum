{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha, Chris and all,\n\n\n\nIn the new release of Honeybee ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/new-release...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/new-release-ladybug-0-0-59-and-honeybee-0-0-56)), it is said that \"energy results can be obtained for **curved NURBS surfaces** as well as **unconventional window configurations**\".\u00a0\n\nAnd I also noticed the following information form the optional input in the runEnergySimulation\u00a0component.\n\n\"meshSettings_: Optional mesh settings for your geometry from any one of the native Grasshopper mesh setting components. These will be used to change the meshing of curved surfaces before they are run through EnergyPlus (note that meshing of curved surfaces is done since Energyplus is not able to calculate heat flow through non-planar surfaces). Default Grasshopper meshing is used if nothing is input here but you may want to decrease your calculation time by changing it to Coarse or increase your curvature definition (and calculation time) by making it finer\".\n\n\n\n<font size=\"2\">1) My case is an one-story, rectangular-plan large hall (40m*70m*25m) with a curved roof. The roof surface is a part of a standard sphere and the walls and floor are all planar (the each wall has one curved\u00a0</font>edge as showed in the image<font size=\"2\">).</font>\n\n[<font size=\"2\"><img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/NjHDmKPq-vD1**38FcA483kS8CmIMxYLmiJ*0swWtvVYha54QfCBrI-E5oTNgqLZXUKVv7IqC-sI*OsYT8mWO3C1QnZpvgYz/QQ20150511130912.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/></font>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NjHDmKPq-vD1**38FcA483kS8CmIMxYLmiJ*0swWtvVYha54QfCBrI-E5oTNgqLZXUKVv7IqC-sI*OsYT8mWO3C1QnZpvgYz/QQ20150511130912.png)\n\n\n\n<font size=\"2\">For testing, I threw\u00a0the original\u00a0curved roof surface into daylight and energy simulations without making customized meshings, because I assumed that it might be automatically converted to meshs by Honeybee - **<u>Am I right? As showed in the image, how can I reduce the number of meshs in a proper way? Must two connected surfaces (i.e. wall and roof) be STRICTLY/SEAMLESSLY</u> <strong style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">connected or not\u00a0**<u>(considering different divisions of meshs in the respective surface)? - Is a\u00a0**<u>connection\u00a0</u>**tolerance\u00a0</u></strong>**<u>allowed?</u>**</font>\n\n<font size=\"2\">2) But, when I run the annual daylight simulation for this case, it gave me a lot of warnings\u00a0**\"oconv: warning - zero area for polygon\"**.- **is that normal? and\u00a0how to avoid this? Does the daylight simulation allo****w \"****curved NURBS surfaces\"?**</font>\n\n<font size=\"2\">**[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/NjHDmKPq-vC2f0afDooAo7C9sPrnDztqNwOPgodJaDi9ungTvk6y2nxpZcat9b7HYRTvVHZNL59cYLVQw2Orsz26c1h7nFkZ/QQ20150511140036.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NjHDmKPq-vC2f0afDooAo7C9sPrnDztqNwOPgodJaDi9ungTvk6y2nxpZcat9b7HYRTvVHZNL59cYLVQw2Orsz26c1h7nFkZ/QQ20150511140036.jpg)**</font>\n\n3) Moreover, when I run an energy simulation for\u00a0this case, it costed extremely long time. It was just so long that I did not even\u00a0have results out of one simulation.\u00a0**<font size=\"2\">- I guessed it might be the problem caused by the\u00a0curved roof surface (or\u00a0</font>automatic<font size=\"2\">\u00a0meshing?), but I don't have experience of converting a curved\u00a0NURBS/spheral\u00a0<strong><font size=\"2\">surface into correct meshs that can be recognized by Honeybee\u00a0simulations (<strong><font size=\"2\"><strong><font size=\"2\">Daylight and\u00a0Energy</font>**</font></strong>) in a **<font size=\"2\"><strong><font size=\"2\">proper way</font>**</font></strong>.\u00a0</font></strong></font></strong>\n\n**<font size=\"2\"><strong>[<font size=\"2\"><img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/NjHDmKPq-vBjL1SLu8gdGlbrm3s2P-fo33ye-lmaHJjB7Fe6xmQt6USNGGJuJc4qfT6PcT8i94ix1xd*n6jMkJwoSA2S9Uur/QQ20150511141932.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/></font>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NjHDmKPq-vBjL1SLu8gdGlbrm3s2P-fo33ye-lmaHJjB7Fe6xmQt6USNGGJuJc4qfT6PcT8i94ix1xd*n6jMkJwoSA2S9Uur/QQ20150511141932.jpg)**</font></strong>\n\n\n\n4)\u00a0The large window on the wall was generated by the \"_glzRatio\".
