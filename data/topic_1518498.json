{"body": "\nHi guys,\u00a0\n\n\n\n&lt;3 your plugins, am very impressed.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am running into a problem and can't find a solution in the forum:\u00a0\n\nIn the Indoor View Factor Calculator component, when I have plugged in my zones and toggle _buildMesh to 'true', I get the error message:\"Solution exception:'Mesh' object has no attribute 'Vertices'.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThere was some advice in the comments of [http://www.food4rhino.com/project/ladybug-honeybee?ufh&amp;page=1](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/ladybug-honeybee?ufh&amp;page=1) \u00a0to replace .Vertices with .DuplicateVertices() in the python script editor, but then I just get this message: \"1. Solution exception:'Mesh' object has no attribute 'DuplicateVertices'\".\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'd love to get this component working, I really need to visualise comfort and temperature data over surfaces in building!\u00a0\n\n\n\nRhino 5 SR5, GH0.9.0076 and have updated LadyBug and Honeybee and all components.\n\n\n\nMy gh file is attached illustrating problem.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nFrank\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1518497", "name": "Indoor_View_Factor_Calculator_Problem_02.gh"}], "created_by_name": "fjb", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 3:49am", "created_by": "fjb", "topic": "Honeybee_Indoor View Factor Calculator, \"Solution exception:'Mesh' object has no attribute 'Vertices'", "id": "topic_1518498"}
