{"body": "\nThanks for both of your input!\n\n\n\nI ended up only placing one window per surface for other reasons, but mostaphas solution\u00a0for multiple windows is saved for future use. its nifty.<br/><br/>In my fenestration algorithm I will always have instances where different genome create the same geometry. Unfortunately. Also, I\u00b4ve realized that octopus by nature wants to do multiple runs with the same genomes as generations progress. Now I am looking to build a database of simulation results tied to geometry. So that when octopus creates a genome --&gt; builds a geometry i will check this geometry and see if its been simulated before, and if it has I will supply this result to octopus, bypassing the simulation run. This should save time. I'm gonna try to do this with native components within GH. If anyone has done this or has an efficient way to do it, I\u00b4d be happy if you shared it. :) <br/><br/>It seems it would be a workflow that could save computing time in every case you have high computaional burden and discrete slider values.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "March 10, 2016 at 06:19AM", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1456602", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1481225"}
