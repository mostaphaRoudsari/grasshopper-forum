{"body": "\nHi Tim,\n\nBack to values when you use only an hour the values are going to be much smaller because that's only the value for a single hour. The one that you're showing up there is a cloudy hour and sky is pretty diffuse.\n\nI made a gif file that I hope for better understanding of the cumulative sky. I generated the sky for 20 July in Chicago between 7 am and 5 pm. On the left you see the sky for each hour and you can see how the radiation values of the sky are assigned to sky patches for each hour. On the right you can see how cumulative sky gets built based on values for each hour for a single day.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/d70k96K0o0kpAforfvIFvNxmlPooylRiMrdFiIrR1sZbyW7NHKTNsjUDzOsj6-lB6ePBW8RFRP08q6huy3bJGPwXJxza7K-g/output_znZoAX.gif?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/d70k96K0o0kpAforfvIFvNxmlPooylRiMrdFiIrR1sZbyW7NHKTNsjUDzOsj6-lB6ePBW8RFRP08q6huy3bJGPwXJxza7K-g/output_znZoAX.gif)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 23, 2015 at 07:34PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1406906", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1407730"}
