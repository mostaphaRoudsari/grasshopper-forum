{"body": "\nHi Saeran,\n\nI agree with you at some points but disagree at others.\n\nI'll stat with the envelope. I want to get the volume that i can build without hurting solar rights of my neighbors (roughly speaking). Of course to build this volume you need the solar geometry (which is the technical part of the issue). But once you get this SG you must include for the final envelope the limits of your plot. I assume you are not allowed to build outside those limits. The solar geometry extends beyond these. This is my whole point. For the envelope will be easy to solve if you extrude your boundaries and intersect it with the solar geometry (the Envelope). Then you get what i said should be, which is the correct definition of Solar Envelope.\n\nAs for the Fan, it is about the same. If the solar geometry tilts towards the plot limits you are saying, theoretically, that your neighbor can build inside your plot since technically he wouldn't hurt your solar rights (i'm exaggerating a bit just to make my point). So you might be right that filling the gap is inaccurate (it is from the point of view of the solar geometry) but it will be correct as for the definition of Solar Fan respects ... which it is what you want to get. Unfortunately i don't know in this case what kind of operation is needed to fill the gap. Maybe the Substraction of the plot extrusion and the solar fan geometry and then the Union of this result with the Solar Fan geometry (2 operations).\n\n\n\nAttached a gh of my intent of showing my points and the way to solve. Not very elegant but ...\n\nDid i convince you? :-)\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1003236", "name": "solarFan_solarEnvelope_2_A.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 05, 2014 at 02:26AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1003092", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1003235"}
