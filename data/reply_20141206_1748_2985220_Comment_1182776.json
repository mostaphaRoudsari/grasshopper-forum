{"body": "\nHi Peter,\n\nI have tried to recreate Ale's error and I can't seem to do it either. \u00a0For now, let's take your, my, and Abraham's inability to replicate it as a sign that it happens rarely and can be fixed quickly\n\nI was not able to replicate your issue with closed geometry using the surface-by-surface method. \u00a0If it happens again, please send me the file. \u00a0In the meantime, I am going to be adding in some features to the ViewFactor component this weekend and it may be worth testing again after this new, suped-up version is complete.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 06, 2014 at 05:48PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182553", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182776"}
