{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI did daylight analysis simulation and the result is all with one color (picture attached), Someone knows why and could help me, please?\n\nWhen I try the simulation with an orthogonal room, it works. Has something that I could do to run with twist geometries?\n\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1636419", "name": "Daylight Analysis.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1636420", "name": "Simulation.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Camila Leone", "created_at": "November 9, 2016 at 5:03pm", "created_by": "CamilaLeone", "topic": "Daylight Analysis - This simulation didn't work to twist geometries?", "id": "topic_1636421"}
