{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThank you for all the help.\n\nThe views are parallel when I use the \"Ladybug_View from sun component\", I guess it makes sense that the view from the sun is set as a parallel view, as the sun can be considered to be infinitely far away.\n\nHowever, I am trying to make this work in my script using the \"Ladybug_Set the view\" component to set a normal view of my model. Even though I have an example file I don't really understand how the \"save views\" component works and what I need to connect as imput.\u00a0\n\nAttached is my file.[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ytz*1w0-YzDUpDFAHbUNynimukbawf*fNy598vw7Ke9SWDa7eJRiYUy4hSTrVuGznqQ9sFdNUrOzXQ10vTdqyB18heRjRerg/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ytz*1w0-YzDUpDFAHbUNynimukbawf*fNy598vw7Ke9SWDa7eJRiYUy4hSTrVuGznqQ9sFdNUrOzXQ10vTdqyB18heRjRerg/Capture.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1279795", "name": "save views Alejandro.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "May 04, 2015 at 03:42AM", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1267242", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279794"}
