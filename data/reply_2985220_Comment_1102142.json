{"body": "\nHi Dimitrios,\n\n\n\nIt is because Grasshopper mesh generates nonplanar surfaces. They will be considered in simulation. If you get so many of them then you probably want to generate the mesh yourself before using it for the analysis. If it is only for one or two then you can ignore it.\n\n\n\nI've recently modified the component to accept Grasshopper mesh setting so you can have a better control on meshing the geometry.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 14, 2014 at 5:51pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1102124", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1102142"}
