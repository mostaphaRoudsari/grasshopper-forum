{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\n\n\nNew to Ladybug + Honeybee. Was hoping to get some info to better understand what radiation calla lilies represent. I understand that they show radiation for the specified period of time and I understand the gradient. But what do the peaks and valleys represent in 3D? Why is there a hole in the middle? What relation does it have to its circular form?\n\n\n\nThanks for all your help!\n\n\n\n\n\nScott\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Scott Carncross", "created_at": "October 25, 2015 at 04:08PM", "created_by": "ScottCarncross", "topic": "Radiation Calla Lilies", "id": "topic_1385936"}
