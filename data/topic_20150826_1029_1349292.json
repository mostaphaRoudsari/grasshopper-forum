{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI am modeling a room to find out the best dimensions of the window in south elevation,\n\nPrincipally, in a specific WWR (window to wall ratio), There must be a balance between thermal energy and electric light, but in all conditions, the cooling load is much higher than heating and electric energy, I tested the algorithm for winter and again the cooling was higher than heating! I changed the materials but it was ineffective.\n\nWhat's the problem? Did I make mistake somewhere in writing the algorithm?\n\nThanks,\n\nFahimeh\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1349291", "name": "4-1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Fahimeh Motazedian", "created_at": "August 26, 2015 at 10:29AM", "created_by": "FahimehMotazedian", "topic": "Unusual High cooling loads", "id": "topic_1349292"}
