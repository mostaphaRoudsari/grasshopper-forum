{"body": "\nHi Agus,\n\n\n\nProblem just solved with the simulation, I updated the E+ component in the new file and runs fine! (me happy!) The problem with the EP construction though still remains sine the E+ component returns a warning that cannot find it in the library although if I do a EPConstruction decomposition I get back all the values I added to my new material!\n\n\n\nAny \u00a0ideas?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\nTasos\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 20, 2015 at 3:09am", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1227981", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228130"}
