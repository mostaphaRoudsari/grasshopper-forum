{"body": "\nHi Mostapha\n\n\n\nI had tried running the batch files - with limited success. And had uninstalled and reinstalled all Saturday a couple of weekends ago. Now this weekend I did ONE thing different and I seem to have a functioning Open Foam on Win 10. I ran the OpenFoam installer as Administrator. I had been running everything else as administrator. The illustrated picture is still an accurate picture of what happens at the start of the Open_Foam_Create powershell script..\n\nHowever, now running OF start and then Rhino/Grasshopper has a primitive script operating. Next step: create a GH operation that finds all the polygons in a GIS file, builds a grid of point over the refinement region at 1.5m from the terrain and extracts from the grid list all the points inside of or coincident with these GIS polygons..\n\nThanks again for your assistance. It was watching the youtube video again that triggered the 'did I run the OF installer as administrator?' doubt leading to the latest clean install\n\nM\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Michael Donn", "created_at": "April 29, 2017 at 11:52pm", "created_by": "MichaelDonn", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1739294", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1743036"}
