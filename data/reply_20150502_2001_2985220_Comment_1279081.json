{"body": "\nIn Rhino, there is automatically a direction set to every surface once you create it. \u00a0You can use the \"Dir\" command to see it. \u00a0We often try to reassign this in Honeybee if the normal is not facing outward of the zone. \u00a0Rhino will not reassign the normal when you trim or split but, if you merge a bunch of surfaces into a closed poly surface, all normals will automatically be assigned to face outward from the solid.\n\nI may not be remembering correctly whether E+ is auto-correcting the direction of the surface when it is not facing the right direction. \u00a0If it is auto-correcting, then you are right that this is not a big issue.\n\nGlad adjacent surfaces issue is resolved.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 02, 2015 at 08:01PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279214", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279081"}
