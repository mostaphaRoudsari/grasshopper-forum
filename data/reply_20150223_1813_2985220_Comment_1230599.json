{"body": "\nThank you Theodoros and Abraham, I flattened the inputs and assigned a zone name and that fixed the problem. I thought I'm going crazy.\n\nChris sorry for doubting the plug-in, I thought it had a bug. It turned out it is an awesome plug-in, it has everything I need for this project.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have two more questions:\n\n1- \u00a0Can I use \" conceptual shading using EC glazing in Energy Plus simulations? \u00a0and how do I setup that?\u00a0\n\n2- Do you have any videos posted that talk about daylighting simulations? or, it would be helpful if someone have a GH definition setup for daylighting workflow and can share the definition with me, I'm interested in DA and glare simulations. I'm currently using Diva, but I love the way HB provide clear and professional visualization.\u00a0\n\nRania\n\n\n\nRania\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "February 23, 2015 at 06:13PM", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "topic_1228741", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1230599"}
