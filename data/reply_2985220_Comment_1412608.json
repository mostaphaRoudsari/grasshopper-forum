{"body": "\nHi there,\n\nthanks for taking a look.\n\nI used to get different error messages, one of them about the transparency schedule not being found, even though it was saved in the right folder. I don't remeber what the other messages were about. At the moment, if\u00a0 I connect HB_context the simulation runs without producing an error message, however the Read_results components tell me \"1. The result file does not exist.\". I checked the folder they shoul be in and they really don't exist, which is no surprise, because the simulation runs suspiciously fast (2 minutes or so).\n\nI've also made up a new file with a somewhat simplified geometry and been playing around with the meshingSettings from the HBContext component as well es with the maximumFigure from the ShadowPar (at this point in my simulations I'm satisfied\u00a0 with relatively low-quality results). That one works fine, still takes a lot of time, sadly, but I guess there's just no way to get a really fast calculation for this kind of shading?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "S221B", "created_at": "December 1, 2015 at 6:04am", "created_by": "S221B", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412710", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412608"}
