{"body": "\nHi Mostapha\n\nSo this topic has recently come up again with colleagues and I just wanted to get your expert opinion. If we add in the last vector in the context of performing a solar access study I believe it is technically correct. For example, if we have an analysis period of 1hr but only 1 vector, it will assume that it gets sun for the full hour. If however we have 2 vectors, we can be sure that the sun is there for the full duration. I think this is clear.\n\n\n\nBut what complicates things is the legend and all subsequent workings. By adding in the extra vector as a workaround, we would get 2hrs max, not 1 hr. So until Ladybug X is released, do you suggest simply subtracting the step value (1hr) from the results and adjusting the legend? So 2 vector compliance would be 1 hr, and 1 vector compliance would be 0 hrs. Does that make sense?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul Wintour", "created_at": "September 4, 2016 at 7:00pm", "created_by": "PaulWintour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1586159", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1593923"}
