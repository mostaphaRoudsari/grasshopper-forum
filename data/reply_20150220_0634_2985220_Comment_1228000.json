{"body": "\n\n\nhi again,\n\n\n\nI was trying to overwrite some data with the .idf editor in E+ and I get this in result. Tried with both 8-1-0 and 8-2-0 but it doesnt seem to work. I used the 15/02/2015 E+ writer component to produce the .idf which still doesn't run when I input custom material. Any ideas? I really need to work with specific values on my material! Any ideas/ input would be great!\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nTasos\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1228001", "name": "Screen Shot 2015-02-20 at 14.31.13.png"}], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 20, 2015 at 06:34AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "topic_1227898", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228000"}
