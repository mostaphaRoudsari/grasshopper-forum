{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nIn the grid based analysis, is it the weather file direct and diffuse illuminance used to calculate the illuminance on the surface or the sky generated with the generate climate based sky uses other factors to calculate the illuminance?\n\n\n\nI am trying to do a parametric study on how different direct illuminance with same angle varies the illuminance in a space. But I get similar results for every simulation.\n\n\n\nI wouldn\u00b4t mind to use an annual DA simulation but it is a waste of time if I can get the simulation for just one hour.\n\n\n\nThank you for your replies!\n\n\n\nPedro\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1727285", "name": "psilluminancevariation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Pedro", "created_at": "April 04, 2017 at 11:12AM", "created_by": "Pedro987", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1471108", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1727283"}
