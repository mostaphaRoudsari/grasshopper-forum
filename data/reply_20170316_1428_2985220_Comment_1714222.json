{"body": "\nI think I figured out what my problem is. Since my data is uniform across seasons - even when the days are shorter, by using a cumulative sky across a 1 year period i am actually skewing my data, resulting in the weridness we see when I select an analysis period. I am not exactly sure what computations go into producing a cumulative sky, but if it is any sort of averaging I think this could be the problem!\n\nTo test this, is there a way that I can produce a cumulative sky for only a single month / week/ or even day?\n\n\n\nThank you to all who have been helping me along the way! Very grateful.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mike Johnson", "created_at": "March 16, 2017 at 02:28PM", "created_by": "MikeJohnson", "parent_id": "topic_1709991", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714222"}
