{"body": "\nHi Mathias,\n\n\n\nWe have been working on adding this functionality to Honeybee for a while. You can read about it [here](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/477) , [here](https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybee/issues/51),\u00a0[here](https://unmethours.com/question/16941/radiance-options-for-direct-sunlight-calculation/) and if you are familiar with rcontrib in Radiance, [here](https://unmethours.com/question/17201/rcontrib-misses-one-of-the-modifiers-if-number-of-modifiers-between-240-420/?comment=17658#post-id-17658).\n\n\n\nThere are essentially two aspects to implementing ASE:\n\n1. First, as you pointed out has to do with performance and being able to analyze larger number of illuminance grid points than currently possible.\n\n2. Second, which is probably more critical and the main bottleneck as far as implementation goes, has to do with the accuracy of Daysim. Just making the current Daysim engine work with ASE will result in erroneous simulations as Daysim overestimates the size of the sun (as compared to reality) by several orders of magnitude.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe implementation of ASE that we are working on currently will address both of the above issues. It should hopefully be available in this library: [https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybee](https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybee) sometime next month and will get ported over to Honeybee inside grasshopper after that.\n\n\n\nSarith\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "September 25, 2016 at 09:02PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1605466", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1605711"}
