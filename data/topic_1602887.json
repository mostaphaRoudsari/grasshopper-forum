{"body": "\nHey All looking to find the thermal comfort of multiple trees in courtyard space.\n\nBeen using Chris's awesome script\u00a0\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Trees_in_Outdoor_Thermal_Comfort&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1.0000000000000007&amp;offset=-16.800418538524298,3.315879883464021)\n\n\n\nIm a bit confused as to whether I can only use this on a single tree basis. I think I may be stressing my machine to the limit and it just will not compute. I've let it run for multiple hours. Any insights would be wonderful.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n\nGjergji\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Gjergjji Shkurti", "created_at": "September 20, 2016 at 6:51pm", "created_by": "GjergjjiShkurti", "topic": "Trees in Outdoor Thermal Comfort", "id": "topic_1602887"}
