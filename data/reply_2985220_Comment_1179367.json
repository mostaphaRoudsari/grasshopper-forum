{"body": "\nSure thing! I want to add two more things here which I couldn't do this afternoon:\n\n1. In case you are running the analysis for multiple zones, make sure that test points are separated in different branches for each zone (which will be the default unless you flatten the points), so when it comes to daysim Honeybee will generate a separate schedule for each zone.\n\n2. I tested the process in a class recently and it didn't work: ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/215](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/215)) I'm anxiously waiting for your test to tell me that was just an incident and not a bug! It used to work fine!\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 1, 2014 at 7:41pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1179411", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1179367"}
