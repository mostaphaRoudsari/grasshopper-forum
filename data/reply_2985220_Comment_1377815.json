{"body": "\nOK Anne.\n\nI've found a bug which is causing your file not to find the results. Also, even though you updated using the update component, there is one that needed to be reinserted (reColorMesh, see red group for the old and white for the new).\n\nThe bug is that the analysisType output of the LookupFolder_Daylighting component is giving an extra line with a \"%\" in it, while the same output from the runDaylightAnalysis is giving only one line. You can see in the yellow group the one conected to the right output and the one with the bad one.\n\nThis is a bug to report so Mostapha can fix it easily and quickly.\n\nI disconnected some of the Radparameters to save time, so you probably will connect them back.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1377816", "name": "Rdam_Energy_Daylight_05_error_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 12, 2015 at 12:17pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1377489", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1377815"}
