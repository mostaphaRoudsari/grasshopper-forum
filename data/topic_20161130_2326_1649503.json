{"body": "\nI haven't used LB/HB for a few weeks so it's quite a surprise for me to find that it wasn't working the way I expected.\n\n'Run Energy Simulation' in particular won't run.\n\n\n\nI think the problem has to do with the LB/HB components being placed in the wrong directory. If I remember correctly, it should be placed in the same directory sa Special Folders&gt;Components, instead it was randomly transferred (I have no idea why) to Special Folders&gt;User Objects.\n\n\n\nI've already experienced this problem with my laptop (which I eventually reformatted to fix a bunch of problems, including this).\n\n\n\nI've tried completely removing LB/HB then reinstalling it, it still places the components in the\u00a0Special Folders&gt;User Objects folder. (Also tried reinstalling Rhino, GH from scratch to no avail).\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/noNLDbauUJBCwAS1m5W*js8iOfOHOWNO6xxJFqQaJeD85Stu-oqnU3Szs4zWx-PCTVPWxV*BD-1RG9yYk25X3HNUWx1gH9cj/Screenshot4.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/noNLDbauUJBCwAS1m5W*js8iOfOHOWNO6xxJFqQaJeD85Stu-oqnU3Szs4zWx-PCTVPWxV*BD-1RG9yYk25X3HNUWx1gH9cj/Screenshot4.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/noNLDbauUJC8irtl4sU0BX5*eDLTXwV-tc1PfSIvLSitht7uT6YYWblStvENhSXqEnsx51QXWh3UvhfwaQlqc7UQ2bCZXmh5/Screenshot3.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/noNLDbauUJC8irtl4sU0BX5*eDLTXwV-tc1PfSIvLSitht7uT6YYWblStvENhSXqEnsx51QXWh3UvhfwaQlqc7UQ2bCZXmh5/Screenshot3.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pin", "created_at": "November 30, 2016 at 11:26PM", "created_by": "Pin", "topic": "LB/HB moved to the wrong directory, E+ simulation won't run.", "id": "topic_1649503"}
