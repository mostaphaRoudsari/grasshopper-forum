{"body": "\nHi Neil,\n\nThanks Chris. I think you are checking a different version of Honeybee_Honeybee. I tried to find the Honeybee version that you are using on Github ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/97ac6183bbf26da9c...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/97ac6183bbf26da9c4abdbfaee528e8ba4d41474/src/Honeybee_Honeybee.py#L475)) and the error shows that the component fails to create the folder for Honeybee.\n\nIt is an strange error as working directory for Ladybug and Honeybee should be the same. Can you try the attached file and see if the error is still happening on your system?\n\nThanks,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1184842", "name": "Honeybee_Honeybee_DEC_08.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 9, 2014 at 7:44pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184822", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184840"}
