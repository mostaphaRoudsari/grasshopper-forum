{"body": "\nHi Pin, very nice work with these components, I was looking into PCM-s lately as well, this makes it much easier than manually with \"additional strings\", and setting heatbalance algorithm.\n\n\n\nI noticed in your example, that your enthalpy values were very low, I think you meant kJ/kg, when the input is J/kg? (that is x1000 ) when I checked the required cooling, there was definitely about 5-7% change, depending on the phasechange C setpoint, with the values like 50000 J/kg at 20C\u00a0 etc , see\u00a0page 47 here:\u00a0 [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.460.5045&amp;a...;](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.460.5045&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)\n\nWhich version of honeybee&amp;ladybug did you use? I get error reports of version mismatch with 0.60 hb and 0.63 lb, if I try to add certain components.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland N\u00e9meth", "created_at": "May 03, 2017 at 06:55AM", "created_by": "RolandNemeth", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1664161", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1744876"}
