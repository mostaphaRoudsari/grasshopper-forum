{"body": "\nHi Ludvig,\n\nProblems similar to this have been studied before and there are a couple of solutions. You definitely don't want to go toward the random option. Back to the overlapping problem you can either merge the overlap windows or move them aside once they are overlapped and keep track of the distance from the base case as one of the objectives that you want to be minimized.\n\nDo you have any sketch of what you have in mind? and why there need to be 3 windows?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 31, 2016 at 05:19PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1451552", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1451287"}
