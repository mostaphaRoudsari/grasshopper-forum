{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for your replies! I tried the new Components! They now seem to work fine. The \"Solve Adjacencies\" component assigns Air Wall to both Walls and Floors now (which I think would be great to have as an option with the assignment of an integer as input, for example: \"1\" : Remove/assign to Horizontal surfaces \"2\" : Remove /assign to Vertical surfaces \"3\" : Remove/assign to both or something similar). As for the Daylight component, indeed you can now \"exportAirWalls\" or not, is this right Chris? Or you meant another component? In any case if I set this to False I get the expected results! Also there, a small note, the default is set to True although at the description says that the default is set to False. Non-sense detail but I just noticed!\n\n\n\nFinally for the \"Add InternalMass\" component the error I am getting whenever I re-open the gh file is that the Index is out of range which probably implies that the component keeps the information of the surfaces stored even if you run it again or something similar? And the warning I get is that some geometries are not Completely inside the zones which is also fixed once I drag n drop a new component on the canvas (for this one I am really puzzled!)! in Any case a new component solves both issues but still!\u00a0\n\n\n\nLast question probably not for this topic but very close. If I set the \"IsCondintioned\" from the Building2Masses component to True and then I set my conditions manually for each zone, is it overwritten or not? Or I should keep it to False and then assign condition my zones?\n\n\n\nThanks again for all your input!\n\n\n\nTasos\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "March 12, 2015 at 05:55AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240850", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1241151"}
