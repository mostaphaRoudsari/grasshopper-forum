{"body": "\nHi, Chris,\n\nThank you so much for your help! It is really great to see it is working! Another question: Why is cooling and total thermal is missing from the output in your image attached? Is it because the HVAC system I selected that doesn't cool the building at all?\n\n\n\nForgive me if I am asking some silly question, since I don't know much about energy model and MEP stuff. Just doing what my boss wanted me to do and experimenting.\n\n\n\nThank you for your kind reply!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zilong Tan", "created_at": "January 18, 2016 at 09:20AM", "created_by": "ZilongTan", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1438350", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1440986"}
