{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI've been struggling with this for a while, so i'm opening this discussion.\n\nI'm trying to get an Indoor map for a single zone in a building. I'm following the updated example (number 15).\n\nAttached a file with the issues i want to ask.\n\nI'm defining a zone from a rhino model. I've built. rebuild and rebuild this model since at the end of the line all the time i was getting an open brep as the HB_zone definition. I'm still getting this (See 1 in the file). But the E+ simulation runs. Just for checking i imported the idf file. In this case the zone is Closed (Weird. See 2 in file).\n\nAfter this simulation the IndoorViewFactor component is failing with either of those two warnings:\n\n1. When the input to the distFromFloor input is a panel i get this (see 3 in file):\n\n1. The distFromFloor_ is greater than the height of one or more of the zones.\n\nI remember that there was a problem when the zone was not on the ground, but it was fixed. So i don't understand the warning.\n\n2. When the same input is a slider i get this (see 4 in file):\n\n1. One of your continuous closed air volumes has an overlapping edge that is causing it to not read as a solid. <br/>\u00a0Bake the closedAirVolumes output and do a DupBorder command on the polysurface to see the buggy edge. <br/>\u00a0Rhino's solid operations are buggy. Hopefully McNeel fix this one soon.\n\nI cleaned the model from those overlapping edges, but still, is not working.\n\n\n\nAny words of wisdom?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1291168", "name": "AngelHouse.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 20, 2015 at 10:41pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "Open/Close Brep and IndoorViewFactor issue", "id": "topic_1291169"}
