{"body": "\nFarnaz,\u00a0\n\nWhile I have never seen the code behind therm I am almost sure they are also considering surface resistance to account for radiative and/or convective heat transfer.\n\n\n\nWhat you mentioned previously accounts for the thermal resistance in solid conduction through the width of the material. U = R^(-1).... R= L / lambda-solid ( per unit area - m^2 K / W)\n\nThe boundary conditions are likely being considered for convection and radiative transfer. Esentially the U-Value as used in the building industry is a coupling for:\n\nSolid Conduction = ( lambda-solid / Length )* (T1 -T2)\n\nRadiative Transfer = (1- reflectance) (irradiance) ... this is a simplification, it can get super complex\n\nConvective Transfer = hahaha I cannot remember this... but it's essentially (Tsurface - T1) / Convective Resistance.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI just want to reiterate that I am not certain of the calculations carried out in therm. However, I am confident that the U-value is a simplification that couples all thermal exchange mechanisms into the reciprocal of a single resistance. U = 1 / R-coupled.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\nMauricio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mauricio Aguilar Cardenas", "created_at": "May 10, 2016 at 04:26AM", "created_by": "MauricioAguilarCardenas135", "parent_id": "topic_1526788", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1527243"}
