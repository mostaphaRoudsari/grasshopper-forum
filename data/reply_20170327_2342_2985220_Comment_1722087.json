{"body": "\nHi Zhonghao,\n\n\n\nYou can deconstruct mesh on your analysis mesh and iterate over the faces. I believe that HB will assign values in the same order as the mesh face order.\n\n\n\nOf course some times GH's ordering is a bit weird and I'm having also issues with this in cases where I want everything to follow a specific direction, e.g. x1y1, x2y1, x3y1, ..., xny1, x1y2, x2y2, x3y2, ...., where x, y are the length and width of the mesh.\n\n\n\nI wonder if Mostapha/Chris have an idea on how we can rearrange this with native GH or how we can have HB manually setting the order in this structured way.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 27, 2017 at 11:42PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1721838", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1722087"}
