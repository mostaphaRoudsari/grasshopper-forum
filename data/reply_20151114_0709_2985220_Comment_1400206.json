{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI believe I fixed it, I deleted the master template idf file from C:\\ladybug and downloaded a new one from a thread here in the forum. The old one I deleted was a very small file and when i opened it with a text editor it was pretty empty. The new one seems fine. Thank you!\n\n\n\nJose\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jose Holguin", "created_at": "November 14, 2015 at 07:09AM", "created_by": "JoseRafaelHolguin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1400200", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1400206"}
