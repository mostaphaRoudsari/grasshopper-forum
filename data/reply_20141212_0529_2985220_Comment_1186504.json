{"body": "\nThanks and a lot of respect for your prompt help.\n\n\n\nBefore you fixed the \"schedules node\" I had to open the bloody input/output reference pdf which i found really easy to apply and fix the schedules manually.\n\nNow when I see how short and easy are the codes I want to propose you a wish list of \"AA SED programme\" so that later students would be able to use your honeybee tool more intensively.\n\nFirst of all, I want to clarify, what are the pressures when we specify the infiltration. That was still unclear for me as a beginner. Is it m3/m2s at 50Pa or at actual Pascal? If it is at actual Pascal, does that mean we should specify the concext somehow by the input of coefficients or by the actual bRep context or input it from some CFD? What do we do? What do you typically do?\n\n\n\nSecondly, I found an idf example which works with material substitution in energy plus example folders. I think this is something what Chris was trying to propose. The code seems short. Can we expect that this feature of material replacement according to the schedule would appear later?\n\n\n\nOther passive elements like trombe wall for instance would be appreciated as well.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI see you are now focused more on high/light tech tools, but don't forget about low tech vernacular strategies.\n\n\n\nMany thanks again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Artem Polomanyy", "created_at": "December 12, 2014 at 05:29AM", "created_by": "ArtemPolomanyy", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1277124", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1186504"}
