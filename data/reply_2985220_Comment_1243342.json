{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nI am sorry but it doesn't work also in this way. Before I was grafting directly in the lightingControlGroup_ input but the result is the same, when grafting (in any way) only the first lightingControlGroup is reported in the Daysim report.\n\n\n\nOne main doubt I have is: when we use the lighting control groups should the _testPoints of the \u00a0Honeybee_Read Annual Result I component be branched in the same order like the sensor points of each lighting control group? Actually I believe not because on the test points are given the main results about daylight availability and autonomy of Daysim and if we use smaller groups of point we will not have anymore general results for the entire room but many for the single zones.\n\n\n\nTo explain better: I have one large retail shop for which I am testing the daylighting autonomy and electric lighting saving given by skylights. I use one single (total of 1812) list for the test points then I subdivide the hall in 5 (before were 3) lighting zones so the sensor points are the same of the test points but divided in 5 separate groups. That is to say I am working with one single zone but asking 5 different lighting control groups in it. is it possible?\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "March 16, 2015 at 4:53am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1243155", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1243342"}
