{"body": "\nHi Chris and Sarith,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for your replies. As I told you before, V-ray for 3D MAX can simulate a full spectrum\u00a0light analysis. Grasshopper as a parametric software can understand angles and equations which are unfortunately\u00a0not applicable with 3D MAX.\u00a0\n\n3D MAX can only visualize the spectrum light with no specified\u00a0angle or pre-scripting, just you can move the light manually till you get reflected and refracted light.\u00a0\n\nI think it would be really helpful to make a V-ray for Honeybee (RADIANCE), so we can use V-ray parametrically! \u00a0 Do you think it is possible to merge the two software? \u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nAhmad\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ahmad Eltaweel", "created_at": "May 19, 2017 at 4:51am", "created_by": "AhmadEltaweel", "parent_id": "topic_1752950", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1753998"}
