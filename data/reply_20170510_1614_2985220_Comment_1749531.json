{"body": "\nReid and Abraham,\n\nWe weren't planning to support a conditionalStatment input on the \"SelectSkyMtx\" component until the release of Ladybug[+] but you can use the following workaround with the current Ladybug to apply a kind of conditional statement to your radiation analyses:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/6AU-dFpd9S6MzLN6DJtGyaYT5DXjSIzLgHnPBoP8FtxzZTE6vHamATHZTgTjAhg*5tql7Y9hZq-6829mbaP5Q9G1b5N79PNB/RadiationConditionalStatement.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/6AU-dFpd9S6MzLN6DJtGyaYT5DXjSIzLgHnPBoP8FtxzZTE6vHamATHZTgTjAhg*5tql7Y9hZq-6829mbaP5Q9G1b5N79PNB/RadiationConditionalStatement.JPG)\n\nThe \"SelectSkyMtx\" component will only use radiation from the hours of the year (HOYs) that are input into it. \u00a0So the example above effectively builds a sky radiation dome that is just for hours of the year when the dry bulb temperature is above 15 C.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1749533", "name": "RadaitionConditionalStatement.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 04:14PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749522", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749531"}
