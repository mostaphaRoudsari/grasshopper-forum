{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI see that the output of the LB_Sunpath:selHourlyData is missing header and contains only the data for \"light\" hours.\n\nOn the other side the LB_ComfortShadeBenefit:_temperatures hint asks for connecting this data while in the example\u00a0OutdoorShadeBenefitEvaluation this input is connected with the LB_OutdoorComfortCalculator:UTCI which has aheader and the whole range of hours.\n\nSo it will be correct to assume that the first case is not valid anymore (closing this discussion, and the hint should be updated)? Or there is a bug?\n\n\n\nThanks and happy holidays ...\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 21, 2014 at 1:01am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1190658", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1192299"}
