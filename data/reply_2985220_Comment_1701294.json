{"body": "\nThank you for the testing Abraham! These comparisons are really useful!!\n\n<br/>I've never used BioMet, but by looking at [their webpage](http://www.model.envi-met.com/hg2e/doku.php?id=apps:biomet), there seem to be some default parameters: like clothes thermal insulation of 0.9 clo and maybe metabolic rate of: 164.49 W/m2.<br/>If this is the case, then Ladybug \"Body characteristics\" inputs: **clothingInsulation_** and **metabolicRate_** need to be set to these values as well: 0.9 and 2.826 mets (=164.49 W/m2):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UNdbGkqHoSotFe3sAjNKJh*tUi*pqi5otVoXlXkCDMeqRawgEsAoRnQMQSBqMNa-rqsCHJoH10UZyxrsQrvDnN2XwZrT8gqq/clothesInsulation_metabolicRate.jpg?width=100\" width=\"100\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UNdbGkqHoSotFe3sAjNKJh*tUi*pqi5otVoXlXkCDMeqRawgEsAoRnQMQSBqMNa-rqsCHJoH10UZyxrsQrvDnN2XwZrT8gqq/clothesInsulation_metabolicRate.jpg)\n\n\n\nWhat i WISH now in the LB_ENVImet is importing also the vegetation from EM. For the case in the image there are a \"lot\" of trees affecting the PET which are not in the imported model. Without them is sometimes difficult to explain the results.\n\nI will check Antonello's reply on this.\n\nBut I wonder why these vegetation models are not even present in the BioMet example?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "February 27, 2017 at 8:08am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701206", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1701294"}
