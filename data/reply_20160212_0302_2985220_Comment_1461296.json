{"body": "\nYeah, hehe...I was playing around with extreme numbers to simulate a Dynamic U-value in Walls. Idea is, instead of venting the room maybe changing the walls to have a higher heat transmission and therefore lose heat. Since EP doesn't allow one hour sims I am setting the original U-value to have a high heat exchange and conditioning the building to obtain internal air temperature matching the results of a low U-value envelope...then when I test cooling I just assign the cooling and heating set point to 500,-500.\u00a0\n\nI was actually wondering, and you probably know if this is possible, if I can suspend EP threads(mid simulation), change the U-values and then resume the threads.???\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mauricio Aguilar Cardenas", "created_at": "February 12, 2016 at 03:02AM", "created_by": "MauricioAguilarCardenas135", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1461005", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1461296"}
