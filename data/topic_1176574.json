{"body": "\nHi LB and HB devs and experts.\n\nI have some questions regarding setting up ventilation systems in HB.\n\nPlease see the Grasshopper file to understand the questions properly.\n\nThe questions are grouped\u00a0by a green blob.\n\n\n\n1) Question 1. Changing my **ventilationPerArea** does not affect my thermal environment why?\u00a0\n\n2)\u00a0Question 2. How do I define my own schedules? for heating and cooling set point schedules specifically.\n\n3) Question 3.\u00a0How do I define my system (heating and cooling) capacities is it possible?\n\n4)\u00a0Question 4. It seems like Adiabatic Surface proprieties disappear when written to EP. Am I doing something wrong?\n\n\n\nBest Regards\n\nKristoffer\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1176573", "name": "testRoomQ.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Kristoffer Negendahl", "created_at": "November 27, 2014 at 4:59am", "created_by": "KristofferNegendahl", "topic": "Questions about schedules and system capacities", "id": "topic_1176574"}
