{"body": "\nThanks, is there a way to comment on bugs on GitHub? I tried to sign up there, but then I noticed the subscription plans, so I assumed it wasn't free. I feel that creating a discussion for each bug is a bit of an overkill.\n\n\n\nI love the work you guys are doing, and can't wait for butterfly, oh boy having a CFD here will be a blessing. Anyway, thank you for you time and sorry for an overkill with the bugs.\n\nCheers.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "November 28, 2015 at 7:37am", "created_by": "Timur582", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1411173", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1411085"}
