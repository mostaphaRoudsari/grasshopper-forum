{"body": "\nHi Daniel, I have a draft email (now probably for months) to send to Arthur and ask him if he is interested in some sort of collaboration but I haven't sent it out, waiting for a time that I feel confident that I can follow up with him on a timely manner. Do you know him? and have you talked to him about this?
