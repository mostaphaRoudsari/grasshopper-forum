{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\n\n\nI have set-up and ran annual simulations for 360 zones with Honeybee with no problem but there are couple of considerations in how you put the model together when you are dealing with so many zones. I can't check your file right now but I hope I can get back to this during the weekend.\n\n\n\nin Energy simulation each time-step is effected by previous time-step so technically what you are thinking about is not a good idea. On the other hand there are part of energy simulation that can be ran in parallel. EnergyPlus started to use parallel cores at some point but then they stopped it for some technical reasons. You can search EnergyPlus email list for more information.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 12, 2015 at 9:23pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1223055", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223849"}
