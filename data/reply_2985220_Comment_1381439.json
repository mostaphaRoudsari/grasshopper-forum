{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you for this, however the batch files for each idf are only generated once you run an E+ simulation - at least in my case anyway. If you just ask Honeybee to write the idf but not run them, then only an idf is generated.\n\n\n\nI want to be able to create a bunch of idfs and then simulate them all in parallel...\n\nI noticed that the writeBatchFile coding is under the RunIdf definitions within the component, can this be moved to happen when you write the idf instead? (in the process of learning python myself...)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "October 18, 2015 at 6:25pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1380006", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1381439"}
