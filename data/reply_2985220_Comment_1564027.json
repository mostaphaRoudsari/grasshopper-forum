{"body": "\nHi Filippo,\n\nThis is an issue with Rhino installation. Your installation is missing rhinoscriptsyntax file. I would open a new discussion under errors and bugs and ask what is the solution to get installation fixed for rhinoscriptsyntax.py.\n\nLadybug + Honeybee doesn't have anything to do with\u00a0rhinoscriptsyntax installation itself.
