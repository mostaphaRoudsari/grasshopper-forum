{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI follow your reasoning but am still running into an issue. I expect the kWh/m2*sr numbers to be smooth, as you describe. When I try to derive these numbers from the output values by dividing by the corresponding sr values, the discontinuous bands still exist. Take the 2nd and 3rd patch from the bottom shown in the images below. I expect the kWh/sr\u00a0values here to be nearly identical.\u00a0 The sr\u00a0quantities vary by 3%\u00a0but the\u00a0kWh values vary by\u00a0almost 40%. Plotting the kWh/sr values shows that the banding still exists. This makes sense considering similarly sized patches have\u00a0sharp color changes\u00a0between them.\u00a0This seems wrong to me. If you are getting the correct numbers by changing the sr values to 1 inside the script, perhaps there is an issue with the math that generates the output values? Let me know what you think. I have attached my gh file for you to look at.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pCnj1SuHrlry-f0KHO3Jw97FNnXVrElIU0cH6EHFUoLIKg7qjUvNpAVA1xWtyWJzJvDTY1*HSj9u2XqQqemXC-uKWt1nBFMe/kWhpersr.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pCnj1SuHrlry-f0KHO3Jw97FNnXVrElIU0cH6EHFUoLIKg7qjUvNpAVA1xWtyWJzJvDTY1*HSj9u2XqQqemXC-uKWt1nBFMe/kWhpersr.jpg)\n\n\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pCnj1SuHrloJESbnu9fWNhxLeOI8OS7hNPapgLOrg8uhQ0qhrfXw2ntBpspouUMw6CNzahSEfcRXV1lBzdyuF9zGN0TfYD7J/kWh.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pCnj1SuHrloJESbnu9fWNhxLeOI8OS7hNPapgLOrg8uhQ0qhrfXw2ntBpspouUMw6CNzahSEfcRXV1lBzdyuF9zGN0TfYD7J/kWh.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1200558", "name": "cumulativeSkyMtx error.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "January 07, 2015 at 12:50PM", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1200050", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1200557"}
