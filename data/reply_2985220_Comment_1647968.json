{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nI'm here have a question about slat angle of dynamic shading in grasshopper. From the Daysim page, it says that when the illuminance at the control sensor rises beyond a user specified threshold, the system automatically readjusts the shading system to the next lower setting. I just assume i have two shading state one is from 200-2000 lux and the higher state is from 2000-3000 lux. Do you know what's slat angle of the horizontal blinds within the first range (200-2000) and the second (2000-3000)? And how low the angle can be? Does fully closed state means block any lighting rays which is not really beneficial for daylight level?\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nTracy\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tracy", "created_at": "November 28, 2016 at 11:54pm", "created_by": "Tracy266", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1720578", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647968"}
