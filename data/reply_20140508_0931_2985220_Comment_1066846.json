{"body": "\nHi Claudio. This is a known bug ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/20](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/20)). It hasn't been really implemented. Sorry! :)\n\nFor now you need to rotate the geometry itself. I will fix this soon. I'm thinking to remove the north input from runDaylight and add it to sky components. I'm not sure yet.\n\n-Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 08, 2014 at 09:31AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1066843", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1066846"}
