{"body": "\nHello guys,\n\n\n\nFirst of all congrats on the new version, I am really excited to test the new indoor comfort tools\n\n\n\nHowever, this time I'd like to do it on an actual project. I am trying to design an office tower and split the mass into zones. I keep getting the following message:\n\n\n\n\"Failed to generate the perimeter zones for one floor as the floor's geometry is not accomodated by the script. the floor will be returned as a single zone.\"\n\n\n\nNow, I understand this is a bit of a funky shape, so I tried the same design without any curved surfaces. Still the same error. I seem to remember more difficult spaces in Chris's example to be used with no issues. Is there a way around this?\n\n\n\nI am attaching the definition.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1216864", "name": "OfficeTower.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 3, 2015 at 11:15pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Splitting Masses into Zones", "id": "topic_1216865"}
