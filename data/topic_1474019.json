I have attached the definition, it's a little hectic but I am going with it one level and one piece at a time.\n\n\n\nAlso checked: the missing floors are seen as ground floor and the missing roofs are seen as ceilings - so how do I properly change this?\u00a0\n\nAny suggestions are welcomed.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1474018", "name": "ground floor functions.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Stefania Dinea", "created_at": "February 29, 2016 at 5:31am", "created_by": "StefaniaDinea", "topic": "Solve Adjacencies error", "id": "topic_1474019"}
