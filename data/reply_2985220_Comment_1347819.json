{"body": "\nArie,\n\nGlad to be of help and keep us posted.\n\nI will say that, from my own experience (both in simulation and in the real-world), it is very difficult to be comfortable when sitting in direct sun. \u00a0If you are indoors, direct sun will almost certainly make you feel too hot and it is really only in cold outdoor conditions that the sun really starts to become desirable. \u00a0The only times that I have ever seen direct sun making the indoors comfortable is around sunrise on winter mornings, when the solar radiation is not too intense and the indoor temperature tends to be cold enough to make the sun seem desirable.\n\nThe other major reason why direct sun is usually uncomfortable is glare, which you will (almost certainly) have in any case of direct sun unless you are wearing sun glasses or keeping your head down looking at a (non-reflective) ground. \u00a0It may be worthwhile to run some Honeybee glare simulations in order to understand how this will affect your specific case.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 23, 2015 at 1:46pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1347037", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1347819"}
