{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\n\nThank you so much for your help. I've watched Mostafa's videos, I think they are a little hard to follow mainly because the video were targeting a live workshop audience and not online audience. I think I got the daylighting workflow, I have good background in daylighting simulations.\n\nI have a question for you\u00a0\n\nDo you think daysim will be able to handle a Radiance material that has BTRD function, such as this one that I created using optics6\n\nHere is an example material created by Optics 5\n\n\n\nvoid glass Solarglaze 70 DS_glass<br/>0<br/>0<br/>3 0.670 0.713 0.688\n\nvoid BRTDfunc Solarglaze 70 DS_front<br/>10<br/>0.094 0.095 0.093<br/>0.615 0.654 0.631<br/>0 0 0<br/>.<br/>0<br/>9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nvoid BRTDfunc Solarglaze 70 DS_back<br/>10<br/>0.104 0.105 0.101<br/>0.615 0.654 0.631<br/>0 0 0<br/>.<br/>0<br/>9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\nI have another question, about the EC glazing, I would like to setup Honeybee so that when window surface temperature becomes larger than a specific value the glass changes to tinted one with low transmissivity , how do I go about that? can this be accomplished by setting up a schedule?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nRania\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "February 25, 2015 at 08:55PM", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1230608", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1231802"}
