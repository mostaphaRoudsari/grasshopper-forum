{"body": "\nSalut Julien,\n\n\n\nI managed to open your osm file in OpenStudio and got it running the simulation. As the progress bar wasn't growing I stopped it and then checked the err file. I figured out that there are many floors and roofs upside down (you better check the normal on these surfaces), many non-planar surfaces and many errors about wrong solar distribution (you should use FullExterior with non-convex zones, as you have a couple of l-shaped rooms). Please see the file attached.\n\nI then opened your gh file and found a couple of brep missing (CenterWalkwayRoofRightSmall, the grazing surface of\u00a0RightWingWalkway-Roof) and many of your zones recognized as open breps (see the HB Create Zone outputs) because you missed some walls: check the input geometries.\n\nI hope I have been of help to you.\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1250122", "name": "eplusout.err"}], "created_by_name": "Jacopo Sartore", "created_at": "March 25, 2015 at 9:00am", "created_by": "JacopoSartore", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1249456", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1250120"}
