{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\n\nI looked a bit at this and it puzzled me too, there might be a bug here. <br/><br/>Since you have sent me the Rhinofile, which is not posted here, I could recreate the problem. But I can only recreate the problem in this rhinofile, not when running the script you posted here without the accompanying geometry (btw the script you posted here lacks some geometry.. ;) <br/><br/>\n\nYou had built your geometry 60 kilometers from the origin point. This might be a cause for the bug, but correcting this in rhino did not do the trick either.\n\n\n\nIn the attached rhinofile, it seems the solve adjacencies works fine when the smaller surfaces of a box are aligned, not when the larger surfaces are.\n\nI posted the file here if anyone is interested to look closer at it, otherwise I would recommend rebuilding the rhinofile. Copy only your geometry to a new file and see if it works.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1467757", "name": "problemwithadjacency 2.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1467758", "name": "Problemswithadjacency 2.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "February 20, 2016 at 06:02PM", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1467732", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1467755"}
