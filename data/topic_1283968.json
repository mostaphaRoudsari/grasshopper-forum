{"body": "\nHey everyone,\n\n\n\nI have been dabbing with OS and Honeybee lately (thanks for the amazing videos!) and I have a quite simple, rookie, question.\n\n\n\nWill OS components override the settings provided during the designing of HB zones in the previous steps? For now, I've been dragging my zones from the solve adjacencies component to OS and then setting the HVAC options. Should I split the zones into multiple OS components to handle AC zones, NV zones, MV zones, etc.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 10, 2015 at 10:00pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Honeybee and OpenStudio interface - interactions and parameter settings during an E+ simulation", "id": "topic_1283968"}
