I need to block the sun from mid march to mid September from 12 to 4 pm. Sunpath generates 600 vectors SHDDesigner components generates 2400 srfs based on 0.56m distance between them. Is this normal? The Gh file becomes super slow.\n\n\n\nthank you all\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "July 21, 2014 at 09:07PM", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "SHD Designer generating thousands of surfaces", "id": "topic_1104498"}
