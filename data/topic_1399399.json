{"body": "\nHi, I have two questions:\n\n\n\n1. Can I use EnergyPlus Version 7.2 with honeybee ? If there is something that forces Honeybee to use the latest version of EnergyPlus can I disable that and use 7.2.\n\n\n\n2. Secondly, is it possible to color different zones according to the energy consumed for cooling annually ?\n\n\n\nThanks,<br/> Sarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "November 12, 2015 at 7:06pm", "created_by": "sarith", "topic": "Using old version of EnergyPlus and Coloring zones by energy consumption", "id": "topic_1399399"}
