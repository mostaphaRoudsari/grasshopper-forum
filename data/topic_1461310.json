{"body": "\nHi all,\n\ni am trying to create a sunspace in front of a living room, as in the attached script (internalised geometries). I made it into two convex zones, one for the sunspace and one for the adjacent living room. The results i get show zero solar gains for the living room. I have deliberately oriented it towards south and i have designed large windows, so i think something is wrong regarding the direct solar component. Any advice would be most appreciated,\u00a0\n\nthank you!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1461009", "name": "Livingroomsunspace.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Iason Bournas", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 4:20pm", "created_by": "IasonBournas", "topic": "No solar gains through interior window", "id": "topic_1461310"}
