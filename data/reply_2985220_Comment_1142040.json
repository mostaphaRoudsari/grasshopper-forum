{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nIm trying to use this plug-in but the weather station website you use does not have my current location which is Edinburgh, United Kingdom. Is it possible to get data from another website? or what would be my options in such a scenario since the locations included are not close to me.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMira\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mira Al-Suradi", "created_at": "October 3, 2014 at 4:05am", "created_by": "MiraAlSuradi", "parent_id": "topic_1139404", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1142040"}
