{"body": "\nHello people.\n\nHave a quick question.\n\nWhen you \"prepare geometry\", how do you generate windows?\n\nI started my journey into HB with Chris's tutorials first, where he keep surfaces untouched and just create windows as coplanar surfaces where he needs.\n\nThen I saw Mostapha's \"punching\" method and got a bit confused. Is there any difference or it is just a matter of one's approach?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/tUpf1dE*xKYOX2ZESlcz*RhcI4WPb6Ax1tYj6QQb7-*HgqxN7wdwPsyDLhNTFZ9E0flsIMo*S5Zk28jDFO4ZRtMY3YeRD-AE/Capture.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com/files/tUpf1dE*xKYOX2ZESlcz*RhcI4WPb6Ax1tYj6QQb7-*HgqxN7wdwPsyDLhNTFZ9E0flsIMo*S5Zk28jDFO4ZRtMY3YeRD-AE/Capture.PNG)\n\nBoth ways seem to give same results, can you comment on this? I'd like to go Chris's minimalistic way but want to be sure there are no caveats.\n\nThanks.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "February 25, 2016 at 10:08pm", "created_by": "Timur582", "topic": "Punched-out or Coplanar Windows?", "id": "topic_1471752"}
