{"body": "\nHi Chenyang,\n\n\n\nIf you want to examine the energy benefits of a green roof in the interior then create a construction material with the same U value (and other values whose influence you want to test) as this of the green roof you are planning to use. If you want to elaborate more then try to create different layers with values reflecting the values of the layers that form your green roof. If you want to examine benefits related to the exterior environment like heat-islands or comfort then the simulation of a green roof must done with another level of detail which I don't really know. Regarding the interior though I have already used these solutions and work pretty accurately!\u00a0\n\n\n\nHope it helps!\n\n\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "March 10, 2015 at 5:54pm", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "topic_1239909", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240177"}
