{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nComparing same radiation analysis for an interior working plane with LB and HB, in order to understand the spectrum of different values for those type of analysis with the two methods.\n\n\n\nSame geometry, same date and time.\n\n\n\nHB gives almost half of the values.\n\n\n\nIs that something expected because HB takes into consideration defuse light and materials?\n\n\n\nAlso I noticed the LB_Colored_Sky_Visualizer legend shows wrong date, as the input is the 21st.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDimitris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183676", "name": "Results_Comparison.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183677", "name": "Radiation_Analysis_LB_01.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183678", "name": "Grid_Based_Day_Analysis_HB_02.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "December 08, 2014 at 02:53PM", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "HB vs LB Radiation Analysis results comparison", "id": "topic_1183679"}
