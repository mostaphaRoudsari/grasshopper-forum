{"body": "\nI see... That happens because of the same issue. Honeybee tries to download the material files to c:\\ladybug but it fails. That 'Download complete!' message is a lie! ;)\n\nIf you copy this file to c:\\ladybug manually ([https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16228160/honeybee/OpenStudioMas...](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16228160/honeybee/OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf)) and re-open the file the error should go away for Honeybee_Honeybee but you will still have issues since other components also use the same folder! :|\n\nI will get this fix this by Sunday and let you know. Sorry for all the troubles you have been through and thank you for letting me know. [We will get it fixed soon](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/15). :)\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 14, 2014 at 11:01am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1026131", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1025970"}
