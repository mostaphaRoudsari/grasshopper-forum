{"body": "\nAwkweird,\n\nSorry for getting back so late and I think that I may have identified the problem. \u00a0What service release (SR) of Rhino are you using? (Go to the Rhino window's Help &gt; About Rhinoceros and check the number that comes after \"Version 5 SR\" in the window that pops up). \u00a0It seems that the Rhinocommon \"Split Brep\" function is not working on your system and this is one.\n\nTo provide a temporary fix, I have put in an extra check that should correct the problem in most cases (the worst case now should be that you get some parts of a mesh that are showing you outdoor conditions). \u00a0Please let me know if the attached file works. As you can see, it is fine on my system and I internalized a mesh in the GH file with what the final comfort map should look like.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/EWMw8iXl*iXanpBCmUs*qzdikLJdz6oy9wRFi3AhnV5syZSkKIhfBvETTG*yJToK72Y*rS564wc8xFEspWx5GJYXN0Xtz4Yl/ComfortMapWorking.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/EWMw8iXl*iXanpBCmUs*qzdikLJdz6oy9wRFi3AhnV5syZSkKIhfBvETTG*yJToK72Y*rS564wc8xFEspWx5GJYXN0Xtz4Yl/ComfortMapWorking.JPG)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1288824", "name": "Honeybee_issue_2015_05_01CWM2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 17, 2015 at 3:28pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279504", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1288823"}
