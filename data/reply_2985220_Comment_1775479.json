{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\n\n\nThank you for your immediate reply. And sorry for my fault uploaded gh file.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt was so emergency that I could not clarify my issue. I tended to calculated the energy performance of a mass roof with solar panels attached above. You can check the gh file below to see the details.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe question is when I connected the HBGeneration and HBContext to Run E+ component, the result was always short of lighting output. This problem would never happen when the model was simple as a box.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf there existed any operation errors by myself, please let me know. Thank you in advance.\n\n\n\nXiaojian\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1775481", "name": "1 problem.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "June 28, 2017 at 1:09am", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1775284", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1775479"}
