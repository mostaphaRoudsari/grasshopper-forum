{"body": "Hi Mostapha,\n\nI have been experimenting with Designexplorer myself. As with Pollinator results work fine but i cannot get it to read my image and jason files. I am using a dropbox folder (tried also woth Box) but doesnt seem to work. Is weird since when i change the links manually in my Csv with the links you have in your example it works fine. I inspected the page using Chrome and noticed that you have the links also as a preset there.Not sure though if this happens because i try to upload a file over the existing example or is due to the initial code( i am not at all familiar with the code behind web pages) Any ideas why does this happen? The structure of the csv is exactly the same as the one in the csvs you can download from the link you have above!\n\nGreat work in any case!\n\nThanks\nTasos", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "December 11, 2015 at 01:04AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "topic_1417543", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1419537"}
