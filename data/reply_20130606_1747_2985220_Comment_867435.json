{"body": "\nMichal is right about the parallel option.\n\nFor the optimization though, if you are using Galapagos (which is a single-objective solver) I'm curious to know why are you calculating the result separately for each skin? I assume you add up the result into a single number. If that is the case you can connect all the geometries to geometry and leave the context input.\n\nYou may also want to try Octopus ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/octopus](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/octopus)) and solve it as a multi-objective problem.\n\nApparently you are intensively using the bug these days! That's pretty cool. :) As I said if you want to fully enjoy the use of parallel option let me know to send you a newer version for test.\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 06, 2013 at 05:47PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_866454", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_867435"}
