{"body": "\nHeyhey,\n\n\n\nFirst-off, thank you for all the work you've put into this! HB&amp;LB are amazing plug-ins :)\n\n\n\nNow for the problem:\n\nI've been working on some energy and daylight models. I have run the same model a couple of days back and it worked perfectly, but now it just will not run (completely). There are no problems with the energy part - except that sometimes the material is not loaded into the library on the first run.\n\nFor daylighting however, I'm getting multiple errors:\n\n1.\u00a0Solution exception:index out of range: 0 When I connect a panel, it says it traces back to line 320.\n\n2. What's also new is that the cmd gets stuck. Almost like it pauses, while previously the daylight simulation would run in seconds.\n\n\n\nI've updated the components with the update component, and I have also ran the batch files after adding 'pause' to the files, but not much happened there either.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHope you can help me, thanks for your time :)\n\n\n\nAnne\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1377628", "name": "Rdam_Energy_Daylight_05_error.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1377629", "name": "DF.zip"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1377604", "name": "Capture.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Anne Leeuw", "created_at": "October 12, 2015 at 08:13AM", "created_by": "AnneLeeuw", "topic": "daylight analysis - index out of range & frozen/stuck cmd", "id": "topic_1377630"}
