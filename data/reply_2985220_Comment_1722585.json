{"body": "\nThank you Abraham,\n\n\n\nUnfortunately when I change the values of the csv files thanks to Excel and put the data like it was (, for between numbers) it didn't work. The error from the Honeybee_Visualize Microclimate Map is this time \"**Solution exception:index out of range: 0\"**. But with the origin csv it works fine.\n\n\n\nDo you know why there is this error ?\n\n\n\nI thought to create a new csv file thanks to Honeybee_Create CSV Schedule. But I have this error (the Python Script Editor multiplies the radTempMtx per 2) :\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1722587", "name": "ghp.png"}], "created_by_name": "Mehdi HAMDANI", "created_at": "March 28, 2017 at 8:58am", "created_by": "MehdiHAMDANI", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1722749", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1722585"}
