{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nAs crazy as those numbers seem, they are accurate. \u00a0Remember that this number is not surface temperature but is the perceived radiant temperature of the sun from the perspective of the person.\n\nAs a point of comparison, imagine taking a thermal camera and pointing it at the sun. \u00a0The camera is probably going to give you incredibly high values in excess of 100C and it is this value that is being measured here.\n\nThe perceived radiant temperature delta only reaches 130C for a very small portion of the mannequins body (where the camera is pointing directly at the sun), and over the whole person, it's only about an increase of 42 C at noon on the winter solstice (when the sun is most perpendicular to the standing person and the most radiation falls on the body). \u00a0Considering that radiant temperature is only half of the total perceived temperature and the air accounts for the other half, the sun is really only helping the person feel about 21C warmer. \u00a0So, really all that this is saying is that a person standing outside in 0C weather at noon on the solstice will probably feel fine if they stand in direct sun since this will cause them to experience a total perceived temperature of about 21C. \u00a0Let me know if this makes sense.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 10, 2014 at 6:21pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1165914", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1165961"}
