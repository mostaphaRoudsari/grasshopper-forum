{"body": "\nSo, when I apply ladybug to a very simple/continuous form/surface I'm able to get good results but now I'm trying to apply it to a more complicated model and I'm having trouble simplifying the mesh enough for ladybug to function correctly, otherwise I just get a bunch of scattered test points and results (See attached images). So I guess I'm trying to simplify the model's mesh so that the test points are applied uniformly to generate more accurate results.\n\nAny suggestions would be great! Thanks.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1101888", "name": "Image 1.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1101889", "name": "Image 2.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Justin", "created_at": "July 14, 2014 at 2:57pm", "created_by": "Justin950", "topic": "How to simplify model for Ladybug analysis?", "id": "topic_1101890"}
