In a sense the grond is the geometry and the buildings are the context.\n\n\n\nAny help on troubleshooting this would be appreciated!\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1775342", "name": "DTLA_Master_MV_ladybug_edit_03.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1775343", "name": "radition_analysis_01.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1775344", "name": "USA_CA_Los.Angeles.Downtown.722874_CTZ2010.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Ryan", "created_at": "June 27, 2017 at 2:30pm", "created_by": "Ryan783", "topic": "Radiation Analysis Issue", "id": "topic_1775345"}
