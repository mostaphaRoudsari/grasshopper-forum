{"body": "\nHi Paul,\n\nThis is one of my favorite topics actually. I have changed this couple of time and still I'm not sure if it is the best solution. The last hour is not intended to be there.\n\nSo here is the concept. Let's say you want to generate sun vectors for working hours. Let's say that people are working in an office \u00a0from 8 to 17. It means they will leave at 5pm so the data for hour 5 shouldn't be generated. Does it make any sense to you! I tried to match Ladybug sunpath with daysim logic but I agree that it's not what comes to mind first when you hear 8 to 5.\n\nMostapha\n\nPS: I like the time-saving component up there. How do you deal with the cutting hour?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 12, 2015 at 3:54pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1202845", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1203520"}
