{"body": "\nI've been using Ladybug View Analysis to determine whether a feature within a city (like the Space Needle in Seattle) is visible from points on a building, like so:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"287\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Uf5Jdma8M30SapC2U-ZrdnzV0tupo6ylAmQYwTqH-Smu0nvv0-r1pPmw0xkc1R2JDQ4RHUJYef8i7VX6pgZZbkO6JDhQNhko/viewshed3d.jpg?width=750\" width=\"621\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Uf5Jdma8M30SapC2U-ZrdnzV0tupo6ylAmQYwTqH-Smu0nvv0-r1pPmw0xkc1R2JDQ4RHUJYef8i7VX6pgZZbkO6JDhQNhko/viewshed3d.jpg)\n\nThis works technically, but if I am testing to see if people inside the building can see the feature, it breaks down. This is because the test point on the surface of the building does not care if the angle between the test vector and the vector to the feature is too great to actually be visible from inside. I drew a diagram to demonstrate what I mean:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Uf5Jdma8M33c6IvRcOKzC5eFt-zrgQg27nXz4lpU-1rEMHiyRiuSA35SF7f1oYCVgwAXAr4C5jv7Heb9ORkAx9AKRfWqwgo9/4143_001.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Uf5Jdma8M33c6IvRcOKzC5eFt-zrgQg27nXz4lpU-1rEMHiyRiuSA35SF7f1oYCVgwAXAr4C5jv7Heb9ORkAx9AKRfWqwgo9/4143_001.jpg)In theory,I would like to test to see if the angle between vectors is above a certain degree (likely just a \"good enough\" average based on window width and wall depth), and to register any test vector above that angle as obstructed.\n\nI feel like, with enough kludging in python, this would be achievable, but the scripting for Ladybug is daunting to an amateur like me. Does anyone have any ideas how to get this to work either within the python code or by manipulating the results?\n\nThanks,<br/>Shane\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Shane Simon", "created_at": "September 14, 2015 at 05:40PM", "created_by": "ShaneSimon", "topic": "View Angle within View Analysis component?", "id": "topic_1361876"}
