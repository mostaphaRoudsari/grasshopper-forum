{"body": "\nHallo, I have found a possible error for this component. I wanted to create an occupancy schedule from 9 to 18, so it should be 9 hours for each working day. But in the csv file, it is 10 hours and begins from 8 o\u2019 clock. Is this an error? Or I made some mistake?\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 <img alt=\"\" height=\"260\" width=\"631\"/>\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1774974", "name": "gh definition.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1774975", "name": "csv.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "AufAlpen", "created_at": "June 27, 2017 at 4:50am", "created_by": "AufAlpen", "topic": "Question about occupancyGenerator component", "id": "topic_1774976"}
