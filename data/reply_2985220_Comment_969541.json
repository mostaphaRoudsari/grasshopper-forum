{"body": "\nAbraham,\u00a0\n\nThanks for your response and your right that the equinox is not the \"best\" or warmest day of the month. It just struck me that the value on September 22th was more than double the value on June 21th. But then taking a closer look, June has their warmer days in the beginning of the month and September in the end. So comparing just one day is gives a warped image.\u00a0\n\nTake a look a the image below\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/HfUvPSttO0I4A*uad2LT9jZ2Kf1MtfwupWjODcX39Fj5uaHSWPCzZmzLlGDA*2iurEgf3WWN0eYWjiGlR9atE8Pv310f9exl/rslts.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/HfUvPSttO0I4A*uad2LT9jZ2Kf1MtfwupWjODcX39Fj5uaHSWPCzZmzLlGDA*2iurEgf3WWN0eYWjiGlR9atE8Pv310f9exl/rslts.jpg)Taking the average radiation value of the whole month is more or less the same for both months like you said.\n\nThanks for clearing this up and thanks for your help!\n\nCheers!\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Arie-Willem de Jongh", "created_at": "December 6, 2013 at 11:25am", "created_by": "aw", "parent_id": "topic_968797", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_969541"}
