{"body": "\nHi\u00a0\n\n\n\nI added the HB_setEPZone Thresholds component into the canvas. But I am still confused about the same result I got regarding using different cooling set points. See as below:\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0k1PGPsOMFKwJxVJaVdBuxJ1jZoJKtL0E52SA9TrZvVNTzMnu19l2jPDVi5MEDG-ba5ddlaLIJcepHtBrgK8u-hEDYcR*C8K/Results.jpg?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0k1PGPsOMFKwJxVJaVdBuxJ1jZoJKtL0E52SA9TrZvVNTzMnu19l2jPDVi5MEDG-ba5ddlaLIJcepHtBrgK8u-hEDYcR*C8K/Results.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\nI have also attached the modified example file which I add 'HB_setEPZoneThresholds' component into 'Apply Properties for an Energy Simulation' part. Can anyone kindly give me a brief explain?\n\n\n\nVery appreciate in advance!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1437496", "name": "Indoor_Microclimate_Map_Maria.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Maria X", "created_at": "January 12, 2016 at 07:17PM", "created_by": "MariaX", "topic": "Abnormal result for indoor micro-climate map result2", "id": "topic_1437497"}
