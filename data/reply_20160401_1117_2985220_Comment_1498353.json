I downloaded a script that is posted on the ladybug examples on this link :\n\n\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;amp...;](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Radiation_Analysis&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\nI replaced the Breps with the surfaces I needed to test and uploaded the epw file I needed using the open weather file.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI wanted to understand how the software/technology works to run my analysis for my thesis.
