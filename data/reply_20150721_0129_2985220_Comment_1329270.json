{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nThank you for a very interesting discussion!\n\n\n\nI have a question to ask about how to display results in lines on countour planes. What I am asking is a bit different than what is achieved in this example I believe. Instead of visualizing the results from one plane (e.g. ground) to a 3D style I want to visualize the countour lines of different lux/DF values on the same plane that they were calculated.\n\n\n\nWhat I want to achieve is a kind of volumetric daylighting analysis. I have a series of parallel contour planes, vertical to the ground surface, and I want to loft the countour lines of different levels between them in order to create volumetric boundaries of specific DF/Lux levels.\n\n\n\nI am trying for a bit with\u00a0 definition close to this one, but I don't think I am getting it right. Is this possible with this file? Or anyone has an example with any file for this?\n\n\n\nThanks so much in advance!\n\nKind regards,\n\ntheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "July 21, 2015 at 01:29AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1045033", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1329270"}
