{"body": "\nHi Mustafa, There are two parts to the calculation.\n\nThe first step is generating the sky. Ladybug is using [Radiance's gendaymtx](http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/gendaymtx.pdf)\u00a0to generate the sky. If you set sky density to 0, which is the default value, it will generate a Tregenza sky, and density 1 will generate a Reinhart sky.\n\nThe second step is ray-tracing which Ladybug does it in a simplified fashion. It does shoot a ray from every test point to center of every sky patch, and if the point can see the sky patch it calculates the value based on the angle of incident. The simplification is that the calculation doesn't consider reflections between the surfaces and material surfaces. If you need them to be calculated then you need to use Honeybee.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 24, 2015 at 8:00pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1381958", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1385179"}
