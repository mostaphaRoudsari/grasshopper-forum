{"body": "\nHi Olivier,\n\n\n\nHow close to equator is your project? You are unlikely to get a lot of direct glare from the sun (due to low profile angles in the winter, as is the case for higher latitudes). Assuming your structure is open from all sides, you might have to treat your east and west facades differently from the north and south.\n\nA slightly unconventional way to discern the amount of direct glare would be to just look at the direct solar radiation incident on your facade. A few months ago, Chris Mackey and I had discussed a couple of hacks/solutions to do this [here](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/list-of-hoy-for-solar-analysis?xg_source=activity). Assuming your structure is close to the equator, you are only likely to run into direct glare in the mornings and evenings (edit: and also right next to the windows facing south/north if you have furniture there!). So, the idea is to do a radiation study for those hours alone. You could use the radiation study to identify the aspect of the facade most susceptible to solar insolation and then run daylighting simulations to optimize the structure from thereon.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "September 02, 2016 at 09:29AM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1592714", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1592453"}
