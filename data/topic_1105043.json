{"body": "\nHello,\u00a0\n\nFirst of all: Great Work! I can't even imagine how much you have put into this wonderful project. Thank you!\u00a0\n\nI am running solar radiation simulation using ladybug and ecotect and I am getting slightly different results. I am calculating average daily solar radiation for entire year for a massing. The ecotect shows flat roofs to be exposed to over 2200 Wh/m2 while ladybug max daily average is about 1700Wh/m2\u00a0\n\nIn ladybug, i just divide the total by 365 days and since output is in kWh/m2, I multiply by 1000 to get Wh/m2 (using the Re-Color mesh to display final results and the new legend)\n\n\n\nIf anyone knows why, could you please point me in the right direction? My model is in meters.\u00a0\n\nThanks!\u00a0\n\nIlya Bourim\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ilya Bourim", "created_at": "July 22, 2014 at 6:50am", "created_by": "IlyaBourim", "topic": "Ecotect vs Ladybug", "id": "topic_1105043"}
