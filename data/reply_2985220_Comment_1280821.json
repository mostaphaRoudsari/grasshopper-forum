{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThank you for the link. Actually I had already been aware of it. This is why I am trying to run daylight simulation first then pass the generated schedule to the E+ simulation for obtaining energy use of\u00a0electric lighting dimming system.\n\nBut I found a major mistake in my previous test file, that is, **the \"lighting Power\" used in the daylight simulation and the E+ simulation are NOT equal by my carelessness.** The former was 250w (default value in \"Honeybee_Lighting control Recipe\") while the later was\u00a011.8403571*50=592.018w (lightingDensityPerArea*Areaoffloor=lightingpower).\u00a0\n\nHaving corrected this mistake (by using 592.018w for both of them), the results of electric lighting energy obtained from daylight and E+ simulations\u00a0are much closer with each other and more reasonable. In order to see how close they are, I made 3 tests using 3 different weather files (New York, Amsterdam, Guangzhou). The results are listed as follows respectively:\n\nNew York (3.4% difference)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7Nd4ZS9QSR-8kdFVHmkOaExOgWWaAm4EzBF5xbywHMy-6QapqchoM3qVrI2T9djAGRkJUiZfRewhBqOUt5fBVmu/QQ20150505114949.png\" width=\"630\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7Nd4ZS9QSR-8kdFVHmkOaExOgWWaAm4EzBF5xbywHMy-6QapqchoM3qVrI2T9djAGRkJUiZfRewhBqOUt5fBVmu/QQ20150505114949.png)\n\n\n\nAmsterdam (2.7%\u00a0difference)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7OeFj56J435gQ0zGGUpjEuqQ9JeHISAOoe78wGzCBXrPg6E4NH6sG1cgnRvbRP0b9iQse0qNvUyBRswqnqqBpFv/QQ20150505115205.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7OeFj56J435gQ0zGGUpjEuqQ9JeHISAOoe78wGzCBXrPg6E4NH6sG1cgnRvbRP0b9iQse0qNvUyBRswqnqqBpFv/QQ20150505115205.png)\n\n\n\nGuangzhou (3% difference)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7N*t3my4e0hQZyrc0CfyG7Fup-9MuaWzbSyBpx0oCKI6QqCfjBc7vDF3K8AOestIYQZ9iFvn6yYPujPPcaxPuMf/QQ20150505115350.png\" width=\"618\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7N*t3my4e0hQZyrc0CfyG7Fup-9MuaWzbSyBpx0oCKI6QqCfjBc7vDF3K8AOestIYQZ9iFvn6yYPujPPcaxPuMf/QQ20150505115350.png)\n\n**It seems that the difference (around 3%) is acceptable?**\n\n\n\nYou are right. Having checked the IDF file created, as you mentioned above,\u00a0there is no data in the Daylighting class (since the daylight control are not implemented in the E+ simulation). But, the light is **\"fully/partially\"** on according to the **\"fractions\"**\u00a0in the generated\u00a0lighting schedule list, **which already takes in account the dimming system by the setting in\u00a0\"Honeybee_Lighting control Recipe\" in daylight simulation.**\n\nThen, what\u00a0the E+ simulation did in terms of calculating\u00a0electric lighting energy use\u00a0is just as the following formulation: **lightingDensityPerArea * Areaoffloor * sum of lighting schedule list (generated by daylight simulation in this case) =\u00a0electric lighting energy use, which has been verified by the comparison of results obtained from E+ simulation and calculated by the above formulation. (The results are exactly the same.)\u00a0**Please see the updated gh file attached.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7MvbI5LgFr34fhyMg1WceXSjes-vgUyi1rA9wWpIrIZMZn6Z-vIZ0H0Q*iMxrBWQ0sAvPKjLRiLPoCFWHmDL-ua/QQ20150505122633.png\" width=\"463\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7MvbI5LgFr34fhyMg1WceXSjes-vgUyi1rA9wWpIrIZMZn6Z-vIZ0H0Q*iMxrBWQ0sAvPKjLRiLPoCFWHmDL-ua/QQ20150505122633.png)\n\nTherefore, I assume that the E+ results\u00a0generated\u00a0in this way (using the lighting schedule\u00a0generated\u00a0by the daylight simulation) are still reliable,\u00a0although there exist some tiny difference (around 3%) for some unknown reason (**Maybe Daysim does not follow the same formulation mentioned above? Can you imagine the possible reason?**).\n\n\n\nIn addition,\u00a0\n\n- I am not clear with what you mentioned as \"they definitely don't share daylight considerations\". What \"daylight considerations\" here refer to? (sky condition / sky file? but in the annual Daylight Simulation, only weather file is required instead of\u00a0sky file)\n\n- A basic question: In E+ simulation, has the waste heat generated by the electric lighting been considered as \"internal heat gain\" (showed in the above image)? If so, can I say that \"energy use for electrical light\" is fully converted to \"the waste heat\" + \"Illuminance in\u00a0lux\".\n\nNamely, **energy use for electrical light =\u00a0the waste heat +\u00a0Illuminance in\u00a0lux (lux can be converted to electric power in watts)?**\n\n\n\nMany thanks!\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1280822", "name": "text8.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "May 5, 2015 at 5:32am", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280522", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280821"}
