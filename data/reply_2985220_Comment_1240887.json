{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI agree that there is some confussion with this definition and how E+ allows light load definitions. In the Light section there is an option Design Level Calculation Method where you can define loads per area, Light level and more. The Light level is the sum of Watts of the lights in the zone (crazy way of defining things, but possible). So Mostapha's interpretation of the component input is to define the lights with this \"crazy\" way, instead of using it as a light desired level.\n\nBurin is right in showing the Object Class needed, but i'm afraid it overlaps in some amount with this [discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/error-message-when-i-use-the-indoor-view-factor-calculator?page=2&amp;commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1240705&amp;x=1#2985220Comment1240705) (shading controls)... which seems difficult to implement right now. I'm willing to work with you Chris on the workflow and maybe even more.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 12, 2015 at 12:40am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240809", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240887"}
