{"body": "\nMona,\n\nOk. \u00a0I have fixed the issue. \u00a0I wish there was a better way to deal with this but I had to address the issue by parsing the input EPW file, which adds an extra second or two to the Run Simulation component but there is really no way to address this issue without it.\n\nThen, based on whether there is a sizing period in the weather file or not, I either take the weather file sizing periods (if they are there) or I take the entire months of the period with the coldest and warmest temperature to size the system. \u00a0The latter happens in your case.\n\nPlease find the attached working file.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1231095", "name": "_building4energysimulationCWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 24, 2015 at 5:03pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1231244", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1231094"}
