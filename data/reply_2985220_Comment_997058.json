{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nThanks for letting me know about this. \u00a0It turns out that what you were experiencing was not specifically related to concave or convex shapes but was a result of a bug in the BooleanIntersect operation of RhinoCommon. \u00a0Essentially, some solar vectors were being discounted from the generation of the solar envelope because the BooleanIntersect operation was failing. \u00a0The shape you found that broke the component just happen to have the last booleanIntersect fail and so it output no results. \u00a0\n\n\n\nI have put up the issue I was experiencing in a discussion and we will hopefully get it resolved soon ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/differening-results-with-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/differening-results-with-ghpython-booleanintersect)).\u00a0For the time being, you can definitely trust the results of the solar fan but hold off on using the solar envelope until we get this bug in BooleanIntersect addressed.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 26, 2014 at 8:12pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_996727", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_997058"}
