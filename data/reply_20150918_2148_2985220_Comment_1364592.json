{"body": "Hi So,\n\nI would imagine that HB can handle any geometry Rhino feeds to it. It would only depends on the file tolerance which in this case I would suggest is quite low.\n\nThe best way to do this would be to model very accurately the sheet and then run a very simple simulation of one room geometry.\n\nIn this case I would suggest the smallest possible grid and the highest possible quality settings (both in the sky resolution and radiance options, especially bounces).\n\nYou can find daylight examples on this blog simply follow their logic (after you make sure to update the components in their new version).\n\nAnother option would be to use window 7.3 to model the sheet (looks a bit like perforated). I don't think it has it in its templates but it could worth a try looking in it. Maybe in the least you have a benchmark to compare. Window can give you an X ml bdsf file which you can input in HB.\n\nRegards,\nTheodore", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "September 18, 2015 at 09:48PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1364623", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1364592"}
