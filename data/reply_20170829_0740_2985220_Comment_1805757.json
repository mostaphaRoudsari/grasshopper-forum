{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nYes. I know the limitations of the E+ daylight models and i know coupling Radiance and E+ is the way to go. I'm just now in a case that i \"have\" to deal only with E+.\n\nFrom\u00a0[this reference](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-0/input-output-reference/page-016.html#daylightingdeviceshelf) i see that in effect E+ accounts only for the ceiling reflection (but no mutual surface reflections).\n\nMy question was more related to the technical procedure to be done in HB to include the lightshelf in the calculation.\n\nWhile i'm writing this i see that it will be pretty much complicated. For the LS to be defined i need to divide the window in two parts (upper and lower) in addition to all other definitions\n\nWell. I'll drop this for now.\n\nThanks for the help.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 29, 2017 at 07:40AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1805748", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1805757"}
