For example if you have a facade 20x20 meters and you choose 1 as gridSize, you will have 20x20 analysis cells for that facade.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime,\u00a0you can take a look at this example file.\n\n\n\nAntonello\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1645150", "name": "privacyanalysis_example.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "November 23, 2016 at 04:07PM", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "topic_1645141", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1645148"}
