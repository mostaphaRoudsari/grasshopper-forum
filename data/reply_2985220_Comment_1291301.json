{"body": "\nThanks Theodoros.\n\nYesterday i tried the dupborder option with no success. But the weird thing happended after your reply.\n\nI baked again and did the dupborder and it showed a very tiny difference between one window and the parent wall (east facade). But, the way i'm creating the windows is this case is that i'm having the whole surface of the wall (no trimmed window) then i add the window surfaces with the HB_addHBGlz. It is supposed to work \"clean\" since it is geometry independent on my side. But it is the HB_addHBGlz the one that is creating the small hole.\n\nThen i tried to change the model Tolerance to 0.001 (instead the default 0.01). It didn't solve the issue but instead it created a new one on the Southern facade, where the windows were a (really) bit apart from the parent surface. To make it short, i aligned the southern windows, the east facade still have the small gap, but now i get the ClosedBrep zone and the IndoorViewFactor component is now working ... weird (but good).\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 21, 2015 at 6:15am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1291272", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1291301"}
