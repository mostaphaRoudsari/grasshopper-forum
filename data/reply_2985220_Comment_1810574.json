{"body": "\nFirst up, simulating BSDF-based light shelves **properly** using Radiance, which is what HB[+] uses, is a fairly non-trivial task. So, I hope you have some experience with using Radiance.\n\nYou need to assign the BSDF file to a Honeybee surface. If this is just a single simulation, and not a parametric run of multiple lightshelf types, it is better to stick to Daylight Coefficients instead of going the Five Phase route. If you do use the Three/Five Phase method, and the light shelf stretches across the window (eg from exterior to interior), split them into separate internal and external surfaces. Within Radiance parlance, such shading systems can be categorized as [out-of-plane shading devices](https://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2015-philadelphia/presentations/day1/OutOfPlaneShading.pdf).\n\nFinally, it would be advisable to do a before and after check of illuminance/imaging values, without and with the lightshelf respectively, to ensure that the results make sense. It might be a good idea to place a grid of downward-pointing illuminance sensors on the ceiling to ensure that the light redirection is indeed taking place.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "on Friday", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810445", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810574"}
