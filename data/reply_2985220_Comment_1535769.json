{"body": "\nHi Duncan thanks for the help it's running the simulation.\n\nI basically did again the solve adjacencies after the glazing surface process, and now it seems okay I think.\n\n\n\nHowever, after running the simulation and trying out the 'ColorZones' component, it colors only the floor of each zone and not the entire zone itself.\n\nI checked the zone list and there are 6 items each a zone, not surfaces, so this is strange that it would color only one surface in each zone....\n\n\n\n[http://dropcanvas.com/#2o15aN91iQH9fL](http://dropcanvas.com/#2o15aN91iQH9fL)\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks again.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yafim Simanovsky", "created_at": "May 24, 2016 at 8:41am", "created_by": "YafimSimanovsky", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535762", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535769"}
