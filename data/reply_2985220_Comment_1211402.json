That's why i'll be glad if you, whenever you have the time, check the file.\n\nIn the meantime i changed some definitions and the temperatures are \"right\" but it still bothers me that the heating in winter time is almost none and, beyond that, the cooling is much higher than the heating.\n\nThe OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf in my system is dated 19.7.2014 and the OpenStudioMasterTemplate_1412836435.idf from 9.10.2014.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 25, 2015 at 10:01pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1211199", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1211402"}
