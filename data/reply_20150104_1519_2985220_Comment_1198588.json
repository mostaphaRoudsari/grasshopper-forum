{"body": "\nHi Youngjae,\n\nI saw this post a while ago and I am sorry for responding so late. \u00a0Natural ventilation is definitely something that I am going to need for my thesis work and my part time job so I have begun implementing some basic natural ventilation stuff over the last couple of weeks. \u00a0Coincidentally, right as you made this post that included the orifice equation with Qstack, I was implementing a component that allows you to use this equation in E+. \u00a0The component (and the corresponding equation) is mostly meant for cases where you have \u00a0zones with windows that are NOT connected by an air wall (or a larger airflow network).\n\nTo use the more general natural ventilation lingo, this is for cases where you want to look at single-sided or cross ventilation within individual zones.\n\nOver the next week, I will be implementing a component to add a chimney to a zone, which I think will serve many of your purposes that you seem to be suggesting in this post.\n\nEventually, we will try to implement the complete Airflow Network (AFN), which will allow you to model multi-zone airflow but this is really a huge task and is likely months away.\n\nLet me know if you get the chance to try the new Nat Vent component on the github and I will let you know once I implement the chimney.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 04, 2015 at 03:19PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1188113", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1198588"}
