{"body": "\nHassan,\n\nYour Grasshopper file is not run-able as you have not internalized the geometry in the file. \u00a0Also, the script has way too many components for us to easily understand what you want us to look at.\n\nFinally, you don't seem to be looking at the \"totalSolarGain\" output but are instead just looking at cooling load. \u00a0Remember that solar is just one part of the equation that drives cooling and, a lot of the time, the heat from other sources will drive the majority of the cooling load (including infiltration/ventilation of hot outdoor air, conduction through the envelope, people gains, equipment gains, lighting gains).\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 28, 2017 at 09:50AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1774849", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1775595"}
