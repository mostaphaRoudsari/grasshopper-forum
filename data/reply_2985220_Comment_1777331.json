{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI think that I understood your definition , In retrospect I see that my previous questions wasn't too smart. I wanted to replace your geometry and test surface on mine, I added \"Bounding Box\", and now\u00a0I am trying to figure out how to\u00a0make\u00a0\"Inclusion test\". \u00a0But I don't understand why, when\u00a0I add a new \"test surface\" my file is crashing or the surface is totally yellow, and even I canoot see \"MeshRay\". I mean it looks like there is no problematic points. If you could check\u00a0my files\u00a0out and explain me how could I fix it I would be very grateful.<br/>I came to conclusion that maybe the problem is about the scale of my geometry, but I don't know.\n\n\n\nAlso I checked your orginal gh. file, I modyfied your surface and it's done\u00a0yellow too.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1777332", "name": "findmaximumgeometry_myTest.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1777333", "name": "test2.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1777334", "name": "POL_Gdansk.Port.Polnocny.121400_IMGW.epw"}], "created_by_name": "\u0141ukasz Dwulit", "created_at": "July 2, 2017 at 1:24pm", "created_by": "LukaszDwulit", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1772257", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1777331"}
