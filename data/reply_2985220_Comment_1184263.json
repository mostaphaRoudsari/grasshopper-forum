{"body": "\nMasoome,\n\nYou can see in the definition of the blind a row 45; Slat angle.\n\nThis is where you can change the angle of your blind.\n\nSee attached file. There you need to change just the slider with the angle, update some of the components definitions (see attched: ctrl+E 1, 2 and 3. Not sure how it can be done automatically ... or more efficiently) and it will run it for you.\n\nThose are the good news. But unfortunately i have also bad news:\n\nEven though the WindowMaterial:Blind:EquivalentLayer is defined well, EnergyPlus is not taking it into account. This is a bug in E+ i think. In the Construction object the name of the Blind is highlighted, like it is missing. When you see what you can peek from the list you don't see the Blind name.\n\nMoreover, i see that there is also another Object (Construction:WindowEquivalentLayer) that is supposed to be the one that \"can model various mix of glazing and shading layers combination\". But still when you define an object under this type you don't get the EquivalentLayerBlind either.\n\nI'll try to report this on the helpdesk of E+.\n\nChris or Mostapha, are you aware of this issue with E+?\n\n-A.\n\nHope it helps a bit.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1184264", "name": "SimpleEnergySimulationBase_Blinds_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 9, 2014 at 7:11am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184854", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184263"}
