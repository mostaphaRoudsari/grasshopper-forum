{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nGlad to hear that you are making the full jump to Ladybug and I hope that I can help in the process!\n\nI probably could have been clearer in that previous discussion that the climate consultant strategies that I did not implement on the psych chart were because I thought that the Climate Consultant methods really mis-represented them. \u00a0This was definitely the case for the \"shading\" polygon, which never really made sense to me and, in the case of building shading, it is really too orientation-specific to be represented on the chart. \u00a0I could imagine psych chart polygons describing the MRT delta of someone sitting in the sun vs shade \u00a0but this is probably better represented using two comfort polygons with high/low MRTs (derived from the solar adjusted temperature component) rather than a specific strategy polygon. \u00a0Also the natural ventilation polygon in climate consultant seemed to do more damage than it helped. \u00a0I always thought the actual \"comfort\" polygon was a better representation of natural ventilation's potential than any other possible strategy polygon.\n\nFor the three strategies that you cite there, we have a \"Thermal Mass + Night Vent\" polygon in the current psych chart (let me know if I'm mis-understanding your \"thermal mass\" reference). I felt that the climate consultant method was a fair here, although it had some important limitations that are built into the psych chart methods.\n\nAs for the last one (passive solar heating), I agree that this should have a spot on the chart. \u00a0Now that I've had time to think about it, I can see a good representation of this as long as the user connects up the \"globalHorizontalRadiation\" to the annualHourlyData. \u00a0I'll try to implement this as soon as I get the chance (hopefully before the semester starts):\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/412](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/412)\n\nAre there any other important polygons that I am missing? \u00a0Also, remember that I added some polygons that climate consultant did not have (like desiccant dehumidification and occupant use of fans). Any new ideas for polygons are always welcome.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 21, 2017 at 09:23PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1801571", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1801648"}
