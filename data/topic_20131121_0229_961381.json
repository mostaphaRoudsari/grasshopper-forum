{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nSee attached. Trying, after the thread in the Comment section, to build a simple example for view analysis.\n\nI get this error:\n\n1. Solution exception:global name 'viewPoints' is not defined\n\nAnd don't know how to move forward. It is strange. Before this error i get another one related to (unfortunately didn't copied the error and now can't reproduce) \"JoinMesh\". After this one i input a new ViewAnalysis component and then the error shifted to ViewPoints.\n\nThe Ladybug is flying free :-)\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A961380", "name": "ViewAnalysis_01.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 21, 2013 at 02:29AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "View Analysis", "id": "topic_961381"}
