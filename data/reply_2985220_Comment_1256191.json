{"body": "\nHi Daniel,\n\nI have experienced similar situations where I eat up all 16 GB of my RAM on my machine. \u00a0I think that the unfortunate reality is that, compared to other non-visual means of scripting, Grasshopper is not necessarily the best at dealing with huge amounts of data in relation to the memory of the machine.\n\nUsually my way around the problem is to alter something to the specific simulation that I am trying to run (either decreasing gridsize or something of that nature). \u00a0What simulations are giving you the most problems with the memory? \u00a0Also, what is the memory of your machine? \u00a0You really need to have at least 4 GB to use Ladybug + Honeybee well (I think that this isn't too far from the system requirements of Rhino).\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 4, 2015 at 11:29am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1253949", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256191"}
