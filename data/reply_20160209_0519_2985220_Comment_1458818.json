{"body": "\nWell ... well ... well ...\n\nFirst of all, i can't recreate your error. At first i thought that maybe it is related to RHino tolerance. Changed mine to different options but nothing. Try also changing it at your end and recalculating the GH.\n\nSaying that, then i started to test the HB_ViewAnalysis and found some bugs that i will report on the github. Increasing the resolution gives weird/crazy results (for instance, 100 on vertical surfaces). Something is going on there that i can't catch fully.\n\nPlease look at\u00a0[this issue](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/229) in github.\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 09, 2016 at 05:19AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1458580", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1458818"}
