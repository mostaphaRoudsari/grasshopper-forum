{"body": "\nHi Saeran,\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply. I was also thinking that a dense grid would take immense calculation times.\n\n\n\nI'm also leaning towards the planar surfaces idea. I think drawings isolines of different illuminance values on each plane and then using GH native components to create 3d surfaces from these isolines could do the trick. It would be rough but ideally there could be some automation on increasing accuracy (i.e. number of planes). I wonder if the parametric definition by Mostapha can be adjusted for this.\n\n\n\nAnyways, I'm not as versed in GH scripting but I'll let everyone know if I had some success.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 25, 2015 at 1:20am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1294229", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1294230"}
