{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI generated the shading mask for a very simple model, placing the test point in a window sill. What is bizzare (as you can see in the image) is the fact that this point can see behind the walls!\n\nAlso you have provided ain image with a transparent shading mask, is ti possible to explain me how you did it?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nKostas\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1140730", "name": "image1.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "kostas mourkos", "created_at": "October 01, 2014 at 08:38AM", "created_by": "kostasmourkos", "topic": "inquires regarding the shading mask component", "id": "topic_1140731"}
