{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\n\n\nIt's no problem, haven't done anything yet :)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately I can't be much help with that error. I've never installed in Windows (also not using the docker version of OpenFOAM) and it seems that error is not an OpenFOAM related error but a docker/VM error.\u00a0\n\n<br/>I'm sure something will be found in cfd-online. If not let me know if you have Linux and we can install OpenFOAM with a couple commands :)\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 27, 2016 at 11:01pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537355", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537605"}
