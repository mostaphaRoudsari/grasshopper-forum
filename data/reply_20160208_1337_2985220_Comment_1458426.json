{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\n\n\nWe face similar communication issues. To get past them we have rallied around the idea of promoting an\u00a0informed design process. Data-driven design neuters artistic expression. Data-informed design empowers it. Tools that map the design space, rather than focus towards an \"optimized\" solution, are more useful to designers. Understanding where the current design fits within potential alternates will help convince designers that meaningful improvements can be made. Comparative analysis to nudge the team towards a particular option, or strong data to quantify exactly how much worse one solution is than another, always gives the design team the option of choosing the bad option, but encourages the good option. We recognize that architects have to balance far more than just performance criteria. Client wishes, site constraints, programmatic constraints, all determine the best overall solution. Energy or daylighting analysis is only one part. Due to this reality, it\u00a0is great\u00a0to have data that encourages a compromise.\u00a0If my solution is all or nothing, it will get rejected. If I can present incremental improvement, the team can balance that change against competing criteria. By charting the range of possible solutions, Pollination and Design Explorer don't force a design decision. They merely inform the process. Using them to empower a conversation about\u00a0the relative performance of design options or identify a variety of improvement options makes\u00a0these new methods\u00a0far more appealing to designers than optimizing scripts or shaming energy metrics.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe think that a posture that respects both\u00a0aesthetic quality\u00a0and\u00a0performance criteria encourages better design. To this end, singular optimization is\u00a0too selfish and\u00a0inflexible to be useful within an integrated\u00a0team. We think that design explorer and similar tools that support conversation and compromise\u00a0are the right way to go.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "February 08, 2016 at 01:37PM", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1456821", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1458426"}
