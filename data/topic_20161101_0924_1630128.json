{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI downloaded the example file for \"integrated day lighting and Energy simulation\" example file, but it does not work unfortunately. The weather file works, the geometry is read (it is the box in the example file) but no annual .ill results are generated from annual daylighting simulation. The error says: \"Can't find the results for the study\". Would you please take a look at my file and tell me what I am doing wrong. I truly appreciate your help.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nLadan\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1630125", "name": "Integrated_DLE.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1630126", "name": "Box2.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1630127", "name": "DaylightAnalysis.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 01, 2016 at 09:24AM", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "Problem with Integrated Daylighting and Energy Simulation Example File", "id": "topic_1630128"}
