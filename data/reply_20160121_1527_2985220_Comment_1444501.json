{"body": "\nHi Leland,\n\n\n\nThank you for the advice, I will endeavour to spend the next week exploring a way to do this. I am disappointed that I never fully learnt coding, otherwise I might have been able to do this process quicker by making my own script to analyse the results... perhaps a spagehti mess of native components and external cloud-based programs could help fill the need for sensitivity analysis in the meantime.\n\n\n\nThanks for the chat, and I will definitely be sharing the results of the thesis once it is completed and cleared for publishing in May-June.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nElly\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 21, 2016 at 03:27PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1444639", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1444501"}
