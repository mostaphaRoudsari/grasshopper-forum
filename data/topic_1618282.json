{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nSomething strange is happening when I try to export gbXML with GrizzlyBear. With the previous versions of HB+LB this was not happening. I wonder if it's something I am the only one experiencing.\n\nThe GB component gives a waning and an error:\n\nWarning: 1. Failed to find \u00a0in the Honeybee schedule library.\n\nError:\u00a01. Solution exception:'NoneType' object is unsubscriptable\n\n\n\nAnyone has an idea about these? I attach a test file on a very simple geometry.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nAntonio\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1618281", "name": "test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antonio D'Aquilio", "created_at": "October 14, 2016 at 3:12am", "created_by": "AntonioDAquilio", "topic": "GrizzlyBear error", "id": "topic_1618282"}
