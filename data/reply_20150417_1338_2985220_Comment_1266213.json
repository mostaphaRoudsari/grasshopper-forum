{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nThank you for you message.Sorry for the late reply, I am still struggling with octopus.\n\nYes you are completely right that the cleanest way would be it to work with HB directly.It is a group assignment and my friend works only in EP.\n\n\n\nThe input data has already been added and the idea is to do some other simulations in GH while keeping the geometry.So we don't go over the input data again.\n\nAnd also learn the process for future projects.\n\nIs there a site or pdf where it shows what imported and whats not?\n\nNow after importing and flattening the geometry do I rely on the results?Will the angle extruded shape make difference in results?\n\nThanks again,\n\n\n\nNita\n\n\n\n**p.s.**If you have any ideas about the wwr optimization \u00a0with octopus i would love to hear them.(I also still haven't figured out what the problem with my model for energy simulations...I constantly get errors)\n\n\n\nNow im 'studying' this discussion and definition( [http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/parametric-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/parametric-energi-simulation-with-e?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1220805&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987))it loooks far more complex than I though..and its taking ages..any input would be a great help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nit\u00eb", "created_at": "April 17, 2015 at 01:38PM", "created_by": "Nita", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262867", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1266213"}
