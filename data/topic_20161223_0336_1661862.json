{"body": "\nHi Everybody.\n\n\n\nI'm having some problems trying to connect my HBzone to the OpenStudio component, since, from what I understood, the schedules that I used are not recognized by it.\n\nDespite I followed all the steps that Chris has suggested (I replaced the 'OpenStudioMasterTemplate.idf' in my ladybug default folder)\u00a0I still can't run the simulation.\n\n\n\nThese are the errors that occur:\n\n- \"1. Failed to find DEFAULTCSVPLACEHOLDER in the Honeybee schedule library.\"\n\n- \"1. Solution exception:'NoneType' object is unsubscriptable\"\n\n\n\nHow would you think I could manage the problem in my file?\n\nI'm sorry if my question might be trivial for you but I'm still a beginner in the use of the software.\n\nI attached the gh file below.\n\nThank you very much for your help and your work.\n\nCarlie\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1661861", "name": "EnergyModeling_CS.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Carlie_3", "created_at": "December 23, 2016 at 03:36AM", "created_by": "Carlie_3", "topic": "Problems between OpenStudio component and schedules", "id": "topic_1661862"}
