{"body": "\nSomeone needs to have a closer look to this but just a quick check shows there is a difference between the mesh face area if I use the Area component or calculate it for each face and add them up together. Since your geometry doesn't have non-planar faces, or that's what I assumed, we shouldn't have this difference. This can by itself be the source of the error.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/z6oYvgD0qBGfMohAFG9ZZbPdUa8UnD2fxLYeWU87QTzcf0BVr1oaq3C99JtxYtdru7sWQzShCioMM5mw2D7eIlcp*l0uXXWe/area_difference.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/z6oYvgD0qBGfMohAFG9ZZbPdUa8UnD2fxLYeWU87QTzcf0BVr1oaq3C99JtxYtdru7sWQzShCioMM5mw2D7eIlcp*l0uXXWe/area_difference.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 22, 2017 at 05:19PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1676270", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1676531"}
