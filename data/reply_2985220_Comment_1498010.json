{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThank you for replying. I feel a bit like royalty has replied as I've watched everyone of your youtube videos. Many more than once :)\n\n\n\nI've tried to replicate part 3 of the example file but when I select 3 for fan driven ventilation my component doesn't change to give me fan options (like I believe it should). Am I missing a key step somewhere?\u00a0\n\nAlso whenever I close and reopen my gh file the EPsetzoneschedule component goes red and comes up with an error about ventilation schedules which I am a bit baffled about as nothing has changed in the interim.\u00a0\n\nDo you if anyone has posted any examples on how to set up an apartment building multizone Honeybee model? I've been trying to put this together from scratch (I'm very new to Honeybee) and it would be much easier to follow someone else's example. I feel like I am making a lot of rookie errors everywhere.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to reply.\n\nChelle\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1498011", "name": "Great North Rd Energy Model-30 Mar.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chelle Payne", "created_at": "March 31, 2016 at 7:54pm", "created_by": "ChellePayne", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1497076", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1498010"}
