{"body": "\nHi Mikael,\n\n\n\nI am not sure how clear this will be, but consider this example:\n\nLet's say you have fixed geometry 'A' in the scene consisting of everything else except the blinds. Let the geometry of the blinds be (B1,B2..B5). Then the geometry for the five iterations will be ((A+B1), (A+B2)...(A+B5)).\n\nAnd assume that you are measuring illuminance at four points inside the room (x1,x2,x3,x4) and one point outside the room(y1).\n\nThe way Daysim works ( and should work as per the best of my understanding) is that for each setting of the blind (ie. B1,B2,..B5), a separate value of (x1,x2,x3,x4) gets calculated through the Daylight Coefficient Method. So let's say you have illuminance thresholds of (p,q,r,s,t) corresponding to (B1,B2,..B5). What the shade-control algorithm does is that it compares the illuminance at y1 with your threshold of (p,q,..t) and then chooses a value of (x1,x,2,x3,x4) on basis of that. So, when we repeat this process for (365x24=)8760 hours , we end up with a value of a shade setting for each hour which was set on basis of your threshold illuminance values.\n\n\n\nI would have gladly answered your question on HB itself, however, I usually work with Daysim directly through commandline.\n\n\n\n(BTW, if you are interested in reading more about Daysim google Christoph Reinhart's dissertation on the subject, along with some papers by Zack Rogers).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "October 6, 2016 at 3:22pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1611850", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1612546"}
