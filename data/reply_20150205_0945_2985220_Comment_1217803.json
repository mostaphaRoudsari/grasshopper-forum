{"body": "\nTheodore, Abraham, thank you for your responses. I still can't get it to work.\n\nFor point 1, you were right Theodore, it was the type of surface, the shade component doesn't give me an error anymore, but it doesn't give me a result either. I'm also a little confused because in the file you attached to your response the brep geometry that is working is seems to be a curve, not a surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor point 2, I checked the surface normals and the surface is pointing upwards. I also try flipping the surface, and the result was no sun hours at all, so I deleted it, made a new surface, check the normals, and I still only get 1 hour of sun on a horizontal surface during the summer in Texas.\u00a0\n\n[\u00a0](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nNOqzuU--h9XlOfMyAuIGpM59ujrWht6EN8SaswhTwcCSEsLKKy813j5wIfCwPSXnkqaCU7VOGEIaw26P7mrLN0N8bO9KKET/surfacenormals.JPG)\n\nPlease see attached images.
