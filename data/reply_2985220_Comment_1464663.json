{"body": "\nHi Tim,\n\n\n\nThanks for posting this comment. Comments like this are much needed. I agree with your point about the extensive number of components in Honeybee and understand how frustrating it can be when you get started with them but at the same time that's exactly what makes Honeybee as flexible as it is right now.\n\n\n\nI'm borrowing a number of slides from Chris's presentation where he uses the analogy of tool vs toolkit to describe how the vision behind Ladybug + Honeybee is different from other available tools. It's the nature of the toolkit to have several options for the same problem:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/g4l9B0NZP47K7aFILeMJ2lmohAtVxXIIb4VmRqNGCvblbgdAlMPtfOqSZjmzDA9JFEkkVD77uf6MvE85iAqO--3a4A-PJi1G/IntrotoLadybugPresentation3.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/g4l9B0NZP47K7aFILeMJ2lmohAtVxXIIb4VmRqNGCvblbgdAlMPtfOqSZjmzDA9JFEkkVD77uf6MvE85iAqO--3a4A-PJi1G/IntrotoLadybugPresentation3.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/g4l9B0NZP47rcdatM3ZCO9B0oJW1lyNz-q1gTr3PONqlY0E9Qcp85kpsFL7U7dmGgTneBCIBSqWLBMeq6TUOUFkxLz4HDCSn/IntrotoLadybugPresentation2.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/g4l9B0NZP47rcdatM3ZCO9B0oJW1lyNz-q1gTr3PONqlY0E9Qcp85kpsFL7U7dmGgTneBCIBSqWLBMeq6TUOUFkxLz4HDCSn/IntrotoLadybugPresentation2.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/g4l9B0NZP47dJD2a9V9mxshJva10wGoi1CBWttfx6VMehk34W0zoNeJ5nFZre3cXCltgbKkem4gTTHHinOsLHsVf7V313oFe/IntrotoLadybugPresentation1.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/g4l9B0NZP47dJD2a9V9mxshJva10wGoi1CBWttfx6VMehk34W0zoNeJ5nFZre3cXCltgbKkem4gTTHHinOsLHsVf7V313oFe/IntrotoLadybugPresentation1.png)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/g4l9B0NZP44WiTpgpcHqccc*q3te938YGTu1xeIZrqVfRU9fcgb-UivAQ8F9kqi6TKwBAK3d9fWBYARLCHx5oGc8Wyfu9Ay8/IntrotoLadybugPresentation.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/g4l9B0NZP44WiTpgpcHqccc*q3te938YGTu1xeIZrqVfRU9fcgb-UivAQ8F9kqi6TKwBAK3d9fWBYARLCHx5oGc8Wyfu9Ay8/IntrotoLadybugPresentation.png)\n\nAt the same time, I totally agree with your comment that there is a great chance in improving the current \"toolkit\" by re-evaluating the components and re-structure and/or merge them together to make it more user friendly. [We tried once to re-structure the components based on our understan...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/46)\u00a0to address similar issues to what you mentioned but the instant feedback was pretty negative. As a result we reverted back to what we had in place.\n\n\n\nHere is exactly where we need suggestions from you and other users. Please consider submitting issues for all the changes that you think can make Ladybug and Honeybee easier to learn and use. Now is the best time as we're almost re-writing everything.\n\n\n\nThe underscores are there for a reason. They indicate which inputs are required, optional or required with a default value. [Check number 4](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/resources/Ladybug%20Grahpic%20Standards.md#hard-and-fast-rules).\n\n\n\nI'm not sure what do you refer to by blank inputs? Do you mean the separators? If that is the case then yes. That's the limitation that we currently have to group inputs.\n\n\n\nBack to the integration of new codes (such as this one) into older components it's not as easy as it sounds mainly because of the way that the current components are developed. I'm doing my best to get this issue solved for the new development. Also once we have an API users can make their own customized components which will make it easier to keep the official components for Ladybug and Honeybee to essential components.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 16, 2016 at 10:40pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463246", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1464663"}
