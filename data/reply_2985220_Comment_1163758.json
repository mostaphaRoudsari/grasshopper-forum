{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe use a single-ray calc engine to test various orientations and shading devices in real-time. A 145 patch skydome is often too coarse to pick up geometry changes. Of course we would use radiance for final runs, but we need something that gives us instantaneous feedback while we\u00a0explore approaches.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe ability to create custom skies allows us study very particular data sets. We can do this using the method you described and calculate values with our single-ray calc engine, but we can't run a custom sky in radiance. Is there any way to allow an occ-file type input into the Honeybee CM component? The analysis period defined by a start and end hour is limiting. We need hourly pattern inputs. Or, is there a way to combine a series of CB skies into a single file that can then be input into the Honeybee radiance components? I just can't wrap my head around the radiance gensky\u00a0source code to even figure out where to do this.\n\nThe shade optimizer seems to already be using a complex\u00a0custom sky based on\u00a0E-plus heating/cooling values. I assume this is still the single-ray\u00a0method used in the ladybug components. Are you planning to expand those kind of capabilities into\u00a0components that use the radiance engine?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "November 7, 2014 at 7:24am", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163490", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163758"}
