{"body": "\nHi Jonny,\n\nIn order for other people to be able to help you, you need to provide more information about your abilities and interests. Do you want to get involved in the development or do you want to use ladybug and honeybee as part of a workflow. I can also imagine so much that can be done out of Grasshopper environment for data visualization of energy and daylight simulation. What are you interested to work on for your thesis?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 5, 2016 at 5:26pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1523794", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1524010"}
