{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and team.\n\n\n\nI was wondering if it was possible to add a raw UTCI calculator to the toolbox.\n\n\n\nI'd like to input, lets say, 4 equally long lists of dryBulpTemp, MRT, Vwind10 and RelHum.\n\nAnd then I dont want the extra analysisPeriod parts and statistics in it.\n\n\n\nThe reason I'm asking, is because we are currently working on a spatial mapping of these inputs and would like the combined output to be UTCI for urban plans.\n\n\n\nI currently have 9000 values in each list and when I graft all inputs, it seems to work, but it's slow and I'm pretty that this way the script runs everything including all python-headers and so on, 9000 times.\n\n\n\nAnd also, is it possible to do a \"simple\" calculation like this in threaded mode?\n\n\n\nAnyways, thanks as always for a great suite.\n\n\n\nPS Chris: thanks for the tutorials on performance.network, it is really beneficial - but you should wish for a new microphone for christmas! ;-)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1627292", "name": "Capture.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Mathias s n", "created_at": "October 27, 2016 at 8:42am", "created_by": "Mathiassn", "topic": "A raw UTCI calculation in Ladybug", "id": "topic_1627293"}
