{"body": "\nJust wanted to add, I get another small funky warning lately. As I said not in my work pc today so I can't remember it word for word. But it was something to do with Energy Plus version. It said something like it found '8.1.0' instead of \"8.1.0\".\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'll paste the actual error tomorrow, if this didnt help.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 7:33pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279575", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279070"}
