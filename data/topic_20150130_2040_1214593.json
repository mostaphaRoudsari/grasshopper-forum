{"body": "\nHello guys!\n\n\n\nFirst of all I want to express my deepest gratitude for all your work. It is not only that you have created amazing functionalities and tools for our research and work. Mostly it is that you went out of your way to properly display how they work and what they can accomplish.\n\n\n\nOn that note, I have to say that I am a beginner, mostly of Rhino than the ideas discussed in the tools.\n\n\n\nI am currently on the Shade Benefit Evaluation and I am having problems when running the final step. I belive that since I am a complete beginner in Rhino the program stalls because of bad geometry (is it possible that the size of items covering the doll is just too much?). When I run the benefit evaluation Rhino and Grasshoper stop responding until they suck out all computer memory and windows shuts them down.\n\n\n\nI am attaching my rhino file here, maybe someone in the group can help a true beginner. The ladybug file is exactly the same as in the video, as I followed Chris to the dot.\n\n\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1214592", "name": "ShadeBenefitEvaluation.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 30, 2015 at 08:40PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Beginner's problems", "id": "topic_1214593"}
