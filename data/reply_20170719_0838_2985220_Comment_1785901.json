{"body": "\nThis is an interesting case. Before getting to the radiation analysis you should check the results of the energy analysis and see what is the reason for overheat (which is why you need cooling). Is it because of radiation or the internal load (people, appliances, etc?). When does the space overheat happen? Is there a chance to use free cooling (aka is the outdoor air temperature and humidity good enough at the time that the space overheats)? If you still need to study the radiation and see the effect of your shading design you can use honeybee/radiance and run detailed radiation analysis.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 19, 2017 at 08:38AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1785896", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1785901"}
