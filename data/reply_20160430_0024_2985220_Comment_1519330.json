{"body": "\nHi Cheney,\n\n\n\nyour idea sounds good. If I understood well, you want to filter analysis period and it should show you just the period that goes from 2 hours after the sunrise to 2 hours before the sunset (for example) for each day of the year.<br/>And then, you want to use the vectors which come from the filter above for sun envelopes.<br/>I think it is possible, I'll try to add your idea to sunset/sunrise component as soon as possible. Thanks!\n\n\n\nBest<br/>Antonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "April 30, 2016 at 12:24AM", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519221", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519330"}
