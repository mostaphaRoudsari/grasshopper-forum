{"body": "\nHi Afshin,\n\n1. You're setting the view to parallel which changes the setting. Unless it's really a parallel view you should keep it as perspective.\n\n2. You have the skyType set to \"sunny without sun\" which removes direct component of the sky. That's why there is no shadow. Change the sky type to sunny with sun [0].\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/K0-MtZZF6*9Y4MEIZpLOlW3wvQjJBu4I3BPk9jUmF0E0Ft*o7vELUTyg*6D*HenvxK23v21u6vh*gl1PFBFrcGzuwV-KKDLZ/shadow_study.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/K0-MtZZF6*9Y4MEIZpLOlW3wvQjJBu4I3BPk9jUmF0E0Ft*o7vELUTyg*6D*HenvxK23v21u6vh*gl1PFBFrcGzuwV-KKDLZ/shadow_study.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 8, 2016 at 4:35pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1525939", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1525969"}
