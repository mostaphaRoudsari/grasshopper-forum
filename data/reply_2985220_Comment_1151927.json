{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n1. This is a bug in ColorZones. It happening because when you read the results no result will be available for branch 1, and the component doesn't consider this and fails mapping the values on the zones. Chris is the one who really knows about the component so I leave it to him.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/szrS1FfaDDICokm1nVKuaanpm9wyj1YS94kKt6lkQbObLJQWHPPa*iMnk3wtyhdFeDepaVNlvBuarujBTvXXsh5UoGc-MlCN/colorZone_bug.png?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/szrS1FfaDDICokm1nVKuaanpm9wyj1YS94kKt6lkQbObLJQWHPPa*iMnk3wtyhdFeDepaVNlvBuarujBTvXXsh5UoGc-MlCN/colorZone_bug.png)\n\n\n\n2. I can't see the issue. The naming is consistent on my system. You need to help me with this to get it right! :|\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 19, 2014 at 12:59pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1154765", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151927"}
