{"body": "\nAnton,\n\n\n\nIf you are asking about the multipliers for theavrgTrans, those are meant to relate radiative energy to the human visual system. Lighting calculations, as performed by Radiance/ AGI32/Dialux are basically\u00a0[photopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopic_vision) calculations that intend to describe the brightness of light sources. Although this wikipedia page doesn't do justice to this topic, it is a good starting point to read more on subject: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_function)\n\n\n\nIn very simplistic terms, the values of 0.265, 0.67 and 0.065 \"weight\" the radiation calculated by Radiance and conform them to our visual system. They are used almost everywhere in daylighting simulations inside Radiance when the results are being finalized from RGB triplets to a single Illuminance/Luminance value.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 11, 2016 at 08:47PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1528148", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1528283"}
