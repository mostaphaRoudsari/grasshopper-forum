{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI got a question relate to ASHRAE 90.1-2010 Wall Construction from the EP Construction Library. I found out that the U-value from the EP Library does not match with ASHRAE 90.1-2010 exactly (for example, for Climate zone 1 Extmass Wall, EP Library offers U=0.649, whereas ASHRAE requires max 0.580 using IP Units).\u00a0\n\nThe other question is that is the library updated to ASHRAE 20.1-2013?\n\nThanks!\n\nBest,\n\nRufei\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rufei Wang", "created_at": "April 4, 2016 at 12:16pm", "created_by": "RufeiWang", "topic": "ASHRAE 90.1 Wall Construction", "id": "topic_1500748"}
