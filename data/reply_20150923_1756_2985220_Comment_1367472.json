{"body": "\nHi Elzine,\n\n\n\nAfter I updated the userCustomlibrary.idf (I wasn't aware of this capability) I could work out what you were trying to do with your GH file. I believe that I've solved it, it was a bug in the component Honeybee_Set Ep Zone Interior Construction.\n\n\n\nI have to get this fix synced with github so until I do if you need another \u00a0Honeybee_Set Ep Zone Interior Construction component just copy the components in this GH file!\n\n\n\nLet me know if this GH file is what you wanted,\n\n\n\nCheers\n\n\n\nAnton\n\nuserCustomlibrary\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1367473", "name": "SplitZones_Issue AJZ 23.09.2015.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "September 23, 2015 at 05:56PM", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1366738", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1367472"}
