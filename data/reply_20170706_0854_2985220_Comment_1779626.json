{"body": "\nHi Pramodk,\n\n1. Is this slow when you run it once too or is it happening after running a number of simulations?\n\n2. What is the number of test points? Can you reduce them?\n\n3. Is this only Ladybug or Grasshopper is slow in general? Do you have a lot of data internalized / loaded in GH?
