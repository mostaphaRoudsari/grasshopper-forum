{"body": "\nHas anyone gotten the \"north\" parameter to work in the Run Energy Simulation component? \u00a0I was just trying to rotate the orientation a simple zone and found that I got identical results no matter the number or vector input for north. \u00a0I also got this warning in the output:\n\n\n\n** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: World Coordinate System selected. \u00a0Any non-zero Building/Zone North Axes or non-zero Zone Origins are ignored.\n\n\n\nAfter some troubleshooting, I found that HB set the E+ coordinate system to world, but that for the north parameter to function it needs to be set to \"relative\". \u00a0When I manually set the coordinate system in the IDF editor to relative, the North Axis rotation worked as expected.\n\n\n\nI'm attaching the GH file I was using. \u00a0Perhaps I set something incorrectly?\n\n\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1228988", "name": "03_NorthPar.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Burin", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 12:04AM", "created_by": "Burin", "topic": "E+ Orientation", "id": "topic_1228989"}
