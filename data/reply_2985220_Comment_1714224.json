{"body": "\nHi Willy,\n\n\n\nThanks! Yes I checked the lookupfolder_daylighting component, and the output for ill files is null.\n\nI tried to structure the current 3 ill files into data with 3 branches, and connected that to ill files address, I was able to generate an annual profile, however the readDSHourlyResults showed an error \"1. Number of annual profiles doesn't match the number of shading groups! NOTE: If you have no idea what I'm talking about just disconnect the annual Profiles. In that case the component will give you the results with no dynamic shadings.\"\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cYJbDW7C4z6shLLygOkctCIcnA7EW2vUPlIsM7bCLBGzeNNs7knDHijSTYljzvXqL4FAcU8uL3vp*wo1GJNQDZytmQTIDsfl/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cYJbDW7C4z6shLLygOkctCIcnA7EW2vUPlIsM7bCLBGzeNNs7knDHijSTYljzvXqL4FAcU8uL3vp*wo1GJNQDZytmQTIDsfl/Capture.JPG)\n\n\n\nI also attached the updated gh file and ill files as below. I don't know why the components won't recognize the ill files. Thanks!\n\nThe shade schedule look like below:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/cYJbDW7C4z5AJZeKx4PT*OhxhNes0HIJ283QcgIA*rOgYZo1Prfi1Ug3Ek8I1iOFOUu1uGCa3en4CApo-83BD0yL95XqwOB1/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/cYJbDW7C4z5AJZeKx4PT*OhxhNes0HIJ283QcgIA*rOgYZo1Prfi1Ug3Ek8I1iOFOUu1uGCa3en4CApo-83BD0yL95XqwOB1/Capture.JPG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1714225", "name": "Test_DynamicShading.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1714226", "name": "East_Shade_ill.zip"}], "created_by_name": "XF", "created_at": "March 16, 2017 at 2:40pm", "created_by": "XF", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714136", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714224"}
