{"body": "\nFirst of all thank you very much to help me !\n\nI'm understanding what you did. It's different from what I did. I was\u00a0comparing the values of colors variations (red to blue), in this case june was the highest number. (In my way)\n\nYou put maximum and minimun values to legend par. (And the number was satisfying. Do you know if this results, attached, is in kWh/m\u00b2)\n\nI need to see the image too, not only the numbers, I understand that in your way I saw only the number results, isn't it?\n\nLook the image december and june (attached). June is more \"red\". Like your way results, the corect is the oposit. How could I get corect images ? (understand my question?)\n\nSorry for so many questions\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1759213", "name": "21.06.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1759214", "name": "21.12.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1759215", "name": "Results.png"}], "created_by_name": "Camila Leone", "created_at": "May 28, 2017 at 01:39PM", "created_by": "CamilaLeone", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1759158", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1759212"}
