{"body": "\nHi Guys,\n\nI'm trying to do energy modeling of a typical room considering an office building. So, i built the room only (as surfaces) as a part\u00a0of the building, considering the front wall is an external wall and the rest of the walls are internal walls (side walls and back wall), that goes also for the floor and roof.\n\n\n\nBut now when i'm assigning all the surfaces as HBsurfaces by default HB seems like considering it as external walls cause there is no attached walls or zones. and i cannot pull out interior walls from \"HB decompose base on type\" any suggestion how to solve this issue ?\n\n\n\nappreciate your help\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1481209", "name": "3.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1481510", "name": "1.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1481511", "name": "2.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Ataur Rahman", "created_at": "March 10, 2016 at 08:28AM", "created_by": "AtaurRahman", "topic": "External Walls as Internal Walls HB+LB", "id": "topic_1481512"}
