{"body": "\nI'm having difficulty getting the 'Ladybug_Create Legend' component to work. Any number or panel or analysis results I plug in to the '_valuesOrRange' input sends me a red message 'Need more than 6 values to unpack.' Last week I used the same script and it worked fine. However, I've updated a few components and it is no longer working. I've switched to using a 'Mesh Spray' to create the gradient chart because the 'Re-Color Mesh' tool was giving me too much trouble. I'm just looking to create a legend.\n\n\n\nAnybody have any suggestions?\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1111719", "name": "trouble.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Elliott Freeman", "created_at": "August 06, 2014 at 10:49AM", "created_by": "ElliottFreeman", "topic": "Create Legend", "id": "topic_1111720"}
