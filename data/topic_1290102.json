{"body": "\nI'm having a problem using \"Honeybee_Export to Open Studio.\" I'm getting the error\n\nSolution exception:file does not exist: C:\\Users\\Aaron\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\\OpenStudio\\openStudio.dll\n\nThis seems pretty straight forward that the component cannot locate that file. However the file does exist in the proper location, I'm not sure how to resolve this, I've tried updating and restarting and have had no luck. It's probably something really simple but I appreciate any help!\n\nThank you, Aaron.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" height=\"236\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/yIRAODsxTExEtHeceqdsHGODzmfYMJJXCjhCXxTWaXyTzgEFmceAtIfvzI3gNXe6APuklVG*SFr6yMF1eTYtCoYfVbOy17bt/Capture.JPG?width=750\" width=\"601\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/yIRAODsxTExEtHeceqdsHGODzmfYMJJXCjhCXxTWaXyTzgEFmceAtIfvzI3gNXe6APuklVG*SFr6yMF1eTYtCoYfVbOy17bt/Capture.JPG)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "May 19, 2015 at 3:45pm", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "topic": "OpenStudio Export problem", "id": "topic_1290102"}
