{"body": "\nHi, I have to problems with the attached definition\n\n1. How do you input a geometry for the shadow study component in ladybug? I had a rhino geometry that I set as as reference brep, which I guess it doesn't work. I looked at your sample file and your geometry was a close brep, if that the problem, how do you convert a rhino geometry into a close brep?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pPSIfXxESuyxCCmMcpLUMMR*Lxd34k2Y9Xfzz-cGohAzHifT5sUtvKfvRG7qs-IvphtLNqCKoYc6Gpn3SYSDz8IBIeaWb2VM/0..JPG?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pPSIfXxESuyxCCmMcpLUMMR*Lxd34k2Y9Xfzz-cGohAzHifT5sUtvKfvRG7qs-IvphtLNqCKoYc6Gpn3SYSDz8IBIeaWb2VM/0..JPG)\n\n2. In the sunlight hours component, I'm getting less than 1 hour of sun on a horizontal surface with no obstructions on June 22 at noon in Dallas, TX. Which is not possible, so I do not know what I'm doing wrong, and would appreciate your help very much.<br/>[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pPSIfXxESuwG2vj21Fed-emt0DV*imdawAJVtgyvaxkrrBt2Vc959I8*Ee9TqNBzptPCxzlfURbadlZ9Ei74OKHcg2b1k2L9/0.sun.JPG?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pPSIfXxESuwG2vj21Fed-emt0DV*imdawAJVtgyvaxkrrBt2Vc959I8*Ee9TqNBzptPCxzlfURbadlZ9Ei74OKHcg2b1k2L9/0.sun.JPG)\n\nThank you, gh and 3dm files attached.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1217381", "name": "Solar Study_HZ_extruded.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1217382", "name": "ShadowStudy_test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Helena Zambrano", "created_at": "February 04, 2015 at 03:33PM", "created_by": "HelenaZambrano", "topic": "Closed Brep and Sunlight hours", "id": "topic_1217383"}
