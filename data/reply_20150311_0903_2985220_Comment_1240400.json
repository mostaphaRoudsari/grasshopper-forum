{"body": "\nMade me laugh Chris,\n\nSee attached for the Construction:ComplexFenestrationState definitions. Took them from WINDOW, one of the Sage's glasses (you need also the other file for the matrix of data).\n\nHoking all this to the additionalStrings is not a problem (of course). But how to assign this to the windows? I understand somehow, you decomposed one window and got the coords, etc. But this is a torture to do. Do you think there is a way with the existing components?\n\nAs for the Daylighting Control (which is what made me laugh) i'll try to think something out. We have this problem with our interface. We solved the location of the sensors but no the direction (for glare). So right now they are good only for daylighting level. Also their location is done manually, one by one for each zone. Don't think there is a better way.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1240401", "name": "ThermochromicGlazing_AY1_CWM.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1240402", "name": "ElectrochromicMatrix.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 11, 2015 at 09:03AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240232", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240400"}
