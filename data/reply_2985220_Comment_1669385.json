{"body": "\nHello Mostapaha,\n\nQuick question. If all my context geometry is fixed, can I put them all as additional RAD files and leave HBObjects empty?\n\nI am guessing it doesn't work that way. I get an error saying\u00a0\n\n**1. Input parameter _HBObjects failed to collect data!**\n\n\n\nIf I put my surrounding buildings as brep HBObject and the rest (mullions, columns, etc.) as RAD files... should it work properly?\n\n\n\nThanks!!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saket Sarupria", "created_at": "January 10, 2017 at 2:54am", "created_by": "SaketSarupria", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1583228", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1669385"}
