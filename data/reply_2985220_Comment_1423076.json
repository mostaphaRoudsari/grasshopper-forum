{"body": "\nEduardo,\n\nI am fresh out of ideas about what the problem could be. It is difficult to figure out the issue without being able to re-create it. \u00a0I will see if I can get Mostapha to take a look at this or ask if he has any ideas.\n\nIf anyone else on this forum has experienced this issue or has thoughts about what it could be, please post.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 17, 2015 at 7:54pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1422417", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1423076"}
