{"body": "\nHej again,\n\n\n\nI am trying to prove or disprove (i leave the outcome open) the fact that the position of a room/zone can affect the energy outcome in a mixed function building - meaning that i will try to mix residential and office spaces - in steps, side by side, on top of each other.\n\nAlso this is done to see how hard would it be for architects to implement such a method in concept stage therefore having a more energy efficient design and model. \u00a0\n\nFor example is it more energy efficient to have the staircase in the middle of the building or on the outside? Is it energy efficient to place all the office functions on the north side and the apartments on the south? Of course these questions can be easily answered by common sense but I would like to also prove it and also in the same time analyse the outcome and the percentage of the influence. \u00a0The example you saw was just a test for me to get a hang of the method - I am still learning and analyzing the fastest and best way to do this. Specially when you have a big project. The photo below is just a start up example\u00a0[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/6dxYD0J5Ccpyyvr0t*DsZEZAPrMoT7UL*FuGezUYBmAD0H-1fcenXMqCQHCuGd5hHoWSyY3epoCKx-mdwhQ-bsIpuj5EOxRv/zones.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/6dxYD0J5Ccpyyvr0t*DsZEZAPrMoT7UL*FuGezUYBmAD0H-1fcenXMqCQHCuGd5hHoWSyY3epoCKx-mdwhQ-bsIpuj5EOxRv/zones.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stefania Dinea", "created_at": "February 3, 2016 at 1:20am", "created_by": "StefaniaDinea", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1453071", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1453661"}
