{"body": "\nHi Wesley,\n\nHave you tried to set useOldRes to False and try again? Sometimes the first run of genCumulativeSky goes wrong and then the component load the wrong file.\n\nIf you set useOldRes to False, you should see a cmd window to be open and stay open for few minutes until it generates the sky matrix.
