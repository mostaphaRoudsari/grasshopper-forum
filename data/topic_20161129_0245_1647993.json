{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if there is a way to improve upon the Fly! component. I am currently working on Machine Learning and Parametric Design models using HB and LB. My first case study was a success. It was a simple model with only 23,000 different combinations. The 23,000 lists of parameter combinations were computed at around 20 mins (if memory serves)\n\n\n\nThe second model is a bit more comprehensive and has a total of 360,000 combinations. I am again using the Fly component to cycle through the sliders and produce (through a few native GH components) the 360,000 different combinations of model parameters (one list for every model). But I fear the time it will take will just be too long. It's also hard to say if GH itself has stopped working, since after enabling Fly! the environment freezes. I remember reading somewhere that GH might have an issue with large lists, but not sure if that's true.\n\n\n\nIs there maybe a way for a faster implementation of this? Anyone knows of a GH native way of producing combinations from lists of values (instead of sliders)?\n\n\n\nI could probably some of this outside Rhino/GH/HB/LB but I'd rather not too.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "November 29, 2016 at 02:45AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Fly!
