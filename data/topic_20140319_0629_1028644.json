{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nI started to study Honeybee for a work, thank you for the tool, I'm impressed.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1 - is it possible to consider shadings outside the windows in a Daylight analysis?\n\n2 - is it possible give a material (transparency) to the shadings? It could be different fabrics with different opacities.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "March 19, 2014 at 06:29AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "Shadings in Daylight analysis with Honeybee", "id": "topic_1028644"}
