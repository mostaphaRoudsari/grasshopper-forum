{"body": "\nHi Antonello,\n\nThanks a lot\u00a0for your workflow!\n\nBut I\u00a0have still a question/problem: in\u00a0your\u00a0workflow, you can choose both\u00a0the low and high boundaries, and then you can also decide in how many segments you want to\u00a0divide the legend. Right?\n\nBUT\u00a0how can you define also the values between the boundaries?? As said before, i want to have the following steps: 0.7 (which is the low boundary), 2.2, 3.6 and 5.4 (which is the high boundary).\n\nThanks again\n\nClaudia\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "February 15, 2017 at 08:18AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1691908", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1692315"}
