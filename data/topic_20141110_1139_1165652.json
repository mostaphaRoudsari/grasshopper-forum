{"body": "\nHello All,\n\nI've been trying to run an ep sim on a multizone residential model. However, after running the sim the error report I get detects a lot of severe errors stating:\n\n\n\n** Severe ** Problem in interior solar distribution calculation (CHKBKS)\n\n** ~~~ ** Solar Distribution = FullInteriorExterior will not work in Zone=ZONE_12\n\n** ~~~ ** because vertex 2 of back surface=ZONE_12_SRF_3_SRFP_3 is in front of receiving surface=ZONE_12_SRF_2\n\n** ~~~ ** (Dot Product indicator=17.7603)\n\n** ~~~ ** Check surface geometry; if OK, use Solar Distribution = FullExterior instead.\n\n\n\nI attached my file, thoughts and help are much appreciated!\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1165651", "name": "Multizone_Residence.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "November 10, 2014 at 11:39AM", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "topic": "Interior Solar Distribution Calculation", "id": "topic_1165652"}
