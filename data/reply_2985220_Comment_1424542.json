{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThanks\u00a0 a lot for your reply! It was extremely useful!\n\nAs you said i\u00b4ve straighted the wall and now everything seems to work!!\n\nI have the last question: could you tell me the tollerance of gh and these plugins? or is it the same of rhino? Because\u00a0i know you change\u00a0it in\u00a0rhino, but maybe gh needs different precision than rhino. I think\u00a0could be useful to know\u00a0for a future work!\n\nThanks a lot again!\n\nGreetings\n\nClaudia\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "December 21, 2015 at 1:34am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1423519", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1424542"}
