{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for the response. I admit it frustrates me how novice I am in energy plus. Just a couple of questions if I may. You say that ventilationperArea (in the ep zone loads) will have no effect if the zone is not conditioned. My interest mainly here is to set up mechanical ventilation in non-conditioned zones (e.g. warehouse spaces). By your description this seems to be the case of fandrivenventilation in the NatVent component. Would that be a right guess? And could I input a schedule for this type of ventilation somewhere in honeybee (sorry can't check the component in this pc right now).\n\n\n\nFinally, what would the EP settings assigned to zones in models where only simple parameters were set? For example, what happens to a zone I only assign as non-conditioned in the create zone component? Is it assigned any type of ventilation by EP? Again, I promise I'll go for some EP training so that I won't bother you so much with technical questions!\n\n\n\nThank you so much!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 02, 2015 at 06:58PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1278901", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279062"}
