(**Solution exception:'hb_EPZoneSurface' object has no attribute 'BC')**\n\n\n\nUltimately I would like to input:\n\n1) Multiple Breps - all of the rooms in the building.\n\n2) Multiple Surfaces - all of the windows in the building.\n\n3) Typical RAD materials for floors, ceilings, walls, etc for the building.\n\n\n\nAm I missing something really obvious?\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1127606", "name": "screen.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1127607", "name": "JS_daylightBox.gh"}], "created_by_name": "John Sullivan", "created_at": "September 7, 2014 at 5:40am", "created_by": "JohnSullivan", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1062648", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1127604"}
