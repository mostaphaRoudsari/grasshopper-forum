{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nYour citation from ASHRAE 55 is correct. \u00a0The \"hump\" will go away if you input a windSpeed of 0 into the adaptive chart component. \u00a0Not many people know about the provision for increased air speed in the Adaptive model but it ends up being very useful for design.\n\nAlso, I should note that both ASHRAE and the European adaptive model have this provision for increased air speed. \u00a0For another reference regarding the effect of increased airspeed in both US/EU adaptive models, you can check out the \"Adaptive Method\" of the CBE Comfort Tool:\n\n[http://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/](http://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/)\n\n-Chris\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 16, 2016 at 8:45pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1485795", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1486555"}
