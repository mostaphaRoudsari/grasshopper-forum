{"body": "\nThe intersect masses is good when you have masses to intersect (obvious). In your case there is no such situation. Each zone \"touches\" another one, but no intersection between them. That's why you need \"only\" the solve adjacencies component. There you solve the common walls, etc.\n\nWhat you did in your file is outputting the same objects from the input, and after that you were supposed to apply the solve adjacencies.\n\nAs for your 2, 3, 4 floors with my proposed layout, you didn't internalised the geometry (but it doesn't matter). I can say that i would think about applying anothe solve adjacencies between the floors, since the floor/ceiling surfaces is not solved before the simulation. This in case you want to calculate the thermal influences between floors. If you assume they have the same conditions maybe you can set them as adiabatic.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 28, 2016 at 10:41pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1494662", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1494735"}
