{"body": "\nHi Chris,\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for the great example in the first place.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am using your example file for a quick ASE test. But I notice:\n\nI have a feeling the example may 'overestimate' sunlighthours. But I am only a beginner of GH/LB/HB and probably I misunderstood it somewhere. Could you please let me know your comments? Many thanks!\n\n\n\nCheney\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Cheney", "created_at": "April 29, 2016 at 12:57PM", "created_by": "Cheney", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519160", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1518905"}
