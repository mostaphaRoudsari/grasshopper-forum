The component will return the results itself and you don't need to use readRADResults component.\n\n\n\n3-2) In daylighting simulation RADIANCE doesn't know if the object is a shading or is a wall. All it cares about is the geometry and the assigned material. You can model your shadings as you want as Breps and then pass them through HBSurface, apply desired RADMaterial and add it to the scene. Does it make sense?\n\n\n\n3-3) It is possible. Check advanced example for daylighting simulation -007 ([https://app.box.com/s/znns0dtewd1tclicx74q](https://app.box.com/s/znns0dtewd1tclicx74q)). My suggestion is to spend more time getting yourself comfortable with Grasshopper and Honeybee with simpler examples before jumping to advanced examples.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 07, 2014 at 04:43PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1144785", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1144880"}
