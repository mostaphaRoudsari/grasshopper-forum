{"body": "\nHi Paul,\n\nThanks. I think what you said make sense and maybe for cases like this we should add the last hour.\n\nBack to changing the time zone, I assume you know that your solution will move all the sun positions for all the hours (and not only daylight saving period). The reason that we haven't applied daylight saving hours is the fact that it is different in different countries. Maybe we should add it in a simplified version and give the user the chance to overwrite it similar to your Boolean option ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/118](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/118)).\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 18, 2015 at 8:06pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1203443", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1206756"}
