{"body": "\nHi Claudia,\n\nAttached a (hopefuly) working version.\n\nThere was a need to update a couple of things. As for the WindowShadeGenerator pay attention that you need to set to True the writeEPObjs_ input.\n\nSee blue arrows for more changes as for the newest HB version.\n\nI also marked with bix red X those elements that will be phased out or are not there anymore. We need to get used to those changes.\n\nI left a big question mark for Chris, asking for his advice as what i did is right for the Ideal Loads System. An updated example on Hydra will be helpful. I think i did ok but to be sure .. wait for his answer.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1590845", "name": "20160830_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 30, 2016 at 05:09AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1590603", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1590843"}
