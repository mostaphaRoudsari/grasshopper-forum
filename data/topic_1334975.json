{"body": "\nHi, I am getting some strange results from Ladybug.\u00a0<br/> We are currently working on a project of an industrial facilty in Recife in Brazil, and I am creating some shadows diagrams for a presentation.<br/> <br/> The results look fine in the morning, but when I set the time after 12pm, the angle of the shadows start to look strange, not corresponding with the position of the sun in the sunpath.\u00a0<br/> <br/> I took two screenshots to illustrate the problem. The first one uses the Rhino sun for shading (with the correct location data), and the second uses Ladybug Sunlight analysis.<br/> <br/> Would love to know what you guys from the forum thinks about it.<br/> <br/> Is it a bug? A mistake I made? Just the wrong impression from the sun path being so small and close??<br/>\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1334973", "name": "FROM_RHINOSUN.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1334974", "name": "FROM_LADYBUG.png"}], "created_by_name": "Edson Maruyama", "created_at": "July 31, 2015 at 2:51pm", "created_by": "EdsonMaruyama", "topic": "Weird results from Ladybug", "id": "topic_1334975"}
