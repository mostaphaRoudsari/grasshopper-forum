{"body": "\nhi Chris ,\u00a0\n\nI was watching your honey bee energy simulation videos and try to apply &amp; understand more about honey bee energy simulation outputs , so I tried the EPW file of energy plus website &amp; I got a results but the CC generated file gave me this \u00a0comment :\n\nNo surface information was found in the imported .eio file adjacent to the .csv _resultFileAddress.Data cannot be normalized by surface area and the data tree outputs for surface data will not be grafted by zone.\n\n\n\nattached the file which I'm learning in it's not for a specific case study\u00a0\n\n\n\n&amp; all researchers will\u00a0appreciate your efforts in solving the CC generated weather files to be more accurate :) \u00a0so go on\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1230866", "name": "_building  4 energy simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "February 24, 2015 at 8:26am", "created_by": "monarezk", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1230958", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1230864"}
