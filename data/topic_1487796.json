{"body": "\nHi, everyone, I'm quite new to HB and I was trying to get a thermal comfort map following Chris's code, But there are two main questions.\n\n\n\nA. The E+ simulation get a warning: there are non-convex srf. I have modeled all zones as cubes and not sure why it is still considered as non-convex. I have looked through several posts and it seems like this error will effect the surface temperature simulation which would be not accurate for thermal comfort. But I don't know how to find those surfaces and rebuild the model (some posts mentioned to split the non-convex zone, anyone can give an example about how to do that?)\n\n\n\nB.After hours not figuring out the previous problem, I was thinking about running the thermal map to see how serious the error would effect. And there's come another problem. \u00a0I set a summer day and Before sunset the result seems reasonable, however after 6 pm, the indoor temperature keeps over 38 C ( I used weather file of San Antonio). It seems like my cooling system doesn't work. And I have no clue how to check them out.\n\n\n\nThanks.\n\nQinheng\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1487793", "name": "ThermalcomfMap2.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1487794", "name": "ThermalcomfortMap.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1487795", "name": "nonConvexSrf.png"}], "created_by_name": "Qinheng", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 7:33pm", "created_by": "Qinheng", "topic": "Thermal Map question -- non-convex srf and schedule", "id": "topic_1487796"}
