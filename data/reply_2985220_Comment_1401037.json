{"body": "\nYou have it all covered. One more limitation of Daysim is to model dynamic shadings for multiple windows. This is a very important limitation when it comes to calculating ASE accurately. The only accurate solution that I'm aware of for calculating ASE is Radiance's 3-Phase method. Also be careful about using annual DGP calculation with Daysim ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/243](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/243)). In case you're using annual glare analysis make sure to double check the results by point in time glare analysis.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 15, 2015 at 8:08am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1400155", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1401037"}
