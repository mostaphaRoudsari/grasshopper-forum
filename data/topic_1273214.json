{"body": "\nHello Everyone,\n\n\n\nI am trying to create shadings for an energy simulation to study conditions inside my structure and the effect shading will have on it.\n\n\n\nBut, when I connect the shadings, the HB Context creator is returning an error - \"1. Solution exception:'NoneType' object has no attribute 'Faces' \".\n\nThis is happening when I connect only certain surfaces of my structure.\n\nAlso, the error appears if I connect surfaces that act as walls' for window shading but doesn't appear if I connect surfaces acting as 'roofs' for skylight shading.\n\n\n\nThank you for all your help.\n\n\n\nAmrita\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1273212", "name": "nonetype error.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1273213", "name": "Shell_weather_Wind_Shading_test_msr_ghosh_3.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Amrita Ghosh", "created_at": "April 25, 2015 at 2:44pm", "created_by": "AmritaGhosh", "topic": "Shading Designer - 'nonetype' error - no attribute 'faces'", "id": "topic_1273214"}
