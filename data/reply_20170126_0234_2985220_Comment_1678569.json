{"body": "\nThanks a lot Mostapha,\n\n\n\nAt least for me it will be extremely helpful.\n\nAbout developing AFN, I'm not sure yet about how worthy is\u00a0to use it. The main advantage I'm seeing right now is that it gives data of the air flow between different zones, what can be extremely useful. But I don't completely trust yet my results. So, if you develop it one day, I'll really love to test it and see what I've been doing right and wrong.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julia T", "created_at": "January 26, 2017 at 02:34AM", "created_by": "JuliaT", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678408", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678569"}
