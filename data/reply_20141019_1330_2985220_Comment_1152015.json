{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha,\n\nYes, we discussed the RadiantTempMap before. It was related to the model tolerance. But i don't think it is the problem now, because what i wrote above.\n\nAs for point 2. Let's take for example the zone named \"Core\". It is the 3 in the list of the names at point 1 in file (the same for all other properties there). But it is the second in the brep list. It is like all zones are shifted by one, geometries and properties. I just played wit the order so it will fit.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 19, 2014 at 01:30PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151927", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1152015"}
