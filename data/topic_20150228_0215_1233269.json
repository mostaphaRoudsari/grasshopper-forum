{"body": "\nHi everybody!\n\nI have to design an entire neighborhood, that must addresses the principles of outdoor and indoor comfort and also of sustainability.\n\nSo I need to maximize the sun exposure on the ground, reducing as much as possible the shadow casting, but at the same time I need to maximize the building's sun exposure on the sides facing the South, in order to provide a good radiance for the needs of photovoltaic panels.\n\nI know, maybe it's a paradox the idea of combining this two principles together (they sound like opposites).. But I'd like to know if there is a way to balance a good exposure on the ground with a good exposure on the roofs.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Qyn*Uz1WnG*meWLNAGP*DWgoY-df7eSEAUtqLgyfmNHRjWUoRK8*rLiPqlVDPvnMknhX51dDqUoeW11AuLETbb-XhqOkcFy-/Schermata20150228alle10.05.25.png?width=500\" width=\"500\"/><br/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Qyn*Uz1WnG*meWLNAGP*DWgoY-df7eSEAUtqLgyfmNHRjWUoRK8*rLiPqlVDPvnMknhX51dDqUoeW11AuLETbb-XhqOkcFy-/Schermata20150228alle10.05.25.png)\n\nthe purple guys are the shapes obtained with Ladybug_SolarEnvelope.
