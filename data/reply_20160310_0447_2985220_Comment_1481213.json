{"body": "\nThanks again for the reply. I ran couple of test and below you can see the results in the file. I ran 4 test with my own shades:\n\nno shade\n\nfull shade around the window\n\nhalf of the shade on the top of the window\n\nhalf of the shade on the bottom.\n\nThen I ran two different shades both produced by EPWindowShades. First analysis was ran entirely through the EPWindowShades component, second was just using the created breps and running them through contextsrf component.\u00a0\n\nLooking at the results now I see that they give similar absolute results, but the difference between EPWindowShades-85 kWh and ContextSrf-136kWh is pretty big as a relative difference.\u00a0\n\nAs a conclusion I need to revise my model and check some similar values. If I get anything unusual I will get back here. Thanks again\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1481214", "name": "SHADING_ test.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antoni Balcerzak", "created_at": "March 10, 2016 at 04:47AM", "created_by": "AntoniBalcerzak", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1480945", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1481213"}
