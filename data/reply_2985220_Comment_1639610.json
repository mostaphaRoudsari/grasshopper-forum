{"body": "\nHi Jeremy,\n\nThere are ways to get the surfaces that you need from this model but before that you need to make a bigger decision about how do you want to separate the floors for each zone? This model needs some cleaning to be useful. Can you export the gbXML file based on Rooms and use that model instead?\n\nYou can automate the process of creating zones for for each floor for one of the 4 buildings to get yourself familiar with the process but if you are new to Grasshopper it will be a challenge to manage a model in this scale.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 14, 2016 at 7:39pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1639303", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1639610"}
