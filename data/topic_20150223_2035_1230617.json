{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI am trying to set up a simulation based on daylight calculations. I have managed to calculate my DA numbers and set a lighting schedule out of that.\u00a0I could then link this to energyplus and see the result of the schedule.\n\n\n\nMy problem is that in big zones, especially offices, there are multiple lighting zones. Is there a way to simulate this using Honeybee without splitting my zones into sub-zones. This would increase the simulation time I think?\n\n\n\nIs it perhaps possible to put airwalls and then discard them from the simulation. I guess I'd like to know if I can simulate 1 cooling zone that includes 4 lighting zones (as example) in energy plus, at the same time.\n\n\n\nHope this makes sense. Thanks in advance for the input.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 23, 2015 at 08:35PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "EnergyPlus and Lighting Zones", "id": "topic_1230617"}
