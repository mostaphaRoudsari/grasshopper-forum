{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI am rather new to Grasshopper + Ladybug and am having an issue with Ladybug. I have installed and re-installed Rhino 5, GhPython 0.6.0.3 and Ladybug and Honeybee on my PC, however, when I drag over the main Ladybug default folder onto the canvas I keep receiving an error message \"Solution exception:No module named Grasshopper\".\n\n\n\nI have looked at other posts that address similar problems like this one\u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/1-solution-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/1-solution-exception-no-module-named-rhinoscriptsyntax?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1563808&amp;xg_source=activity&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\n\nbut in my case the paths are ok and the script files in place. I am, however, missing \"scriptcontect.pyc\". Could this be the issue and if so how could I fix it? If not any other thoughts what might be wrong?\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nElina\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elina Spruza Chizmar", "created_at": "September 18, 2016 at 1:41pm", "created_by": "ElinaSpruzaChizmar", "topic": "Solution exception:No module named Grasshopper", "id": "topic_1601563"}
