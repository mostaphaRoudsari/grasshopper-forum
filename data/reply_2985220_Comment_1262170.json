{"body": "\nHi Nita,\n\nGood that you uploaded the file.\n\nI took a look and noticed the error. HB is complaining about a specific wall (windowWall6). I opened the file in openstudio and see that there were also errors there (windows not being coplanar to walls, surface normals pointing inwards, triangulation of surfaces) that made me thing how this file was created (see picture from OS). OS fixed the planarity and i flipped the normals. Then saved the file and reinserted in GH. Now it works, as you can see.\n\nI don't think it is a good example to work with, but of course you can go ahead.\n\nHope it helps,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1262171", "name": "O1_A.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1262172", "name": "O1.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1262173", "name": "O1_A.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 13, 2015 at 9:15am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262165", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262170"}
