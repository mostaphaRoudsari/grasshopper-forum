{"body": "\nHi LucDav,\n\n\n\nSorry for my late reply, I used this method:\n\n[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/epz/wxcalc/wetBulbTdFromRh.pdf](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/epz/wxcalc/wetBulbTdFromRh.pdf)\n\nBefore to choose it, I also tried other methods, such as this one:\n\n[http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JAMC-D-11-0143.1](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JAMC-D-11-0143.1)\n\nBut I think the NOAA method is more complete, especially if you have 100% of RH or extreme temperature values.<br/>If you have found some discrepancies please post them here or open a new discussion as Mostapha told you.<br/>If you have some new formulas or methods more accurate please post the links here, so we can compare the results.\n\n\n\nBest\n\nAntonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "April 11, 2016 at 06:07AM", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1504452", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1505834"}
