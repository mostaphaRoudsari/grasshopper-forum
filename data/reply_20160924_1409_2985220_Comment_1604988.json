{"body": "\nHi Taizo,\n\n\n\nWindow7.4 can infact make XML files with multiple layers that can include films, air gaps etc. Two quick resources that I can point out to you in this regard are Section 3.2.1 of Andy Mcneil's [Three Phase Tutorial](https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/Tutorial-ThreePhaseMethod.pdf) and [Greg Ward's presentation on BSDFs](https://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day2/GW5_BSDFFirstClass.pdf).\n\nHow are the properties of your window film defined? Can they be defined in terms of the standard Radiance primitives like [glass](http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html#Glass), [trans](http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html#Trans) etc.?\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "September 24, 2016 at 02:09PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1605051", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1604988"}
