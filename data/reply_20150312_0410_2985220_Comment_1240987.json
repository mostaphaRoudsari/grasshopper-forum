{"body": "\nhm, i missed this post somehow, this is great!\u00a0\n\nalso made me think about the looking for some tools to turn csv data into a JSON that has some structure like nested columns and etc, sort of like\u00a0[a page like this](http://ocds.open-contracting.org/standard/r/1__0__RC/en/schema/release/). If you push a little plus mark the column will unfold and expand.\n\nI am volunteering currently for this project when I have time [https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/CROL-PDF](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/CROL-PDF)\n\nand there is a discussion of standardizing information extracted from pdfs into csv, then eventually to a json schema so that a large amount of information can be shared easily online and also visualized to allow filtering and making operations on a data set. The closest thing I know is\u00a0[http://openrefine.org/](http://openrefine.org/)\u00a0but it is not an online app and not really a collaborative platform.\n\nanyhow, columns with nested columns showing imgs with tables that corresponds to a set of paramters might be a good suppliment to parallel coordinates. since honeybee and ladybug now has a quite a large collection of analysis so if there is a way to create a pipeline from grasshopper to, yeah, something like github.io like you have it here, with a well designed JSON schema with fold-expand columns it might be a great way to keep track. just an idea, dont know how this could be achieved yet.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "March 12, 2015 at 04:10AM", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "parent_id": "topic_1229503", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240987"}
