{"body": "\nHi everyone, I\u2019m beginner with Ladybug and Honeybee and right now just involving with \u201cGetting Start Tutorials\u201d of both. Everything was Ok until I started to set up a sample scene for using HB and Daylight Simulation and I got \u201c'str' object has no attribute 'type'\u201d error on the component.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I have installed everything correctly and latest versions. Even searched for the problem but couldn\u2019t find the solution. There is a JPEG file of the definition attached and the error in it.\n\n\"Geometries used in the scene are Rhino default geometry (for Surrounding buildings) and GH baked geometry (for the building of interest).\n\nInstallations:\n\n_ladybug0064honeybee0061\n\n_DAYSIM-4.0.0 Installation File\n\n_EnergyPlus-8.7.0-78a111df4a-Windows-x86_64\n\n_ghpython2.gha\n\n_OpenStudio-1.14.0.1205e0bae6-Win64\n\n_radiance-5.0.a.6-win64\n\n\u00a0\n\nI would be glad if anyone can help.
