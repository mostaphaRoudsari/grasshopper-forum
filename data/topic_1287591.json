{"body": "\nDear Mostapha, thank you very much for your kind support on our research.\n\nYour suggestion in the thread\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/problem-set...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/problem-setting-energy-plus-fields-in-honeybee?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1257744&amp;xg_source=msg_com_gr_forum)<br/>\n\nis useful to replace values (even if I cannot replace the same value for example \"fraction radiant\" in two different internal gains), but not to add new stuff, as in our case.\n\nAs you may recall, we were able to add our internal gains through the additional strings, but we have the problem of the default ones that we can not change or remove.\n\n\n\nWe've noticed that People, Lights and ElectricEquipment Internal gains are located inside the \"runEnergySimulation\" honeybee command inside the Python script.\n\nWe were thinking of two possible quick alternatives while waiting to be able to fully customize the internal gains with honeybee.\n\nFor the first one, if it is possible, you could make a \"modified\" \"runEnergySimulation\" command for us in which you cut off the Internal Gain parts, so that we can add them as text in the additional strings part. Alternatively you could show us where to add the additional strings we need inside the runEnergySimulation command so that we can add the values we need to run the simulation.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor clarity, these are the internal gains in idf file we need (that are inside de gh file in the panel just below the additional strings command)\n\nLights,<br/>, !- Name<br/>, !- Zone or ZoneList Name<br/>, !- Schedule Name<br/> Watts/Person, !- Design Level Calculation Method<br/> , !- Lighting Level {W}<br/> , !- Watts per Zone Floor Area {W/m2}<br/> 16, !- Watts per Person {W/person}<br/> 0.2, !- Return Air Fraction<br/> 0.59, !- Fraction Radiant<br/> 0.2, !- Fraction Visible<br/> 0, !- Fraction Replaceable<br/> GeneralLights; !- End-Use Subcategory\n\nPeople,<br/>, !- Name<br/>, !- Zone or ZoneList Name<br/>, !- Number of People Schedule Name<br/> People, !- Number of People Calculation Method<br/> 4, !- Number of People<br/> , !- People per Zone Floor Area {person/m2}<br/> , !- Zone Floor Area per Person {m2/person}<br/> 0.3, !- Fraction Radiant<br/> , !- Sensible Heat Fraction<br/> attivit\u00e0 metabolica, !- Activity Level Schedule Name<br/> 0.0000000382, !- Carbon Dioxide Generation Rate {m3/s-W}<br/> , !- Enable ASHRAE 55 Comfort Warnings<br/> ZoneAveraged, !- Mean Radiant Temperature Calculation Type<br/> , !- Surface Name/Angle Factor List Name<br/>, !- Work Efficiency Schedule Name<br/> ClothingInsulationSchedule, !- Clothing Insulation Calculation Method<br/> , !- Clothing Insulation Calculation Method Schedule Name<br/>, !- Clothing Insulation Schedule Name<br/>, !- Air Velocity Schedule Name<br/> AdaptiveCEN15251; !- Thermal Comfort Model 1 Type\n\nElectricEquipment,<br/>, !- Name<br/>, !- Zone or ZoneList Name<br/>, !- Schedule Name<br/> Watts/Area, !- Design Level Calculation Method<br/> , !- Design Level {W}<br/> 5, !- Watts per Zone Floor Area {W/m2}<br/> , !- Watts per Person {W/person}<br/> 0, !- Fraction Latent<br/> 0.3, !- Fraction Radiant<br/> 0, !- Fraction Lost<br/> General; !- End-Use Subcategory\n\n\n\nThank you very much!<br/>Filippo\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1287589", "name": "userCustomEPLibrary.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1287590", "name": "HB_TEST_1505.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Filippo", "created_at": "May 15, 2015 at 11:52am", "created_by": "Filippo", "topic": "Internal Gains editing in Honeybee", "id": "topic_1287591"}
