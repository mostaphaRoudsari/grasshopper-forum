{"body": "\nHello Rebeca,\n\n\n\nConnecting galapagos with Ladybug is quite easy.\n\n\n\nAll you need to do is to connect a number of parameters (e.g. sliders) to galapagos, these will be your genomes. In your case I imagine that the critical variable is the shape of the roof, so you can connect the any number of sliders you are using to define different shapes. Then you should connect the result of your radiation analysis to the fitness input of galapagos. Double click on galapagos and run the simulation (you might want to consider to lower the populations in your first runs).\n\n\n\nFor more into evolutionary optimization galapagos has a number of documents you can go over.\n\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "June 10, 2015 at 09:15PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1307248", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1307325"}
