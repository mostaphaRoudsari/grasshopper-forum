{"body": "\nThanks Chris.\n\n\n\nI'll try and search around myself, although I'm sure I'm at a disadvantage here.\n\n\n\nI wonder if we can set up a small experiment and test this out? Perhaps a simple geometry that would leave all methods on an equal footing (i.e. no convex funny stuff).\n\n\n\nI don't have the time today but I'll set it up within the week.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 11, 2016 at 03:48AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435439", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1436219"}
