{"body": "\nEdwin,\n\nIt's usually a good idea to start simpler and then you can work your way to complex geometries. \u00a0I would recommend just getting your simulation to work with a box or a dodecahedron and then you can work your way to more complex geometries. \u00a0Alternatively, a simpler study like a Ladybug solar radiation analysis may be all the you need to evaluate whether a given facet of your shape should be glazed or opaque.\n\nIn any case, I can recognize one major error in your file is that you have tried to add windows as HBSurfaces. \u00a0For energy simulations, windows must always be assigned as sub-surfaces of base surfaces.\n\n\n\nSee these videos:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rCgP0zSiPY&amp;index=6&amp;list=PL...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rCgP0zSiPY&amp;index=6&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md6LFS6cwc0&amp;index=14&amp;list=P...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md6LFS6cwc0&amp;index=14&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_)\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 6, 2017 at 5:28am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1779557", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1779491"}
