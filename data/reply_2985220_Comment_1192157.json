{"body": "\nArtem,\n\nThat E+ object seems like something that we should implement. \u00a0I have been struggling a bit recently to find the best way to implement control objects for a few constructions like the surface control you mention and the blinds control discussed here:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/midpane-bli...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/midpane-blind-in-honeybee-grasshopper?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1187038&amp;xg_source=msg_com_gr_forum)\n\nI see this as something that I will need for my work this upcoming semester and so I can tell you that I will implement it within 3 months if no one else does sooner.\n\nFirst on my agenda is a set of natural ventilation objects, though, which also seem to be in demand by a lot of people on this thread.\n\n\n\nI second your call for focusing on passive strategies. \u00a0I feel that the energy modeling community these days is undergoing something similar to that which happened to the aerospace industry over the last couple of decades. \u00a0Namely, where all of these crazy innovative technologies were created with the aim of space exploration and yet most significant impacts that the industry has created have been in terms of satellite images and communications around Earth. \u00a0Similarly, many innovative energy modelling technologies have been created with the aim of enabling digitally-controlled smart walls and vacuum insulated structures and yet the most widespread impacts have tended to be in terms of assessment of passive design strategies. \u00a0The ways in which technologies are sold during development versus how they used in applications are interesting.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 20, 2014 at 8:27am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1188930", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1192157"}
