{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI have just realised that my answer got cut after the first sentence.\n\nI will look at the examples you mentioned.\n\nIn regards to the Solar Adjusted Temperature component, I guess it is appropriate to use it both for external and internal comfort evaluations given the paper used as a reference in the description of the component and that you also mentioned? Is it a matter of 'just' using the proper inputs depending on whether we are interested in external or internal comfort evaluation?\n\nMany thanks again for your help.\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nCarmelo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carmelo G.
