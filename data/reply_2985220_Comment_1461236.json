{"body": "\nAre you reading the idf file back for visualization? In that case the simulation is fine. The reason that you see the surfaces on top of each other is that Rhino fails to subtract the window from the base surface and you see two co-planar surfaces in view which is what Tim mentioned. This doesn't change the results for energy simulation as EnergyPlus takes the full surfaces for wall and window.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 4:23pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1460710", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1461236"}
