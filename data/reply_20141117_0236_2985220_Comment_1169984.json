{"body": "\nHey Chris and Mustapha\n\nThanks for your replies. I now know\u00a0that E+ have difficulties with non-planar meshes. I updated the file to approximate the a sphere with planar surfaces instead of non-planar smaller surfaces\u00a0(**mesh sphere ex** is not the best choice i see). The initialization stage is now ~ 1 sec. I think (I'm not the expert here so correct me if I'm wrong) the problem has something to do with EP's method to solve adjacent surfaces when parent and child surfs are non-planar.\n\nWhat exactly is happening behind the scene when EP is initializing?\n\n\n\n/Kristoffer\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1169986", "name": "flux_test_planar-parent-child.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Kristoffer Negendahl", "created_at": "November 17, 2014 at 02:36AM", "created_by": "KristofferNegendahl", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1169344", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1169984"}
