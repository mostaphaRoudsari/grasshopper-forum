{"body": "\nYes it is.\n\nIf you search in the group you'll find that this issue has been discussed plenty.\n\nIn the development of the components sometimes they change the amount of input/output items. When that happen there is no other option than reinserting such components!!\n\nFortunately normally they are not so many.\n\nNow, think about the alternative. Would you prefer to do that for ALL updated components. I'm sure you are not.\n\nSo i think we all should be thankful with Mostapha and Chris for bringing this update possibility, EVEN when there are cases when you have to do some of the work yourself.\n\nHopefully in the future they will overcome this issue. Or maybe any of us will collaborate to find the proper solution. What do you say?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 13, 2015 at 11:16am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1342846", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1343050"}
