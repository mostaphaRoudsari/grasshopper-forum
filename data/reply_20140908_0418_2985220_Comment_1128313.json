{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for elaborating with an example. I have updated to the latest version of Honeybee and used the Mesh2Rad utility and it works quite quickly now - fast enough, in any case, to deal with the geometry I have in mind. There is only the additional step of meshing complex geometry manually in Rhino first, but that is a surmountable obstacle.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nReinier\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reinier Zeldenrust", "created_at": "September 08, 2014 at 04:18AM", "created_by": "ReinierZeldenrust", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1127450", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1128313"}
