{"body": "\nHey All,\n\n\n\nI am trying to run a ray tracing off a geometry that has reflective ( a mirror base - red) and non reflective parts (opaque sticks - black) as in the photo. I tried assigning honeybee materials to them but the component still seems to be reflecting the rays off all of the surfaces.\n\n\n\nIs there another component i could use to get the visualization of the ray lines?\u00a0\n\nThank you\n\n\n\nGabriella\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1736784", "name": "HB.png"}], "created_by_name": "Gabriella Rossi", "created_at": "April 21, 2017 at 4:49am", "created_by": "GabriellaRossi", "topic": "Differential Material RayTracing", "id": "topic_1736785"}
