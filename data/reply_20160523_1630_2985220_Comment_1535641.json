{"body": "\nFrancesco,\n\nYour comfort evaluation surface definitely had some points that were inside the zone geometry. \u00a0When the surface is right at the ground level, Rhino may think that the surface is actually inside the zone. \u00a0I would move your comfort evaluation surface to be 1 meter off the ground in order to be representative of typical human height. \u00a0\n\nAlso, you did not intersect the ground with the rest of the zone geometry, resulting in an incorrect energy simulation. \u00a0After intersection, you also get one surface of the ground zone that is not inside any buildings. \u00a0I fixed these two things in the attached file ad it works:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"undefined\"/>](http://undefined)\n\nI would also recommend breaking the top surface of the ground up into sub-surfaces so that you can capture the variation in ground surface temperature that happens across the outdoors. \u00a0Second, I would recommend putting some windows on your buildings as the exterior surface temperature of windows can be very different than that of opaque surfaces. \u00a0Finally, you should keep in mind that the outdoor maps are assuming a very basic outdoor wind profile by default and, to accurately understand outdoor comfort, you really should be incorporating wind patterns after running a CFD. \u00a0This discussion has some information about importing CFD from other programs to GH:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/import-cfd-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/import-cfd-result-to-honeybee)\n\n<br/>-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 23, 2016 at 04:30PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1535086", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535641"}
