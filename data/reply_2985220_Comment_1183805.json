{"body": "\nThanks Chris! You are the man. This should be good enough for Masoome to work on her project.\n\nAbraham, I hear you and as we already discussed ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/idf-import-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/idf-import-and-setepzonethresholds-issues?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1179934&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)) we need to add shadings in general. I personally want to make sure that we add them generic enough in a way that we don't have to write so many methods for each individual EP object. There are so many of them!\n\nAn alternative is to move all these features to OpenStudio component? What do you think about that?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 8, 2014 at 7:47pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183106", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183805"}
