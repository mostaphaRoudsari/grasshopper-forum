{"body": "\nSarith is right. Grasshopper is incapable of loading internalized python objects so it cast the \"unknown type\" to a string. There might be a way to internalize them if we wrap them in a grasshopper object but I have never tested it.\n\nWe can also enhance the performance of the current parser to load the matrix faster. I re-wrote the parser for the new ladybug but that one should also be improved. It's just a matter of time! :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 5, 2017 at 7:45am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1727684", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1727792"}
