{"body": "\nDevang,\n\nyes I understood the principle that you say is at the base of this calculation but\n\nI don\u00b4t understand its validity. In this moment I cannot make any test but I think that if it works in that way then when you try different grid sizes (number of test points) the results will be different. Is it so? Is this a valid way to make studies?\n\nWhen I mention the word \"mystery\" I didn\u00b4t mean how the component works, but why then I don\u00b4t get the same result using the calculation you say and from the output totalSunlightHours. I attach again the same image of my previous post if you missed it.\u00a0\n\nYes probably we will receive clarifications soon.\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Fxq0VavCSuCJBkPNyNGrL6p1cFLVZ-33ucnhgxExR1mbPHv6AFQh6Vr6zgjnNwHXhEvxm22eiLvUQjwsrIC8dCBJ6evkeboO/2.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Fxq0VavCSuCJBkPNyNGrL6p1cFLVZ-33ucnhgxExR1mbPHv6AFQh6Vr6zgjnNwHXhEvxm22eiLvUQjwsrIC8dCBJ6evkeboO/2.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "January 17, 2017 at 7:56am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1673600", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1673605"}
