{"body": "\nHi Yassin, thanks for this - will have a look at your script!\n\nYes, I took the same approach - remapping values from 0 to 1 for all objectives, however, haven't worked out yet how to copy all the meshes into rhino so that is my next step. I am guessing that once they are all in the same range (i.e. 0 to 1) you can start adding/subtracting them to get your best performing solution or you could even weight the objectives based on your own criteria (i.e. daylight more important than cooling load). Hope this makes sense! :)\n\n\n\nBest\u00a0\n\n\n\nDan\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Danijel Rusovan", "created_at": "February 19, 2016 at 02:34AM", "created_by": "DanijelRusovan", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1466831", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1466855"}
