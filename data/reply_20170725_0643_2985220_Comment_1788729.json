{"body": "\nHi Antonello,\n\n\n\nThank you for looking into this. I understand what you're saying. However, I am still struggling with this. I receive True values for all the intersections, which does not seem right. I also changed the context so that some rays can directly hit the corner points of the window.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/BDuwXwZXcryEut9W35dnvESbMzAAWdlmzR879h-v3bZy*WKdltvCUohAtvcCDOIPDGMCq59oTTpNBSpp-dVdIQLLORnaSWOY/shadingDesigner.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/BDuwXwZXcryEut9W35dnvESbMzAAWdlmzR879h-v3bZy*WKdltvCUohAtvcCDOIPDGMCq59oTTpNBSpp-dVdIQLLORnaSWOY/shadingDesigner.png)\n\nHowever, I still get the same result.\n\n\n\nI have attached the file again. Is it the case that this is happening on my machine only? Does it work fine at your end?\n\n<br/>I am wondering if there's something wrong with my GH definition or should I dig deeper into the code for this one.\n\n\n\nThank you!<br/>-Devang\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1788731", "name": "ShadingDesigner.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "July 25, 2017 at 06:43AM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1788651", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1788729"}
