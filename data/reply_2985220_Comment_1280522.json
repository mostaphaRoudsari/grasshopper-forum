{"body": "\nHi Ding,\n\nBoth simulations may share schedules (light) but they definitely don't share daylight considerations. While the Radiance does it, the E+ doesn't at ALL. If you check the IDF created you'll see that there is no Daylighting class. So i assume that in your case the light is on all the time as specified by the schedule. That's probably the reason you get such a difference in the results.\n\nPlease see this discussion to get updated about the status of the daylighting in HB+E+:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-daylight...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-daylight-setpoint-bug)\n\nRight now it is not working, so you really can't rely in the E+ result so far.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 4, 2015 at 10:32pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280189", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280522"}
