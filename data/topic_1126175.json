{"body": "\nHelp! I'm getting the error that 'createHBZones is not defined'. I don't think it's a problem with the geometry, it's all closed polysurfaces. I thought maybe my honeybee was out of date so I reinstalled and re-dropped the update and honeybee_honeybee components and ran them. Still not working, what am I doing wrong?!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHi Aaron. It sounds like a problem that comes with using an older version of Honeybee_Honeybee with a newer version of other components. I recently added a versionCompatability check to all the components so if you are using updated components it should give you a warning! I am not sure why updateHoneybee didn't really update your components. I think I need to add few lines to remove the old version before copying the new ones.\u00a0\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIt seems this \"_createHBzones is not defined\" happens for a bunch of other components as well (\"_xxxx is not defined\"). I don't believe I'm updating wrong, I'm just dropping the _Update Honeybee onto the canvas and running it (i then redropped Honeybee_Honeybee onto the canvas and tried to update again, same error). All of the components update to the Aug_25_2014 version except the _Update Honeybee itself, which is still at Mar_17_2014. I noticed that the image you attached has a different honeybee icon and is for Sep_3_2014. I also am curious about the _splitbuilding Masses component and the building zone/office zone programs component as those aren't existent as a tools in my honeybee library. I'm assuming this has something to do with the updating issue as well?\n\n\n\nI really appreciate the help, thank you!\n\n\n\nAaron\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "September 4, 2014 at 8:36am", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "topic": "Honeybee Update problems", "id": "topic_1126175"}
