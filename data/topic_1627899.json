{"body": "\nI am having trouble finding a way to turn off Mechanical Ventilation as an output that factors into the peak cooling load. I am trying to compare my results to a coworkers results in another Energy modeler (Trace) so we're trying to get out models to be as similar as possible. His model does not account for Mechanical Ventilation in his cooling load as we're going to be using a slightly more complex ventilation system. I attached high point may.png because the red value on may 8th seems to be offsetting the cooling results.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI've set ventilation per area and per person to zero so there must be something else that I am missing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn a slightly different note the cooling load graph generated through the energy balance component is inverted in colors and sign. It's not to big of a deal because it's easy to notice and work around but if I create a 3d chart from just the readEPresults for cooling, the output is opposite colors and \u00a0has a positive sign compared to the Energy Balance graph.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1627901", "name": "SouthWest Corner Room_Flat Windows.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1628081", "name": "high point may.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1628082", "name": "high point may scale.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Zack", "created_at": "October 28, 2016 at 7:56am", "created_by": "ZackSickman", "topic": "Mechanical Ventilation", "id": "topic_1627899"}
