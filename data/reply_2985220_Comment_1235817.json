{"body": "\nThanks I got it to work!\n\n\n\nI would like to ask a clarification regarding the difference between the **shadeNetEffect** and the **energySavedByShade**. I am not sure when they are kWh/m2 and when kWh.\n\n\n\nI understand the shadeNetEffect to be kWh and the energySavedByShade to be kWh/m2? Is that Correct?\n\n\n\nIf that s the case and I have 100% at the percenttoKeep input, shouldn't that return the shadeNetEffect when multiplying the mass addition of energySavedByShade with total shade area?\n\n\n\nAlso how do you get the legend with Degree-Day/meters2?\n\n\n\nThanks up front!\n\n\n\nDimtiris\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1235818", "name": "Shade_Benefit_Analysis.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1235819", "name": "Shade_Benefit_Evaluation_01.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "March 3, 2015 at 12:03pm", "created_by": "doompop", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1235124", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1235817"}
