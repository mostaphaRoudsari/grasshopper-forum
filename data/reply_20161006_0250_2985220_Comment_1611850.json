{"body": "\nHi Sarith,\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply!\n\n\n\nThe ab = 2 is just for testing purposes until I can get the components to work as intended.\n\n\n\nNot sure if I follow you completely. I might lack knowledge how Daysim operates, but why would you need 5 different simulations if you have 5 different thresholds? During one simulation can't Daysim switch between different slat states according to different thresholds of the external sensor?\n\nJust to clarify with my Q1 above, I want the blind to be controlled by an external sensor with 5 different irradiance/illuminance thresholds, and measure the illuminance on a grid in the room to see the effects of the blind.\n\n\n\nAnyone got anything to add to Q3? As I said any help is appreciated.\n\n\n\nAll the best\n\nMikael\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "M.
