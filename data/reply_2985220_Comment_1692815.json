{"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\nI get a look at your file and ... it is working for me as is.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2Ch3eJPqYM1VaYyZ-0mdQgCJWA7gpTMGelJBVmr2-mbd6Bo99HHNM46fIrKtY8XffO1om-VJ35V*XVFB1i4wE9L/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2Ch3eJPqYM1VaYyZ-0mdQgCJWA7gpTMGelJBVmr2-mbd6Bo99HHNM46fIrKtY8XffO1om-VJ35V*XVFB1i4wE9L/Capture.JPG)Though a needed to set the path for LB_LB and HB_HB. Since to be that the last update force that the default is now at the .../Roaming/... location and not also at C:\\Ladybug (as both of them were allowed before). After that it worked fine.\n\nI would check, anyways, also the tolerance of Rhino (mine is 0.001). Not sure this can be, but please check.\n\nIf nothing of this helps, test the component to identify the code line where the error is happenning. This can be helpful for debuging.\n\nAttached the file that i \"touched\".\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1692817", "name": "Rebuilding_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 16, 2017 at 12:27am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1692684", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1692815"}
