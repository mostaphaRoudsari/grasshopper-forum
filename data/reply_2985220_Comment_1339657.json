{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nThank you finding this bug! \u00a0This was an old one that would have messed things up even before the ability to accept data trees of legendPar. \u00a0It resulted from the fact that the epw data was in units of \"C\" and the UTCI component was in units of \"\u00b0C\". \u00a0It has been fixed in the attached file and in the version of the bar chart that I just put on the github.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1339658", "name": "MultipleDataBarChart6.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 6, 2015 at 7:08pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1339512", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1339657"}
