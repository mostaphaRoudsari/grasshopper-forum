{"body": "\nMostapha, this is fantastic! I had OpenFOAM running in Ubuntu before but it has been some time. now I have a more powerful computer so I installed OpenFOAM for Windows. Both the indoor and outdoor simulations are working, visualized in GH. I am a sailor and hydrofoil designer so ultimately want to get to free surface effect simulations. I would not say I am so experienced because I am starting over with OpenFOAM after a few years break, but I have accomplished simulations using Rhino models before, dual booting Windows and Ubuntu, and have all of it working in Windows 10 now. I'm having trouble opening these results in ParaView. I'm not sure if that means much, so far I get similar errors opening the work I copied from Ubuntu to Windows...\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rick Loheed", "created_at": "October 22, 2016 at 08:44AM", "created_by": "RichardWLoheedII", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1622935", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1623109"}
