{"body": "\nThankyou Abram!! It works and this is exactly the kind of thermal simulation that I needed!\n\n\n\nI have added this \"setRADMaterials\" in the DEFINE ZONE section (attachment - 1 screenshot..09.59.28) of Chris' Microclimate Map, because I need to process the simulation including the information about the materials of my buildings. The simulation runs but I cannot find any differences in the result betweeen very low avarage diffuse reflectance and very high avarage diffuse reflectance materials (last two attachments). If you look at the pictures they are identical but they come from two different simulations with completely different materials, it seems that the material has not been processed at all. Do you guys think that what I did makes sense or that I should add the material somewhere else?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks agian,\n\n\n\nValerio\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1657536", "name": "Screenshot 2016-12-14 09.59.28.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1657537", "name": "Screenshot 2016-12-13 17.03.55.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1657538", "name": "Screenshot 2016-12-13 16.57.58.png"}], "created_by_name": "Valerio Soldera", "created_at": "December 14, 2016 at 2:20am", "created_by": "ValerioSoldera", "parent_id": "topic_1651524", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1657535"}
