{"body": "\nHi Stefania,\n\n\n\n500 zones seems an insane amount and I would highly suggest using simplified methods. For example, when modelling a building in EnergyPlus/SketchUp, you would normally just model the zones which would vary for the rest depending on its location and 'multiply' it, with its surfaces attached to itself... in very simplified studies, these normally meant just looking at perimeter zones and core, and then the top, bottom and middle floors. In the below example, the middle floors 'floor' and 'roof' are surface matched to each other to represent the thermal exchange to a floor so similar, that it is basically the same floor. Obviously this example will not work for daylighting, but for energy it does the trick.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UNLKhjTj3qvUHj1sxH11vWTeAwFYXSDyd3IHQBEXBWIC2LXFQF5mWRsiAWdld4tJi1ZN*VqB0dq3Kha4XVEHiHYHH9eD8OjW/SimplifiedExample.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UNLKhjTj3qvUHj1sxH11vWTeAwFYXSDyd3IHQBEXBWIC2LXFQF5mWRsiAWdld4tJi1ZN*VqB0dq3Kha4XVEHiHYHH9eD8OjW/SimplifiedExample.JPG)I'm not sure how this can help you, as I have not played around in HB from this aspect to try duplicate it.\n\n\n\nPerhaps if you told us what you wish to complish? You can move to different zones within HB quite easily using item selectors... perhaps I'm not understanding what you want to do?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "February 02, 2016 at 01:30PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1452702", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1453071"}
