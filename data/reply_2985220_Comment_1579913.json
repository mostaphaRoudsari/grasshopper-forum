{"body": "\nHey Mostapha,\n\nthanks a lot for the file... I checked the whole model again and cleaned it up, so it should be alright now. But unfortunately when I try to export, it still won't work.\n\nI can export two floors at a time, when I add a third floor, Rhino crashes again.So I've tried Chris' method and exported several osm files, each with 2 floors in them (the top floor with the single zone can be exported together with the 2 underlying floors). But merging the files in Sketchup doesn't work either (I've tried both suggested methods).\n\nThe cleaned file is attached. Maybe you could try again if it works on your computer?\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\nPS: You are better at remembering than me ;) But I'd love to see a video for that some day!\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1579914", "name": "hotel.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Albert Pressler", "created_at": "August 10, 2016 at 12:36pm", "created_by": "AlbertPressler", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579915", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579913"}
