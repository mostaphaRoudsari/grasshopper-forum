{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nthanks a lot for your answer, i have tried your component and it is really useful but it doesn\u00b4t\u00a0really solve my \"time consuming\"-problem.\n\nAs you can see from\u00a0the image attached in\u00a0my first message, i am running an energy simulation to get the operative temperature\u00a0on each cell of the grid during the hottest week of the year.\n\nSo actually through your component i have just saved the time for the energyplus simulation, which is 1/10 of the time that the Microclimate map analysis spends (i guess that in my workflow that\u00a0is the component which takes much more time to process)..\n\nBecause i have tried to\u00a0get the result running simultaneously\u00a0two files with the same\u00a0workflow, one with your component (recalling the energyplus results from the folder) and one without (so it has to run again the energyplus), and it tooks the same time.\n\nI don\u00b4t know if i express well everything, but is there a way to recall also the result of the operativeTempMtx ?\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "August 01, 2016 at 03:29AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1572643", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1574081"}
