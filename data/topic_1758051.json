{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, and everyone!\n\n\u00a0\n\nI simulated some days and hours using ladybug e honeybee and I set S\u00e3o Paulo epw.\n\nSo, the december is the summer and june winter.\u00a0**The corectly result would be december, march, september, june**.\n\nI did two kind of simulation. The first one - just one hour 10h and then 15:30. The second, 10:00 to 15:30h. I think that's something wrong with the results kWh/m\u00b2 because the biggest values for radiation, are for winter. And the results simulation 10:00 to 15:30h the result are different too, the biggest values for winter (june), then september, march, and them december (summer)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe results are (kWh/m\u00b2)\n\n10:00h \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 15:30h \u00a0 \u00a0 10 to15:30h\n\n**21/03**\u00a00,69 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01,15 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02,61\n\n**21/06**\u00a01,14 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01,13 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03,71\n\n**23/09**\u00a00,96 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00,90 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02,79\n\n**21/12**\u00a01,31 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01,22 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02,45\n\n\u00a0\n\nI will be very gratiful with your answer I'm using this software to a important academic work, and in my Country Its not commom use this software, I don't know anyone that could help me with this. I'd like to encourage university start to use this kind of software.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you\n\n\u00a0\n\nCamila\n\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">\u00a0</font>\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1758049", "name": "RadiationAnalysis.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1758050", "name": "BRA_Sao.Paulo-Congonhas.837800_SWERA.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Camila Leone", "created_at": "May 25, 2017 at 8:50pm", "created_by": "CamilaLeone", "topic": "Problems with radiation result", "id": "topic_1758051"}
