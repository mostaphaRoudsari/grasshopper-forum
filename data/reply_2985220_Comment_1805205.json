{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nSorry for the delayed response.\n\nIt will be great to have the Passive Solar Heating strategy implemented in the chart.\n\nI agree with your comments. Basically when you have to do with actual design. On the other side i see the potential of \"guiding\" designers BEFORE they have any sketch line for the building and they want to understand the potential of the different passive strategies. This is how i relate to the bioclimatic chart. Now i'm in the \"dilemma\" of which chart to use in class. The bioclimatic one is more intuitive but there is a lot of work to do and until now i neglected it since i released it (just a few small fixes). What worries me about this one is that it shows a very high percentage results ofr each strategy (maybe caused by weird weather data). I need to find the time to make this one more consistent and robust.\n\nThe psychometric is nice, less intuitive but more robust (at least for my initial purposes).\n\nIn case you get to implement the passive solar heating i'll probably go for it.\n\n\n\nAs for the shading strategy i understand and agree. I relate to it as a \"statement\" of the importance of the strategy that of course needs to be well checked and refined during the design process.\n\nThe list of the polygons is fine (evaporative cooling, Thermal mass + night vent, Natural vent, and Passive solar heating).\n\n\n\nI'll keep following this discussion and on the github to see if there are some developments.\n\n\n\nThanks. This is an interesting discussion.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "yesterday", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1801648", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1805205"}
