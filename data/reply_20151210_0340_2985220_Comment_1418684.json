{"body": "\nClaudio,\n\nIn the BlindOnHorizontalWindowCopy file that you attached above change on the HB_EPWindowShades (original-AlwaysON) the _depth input to 1 (or maybe less).\n\nWhen bigger than that you get the following message on the white ballon:\n\n2. Note that E+ does not like shading depths greater than 1. HBObjWShades will not be generated.\u00a0 shadeBreps will still be produced and you can account for these shades using a 'Honeybee_EP Context Surfaces' component.\n\nShades are supposed to be created but only as context, not as blinds.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 10, 2015 at 03:40AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1418668", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1418684"}
