{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\n\n\nWeatherAnalytics makes you pay for EPW data that they fabricate from other climate data sets. \u00a0This \"fabrication\" process is proprietary and known only to them, such that I am a bit skeptical of it. \u00a0Sometimes, WeatherAnalytics is your only option but make sure that you check the EnergyPlus user group weather files before going to them:\n\n[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/EnergyPlus_Support/files/Meteon...](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/EnergyPlus_Support/files/Meteonorm_Weather_Files/)\n\nYou have to make an account for the E+ yahoo group to access these files but, for the epw file access, it is definitely worth it.\n\n\n\nAlso, hopefully Dragonfly will give us a means of \"fabricating\" epw data in a manner that is open and we are aware of the assumptions ([https://github.com/chriswmackey/Dragonfly](https://github.com/chriswmackey/Dragonfly)). \u00a0When the dragonfly is past it's pupa stage in a few more months, I will post back here.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 17, 2015 at 11:50AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1378451", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1380865"}
