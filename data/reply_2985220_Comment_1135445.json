{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nSorry, I forgot to internalise the data!! I suspected that decomoposeByType works only for the zone.\u00a0\n\nSo, I saw this solution in an other discussion but I\u00a0thought that is not my case because I need a variable glazing ratio and it seems to be a \"static\" solution.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe in order to use this component I can prepare a set of window with different size and then choose one from a list.\u00a0What do you think? \u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for the help.\n\n\n\nCheers,\u00a0\n\nGiuseppe.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "September 22, 2014 at 2:20am", "created_by": "GiuseppeDM", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1135106", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1135445"}
