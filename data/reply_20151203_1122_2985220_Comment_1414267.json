{"body": "\nTim,\n\nThanks for the 50 cents and I am admittedly not that familiar with the rhino\u00a0-ViewCapturetoFile command. \u00a0When I capture images, I typically use the \"Ladybug_Capture View\" component:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2iuP6rjeNNK92Eme0-zmCwCLIOHnrfPYY6mf5TV14VIH7MpfzsGyvhMvg68I8ePDEiBfgXpKCMBssiz7eAPecZoC0XS0hkis/CaputreView.JPG\" width=\"682\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2iuP6rjeNNK92Eme0-zmCwCLIOHnrfPYY6mf5TV14VIH7MpfzsGyvhMvg68I8ePDEiBfgXpKCMBssiz7eAPecZoC0XS0hkis/CaputreView.JPG)\n\nIt enables me to have a lot of control over the captured view and to create png animations by automating the taking of pictures when I animate a slider in GH. \u00a0With this, I am usually using a white Rhino background and not capturing transparency. \u00a0If the transparency is particularly important, I might suggest baking the geometry and using Rhino render.\n\nLet me know if any of this is helpful and if it addresses the issue.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 03, 2015 at 11:22AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1410967", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1414267"}
