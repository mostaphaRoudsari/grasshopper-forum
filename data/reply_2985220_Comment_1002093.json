{"body": "\nSorry for bothering with an annoying issue.\n\nI have installed latests grasshopper (0.9.0069), phyton and ladybug.\n\nWhen I try to use any ladybug component there is a strange behaviour: I can drop any component on the canvas but only once; the second time I try i get the warning that \"the user object could not be created as the base type is missing\" (see attached screenshot). Same thing happens when I try to add components to an old definition that contains ladybug components.\n\nWhat could be wrong?\n\nThanks a lot in advance.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1002095", "name": "ladybug_issue.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Giorgio Ponzo", "created_at": "February 3, 2014 at 3:54pm", "created_by": "GiorgioPonzo", "parent_id": "topic_966496", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1002093"}
