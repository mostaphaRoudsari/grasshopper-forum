{"body": "\nHi Antoine,\n\n\n\nThank you for your interest in these components, unfortunately they haven't been given the love and attention that they deserve as I have been so busy these past few months.\n\n\n\nThe issue here is that the schedule Always On is not being written to the IDF file so the generators can't find it and it the simulation crashes.\n\n\n\nI'll talk to Mostapha about this as I believe he has changed some code, this is why this problem is occurring.\n\n\n\nFind the working model attached. You will need to use the Run E+ component in this Grasshopper file for now.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot more functionality that I want to add with these components and they still need to be clean up a fair bit, let me know if you have any suggestions or questions!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1539548", "name": "PV HB AS 5.31.2016.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "May 31, 2016 at 10:09AM", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1538778", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1539547"}
