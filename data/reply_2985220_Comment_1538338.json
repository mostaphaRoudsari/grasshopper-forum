{"body": "\nDear djordje.<br/> <br/> I am so amazed your tremendous help on this small problem I was facing. Your explanations are very informative and comprehensive about how to use the components that people like me would gain sufficient knowledge PV in general.\n\nOk. You should supply all of those facade elements to the\u00a0**context_**\u00a0input, regardless if they are glass or opaque panels.\n\nThis make everything clear and I am able to do some experiment from now on. My apologies for the confusion that makes you waste your precious time constantly on the same issue over and over again. Maybe it\u2019s better for me to read some literature before doing the simulation.\n\nIndeed, I really appreciate for your help and assistance, if there is such paper exists especially on this component, I would love to cite it for my thesis work. <br/> <br/> Have a great weekend.\n\n<br/> Kind regards.<br/> Amaraa.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "May 29, 2016 at 2:27am", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1538235", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1538338"}
