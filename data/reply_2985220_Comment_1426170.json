{"body": "\nI went around GitHub for a bit, there seem to be a lot of interesting projects on ABM.\n\n\n\nWhat is good for us, I suppose, is that most of them seem to be built on the Python environment, like\n\n\n\npyabm ([https://github.com/azvoleff/pyabm](https://github.com/azvoleff/pyabm)),\n\nagentum ([https://github.com/unthingable/Agentum](https://github.com/unthingable/Agentum)),\n\n\n\nand the perhaps the most promising looking\n\n\n\nmesa ([https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa)).\n\n\n\nWould being coded in python make it easier for someone to port them in GH?\n\n\n\nThere are also some others written in javascript like agentbase ([https://github.com/wybo/agentbase](https://github.com/wybo/agentbase)). Another potential interesting project is focusing on crowd dynamics ([https://github.com/VT-ESM-CrowdDynamics/model](https://github.com/VT-ESM-CrowdDynamics/model)) which might be relevant for us.\n\n\n\nFinally, there's pandora ([https://github.com/xrubio/pandora](https://github.com/xrubio/pandora)), a framework that can scale up to handle complex simulations. I would imagine this fits to the type of simulations we would want to do.\n\n\n\nThis is just a first read of course, I will give a try in some of them hopefully. I hope this is helpful.\n\n\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "December 24, 2015 at 7:36pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1425955", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1426170"}
