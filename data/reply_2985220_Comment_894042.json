{"body": "\nDear Mostapha,\n\nThanks a lot for your response, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, or if it is I didn\u2019t get it. Attached is the file I am working on right now (my apologies for it is so messy). There is one \"Nemed View\" called \u201cSun Path 2\u201d saved where you may change the \"hour\" slider and see how the facade would react respectively. I do not need radiation analysis (it would be great if I could have it though) and \"Sunlight Hour Analysis\" would be enough for me. Also, I only need to be able to run a day long analysis not a year around (again if I could have it, it would be great). Right now however, I'm stuck where I still have to work on facade's movements but I do not know whether I would be able to evaluate them. I would appreciate it if you could take a look at the file and see if you could come up with a solution. By the way, it's not important, but I work on Los Angeles weather file. kheili az lotfet mamnonam.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nEhsan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A894044", "name": "Test 5.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Seyed Ehsan Ayatollah", "created_at": "July 29, 2013 at 11:22pm", "created_by": "SeyedEhsanAyatollah", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_893851", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_894042"}
