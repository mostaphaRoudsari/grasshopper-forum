{"body": "\nHi Daniel,\n\nAttached 2 working files. See the \"old\" one (150605). I draw red arrows to point what i've changed. The one that points to the HB_Surface indicates that i flattened the walls and in the panel i defined it as Multiline (this is the more important thing!!). The other 2 arrows indicate that i updated and reinserted those components. I performed an update for the file but there was a need of reinserting those becouse the number of input items changed.\n\nNow both files should work for you.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1302750", "name": "150605_SETUP_AY.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1302751", "name": "150606_SETUP_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 04, 2015 at 10:32AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1302714", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1302749"}
