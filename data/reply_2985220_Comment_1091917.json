{"body": "\nHi Ding,\n\nI'm modifying solve adjacency component ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/75](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/75)). I answered to your questions inside the file. It exports gbXML file.\n\nIf you have a github account I suggest you to send the issues to github as these components are still under development, otherwise it is fine to send them here.\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1091919", "name": "GrizzlyBeartest_msr.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1091920", "name": "GrizzlyBeartest_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 21, 2014 at 6:23pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1091719", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1091917"}
