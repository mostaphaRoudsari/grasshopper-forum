{"body": "\nShort info about some updates to Ladybug Photovoltaics components:\n\nUp until now Ladybug Photovoltaics components have only be able to use a default-defined modules, with \"Photovoltaics Module\" component.<br/>Thanks to Jason Sensibaugh, now it is possible to chose more than 500 custom crystalline silicon and thin film modules from [Sandia Modules Library](https://sam.nrel.gov/libraries), with the new \"Import Sandia Photovoltaics Module\" component. A small example is attached below.<br/>So yes, from now on, the Ladybug Photovoltaics component supports thin-film modules as well.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/xp4MOnsuJ4SI-lLC6zTmzo6QLMsATdMsOIVfH3NcOsr*atKshA9AfjVbL7y7EK4fsarN7ZwxU-tNppskYJAJDawq4Riko7XR/SandiaModulesLibrary.png?width=150\" width=\"150\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/xp4MOnsuJ4SI-lLC6zTmzo6QLMsATdMsOIVfH3NcOsr*atKshA9AfjVbL7y7EK4fsarN7ZwxU-tNppskYJAJDawq4Riko7XR/SandiaModulesLibrary.png)\n\n\n\n<br/>Also \"Tilt and Orientation Factor\" component now has an **analysisPeriod_** input to support calculations of optimal tilt and azimuth angles for particular time of the year, instead of it being fixed to the whole year period, which was previously the case.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1721350", "name": "new_Import Sandia Photovoltaics Module_component.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "March 26, 2017 at 06:57PM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "topic_1309523", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1721349"}
