{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n<br/>I am trying to simulate a model of dual axis solar tracking shading device (integrated with PV)\u00a0**to calculate the amount of electricity produced from the PV also the shading performance of the tracking shading devices**. The idea is illustrated in the attached figure. I have used OpenStudio SketchUp Plugin to model the building and simulate the energy performance of the building using OpenStudio software, but now I need to model and simulate this tracking system, is it possible to perform this in honeybee\u00a0or OpenStudio? This is not a static system as you know and it should be responding to the Sun's movement during the simulation runtime period.\n\nThank you in advance\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hardi Barznji", "created_at": "September 7, 2017 at 2:03pm", "created_by": "HardiBarznji", "topic": "Simulation of Solar traking shading devices (Integrated with PV)", "id": "topic_1810197"}
