{"body": "\nHi Chris Thanks for taking care and sorry for the late response. I'm on the roads ...\n\nI updated my file and now both options are working. I'll start fading the runEnergySimulation and implementing the exportToOpenStudio in my files and future works. Then i'll let you know if i find more issues.\n\nAs for my schedule, you are right. It is supposed to be conected to the Occupancy and not the Activity (bad eyes :-) ).\n\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 28, 2016 at 07:48AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570935", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1572486"}
