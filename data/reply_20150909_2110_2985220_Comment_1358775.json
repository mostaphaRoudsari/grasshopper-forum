{"body": "\nHi Antonio,\n\n\n\nNot sure I can be much help but I will try to put some thoughts on paper anyways. I haven't really used the component but I am imagining that what it does is creates (natural and other) ventilation in or between zones. Now this ventilation has to come from somewhere. Usually, it comes from the outside, so the temperature and humidity of the incoming air completely depends on the place in the world and your options in outdoorTempForNatVent. I am not sure if there can be an addition here to also allow for humidity. Perhaps a nice workaround for this (if outside air is the case) is through Ladybug. We could open the .epw data and select only those moments within the year where the temperature and humidity conditions are within the desired limits. Then that can be used to create a schedule for natvent (again not sure how we would link this schedule to the component but I'm sure Chris and Mostapha will know this).\n\n\n\nHowever, in your case it seems you want this ventilation to come from other zones. That would mean that you would want specific temperature and humidity conditions for these zones (since you want your interzone ventilation with specific values on these). In that case I don't understand completely what E+ will be simulating. It's job mainly seems to be exactly to acquire those temperature for you. The way I see it you could try and condition your model near those conditions you want for each zone and then just allow for natvent between those zones, with a specific flow rate.\n\n\n\nBut tbh, when you absolutely need to set humidity and temperature for the interzone airflow, then that sounds more and more like a job for CFD and not E+.\n\n\n\nHope this makes somse sense.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "September 09, 2015 at 09:10PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1357445", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1358775"}
