{"body": "\nMelissa,\n\nWhat is the question that you want to answer with the analysis? I don't understand what are you trying to do with all those \"sunny\" hours. There are, for instance, standards that require minimum exposure hours for some day on the year (say, 21.12). Let's say you get X hours, what do you want to do with this result?\n\nJune = 720 hours (not 744), but not all of them are daylight hours.\n\n\n\nThis is not so helpful for you but i think it is important to know why you do what you do ...\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 6, 2017 at 11:13am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1706293", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1706524"}
