{"body": "\nHi Guys,\n\n\n\nThis is my first post here and I am extremely new to Rhino-Grasshopper-LB+HB operations so please excuse me if I come across uninformed. First of, thanks for creating this tool and making it freely available!\n\n\n\nI am proposing a project for my final year thesis in which I am looking at mitigating measures for the UHI effect and the repercussions this has for thermal comfort and increases in energy demand. I have noticed the potential of Ladybug / Honeybee for climatic simulations and was wondering if it there was potential for using it for my exact purposes.\n\n\n\nI want to validate different urban greening situations such as green roofs and green facades as well as increased tree and park coverage etc against a base case urban situation to show that improvements to urban greening can reduce UHI impacts.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to incorporate variations of green space in a model using LB+HB? In what way would this be accounted for? Also, is there any functionality within LB+HB to estimate energy demands for these different situations?\n\n\n\nI also have a final question about .epw files which is whether or not there was a way of transforming these so that they are location specific. For example, the Energy+ .epw file I am currently using is from a site approx. 50km as the crow flies from where I am concerned.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nDeclan Fay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Declan Fay", "created_at": "March 22, 2017 at 9:14am", "created_by": "DeclanFay", "topic": "Mitigating UHI effects with Vegetation", "id": "topic_1718518"}
