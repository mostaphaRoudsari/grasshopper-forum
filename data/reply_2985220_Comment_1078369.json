{"body": "\nHi Claudio. I'm traveling right now and cannot check your file, but couple of questions that might help.\n\n\n\n1. In case of dynamic blinds where do you put your sensors? There is a component that let you check the annual results for a single point during the year. You can use that to see if the sensor point ever reaches the threshold.\n\n\n\n2. What is the number that you defined for LP? Daysim does a simple multiplication between hours, lighting power, etc.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 26, 2014 at 6:34am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1077642", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1078369"}
