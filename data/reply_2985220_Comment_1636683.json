{"body": "\nWhen I did expensive optimization calcs I also experienced several problems with stability. I found that it was hard to trace these when using the interface of Octopus, so I switched to OctopusE coupled with Excel instead. Each simulation was given an ID-code so that it was easy to organize and errorcheck. It allowed me to also batch run the same optimization on parallel computers, and various other workflow improvements. I wont go back to Octopus after that. But, it was a bit of work understanding it, for me. You need to read the papers of how the SPEA2 algorithm works and so on. And the octopus forums are pretty silent..<br/><br/>Anyway, just a tip if you dont solve this any easier way.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "November 10, 2016 at 9:01am", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1636812", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1636683"}
