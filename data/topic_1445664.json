{"body": "\nHey everyone,\n\n\n\nI've run into a problem with a few components where I get an error saying: \"You need a newer version of Honeybee to use this component, and if you already have updated Honeybee then delete the component and try to drag it back into the canvas.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\nI've already tried to update through the \"update Honeybee\" component, checking the Food4Rhino website if the versions is up to date, replace the faulty components as well as restarting the program. But nothing has worked so far.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI've noticed problems with following components:\n\nHoneybee_Decompose EP Material\n\nHoneybee_Immport IDF\n\n\n\nAny ideas to what might cause this error?\n\n\n\nThank you for your help :)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1445661", "name": "M0018131-32.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1445662", "name": "Decompose EP Material.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1445663", "name": "Import IDF.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Nickolaj Feldt Jensen", "created_at": "January 23, 2016 at 9:37am", "created_by": "NickolajFeldtJensen", "topic": "Error: You need a newer version of Honeybee to use this component", "id": "topic_1445664"}
