{"body": "\nI was doing a very brief research on this a while back and I came across an interesting article:\n\n\n\nEnergy Simulation of vertical greenery systems, Wong et al. 2009, Energy and Buildings.\n\n\n\nIt was interesting for two reasons. One, it gave an example of U calculation of a typical green wall system (values could be similar for a green roof) which allows for the simulation of greenery over a wall or roof material. The system was something like the below (with the interesting r-values attached):\n\n\n\nLAYER\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R-value\n\nOutside air film\n\nTurfing\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.360\n\nSubstrate (0.1m)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.923\n\nAir gap (0.1m)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWall\n\nInside air film\n\nThe second reasons was an equation they were using to calculate the shading coefficient of the greenery. In the literature, the leaf density is usually correlated with the shading coefficient of the greenery, which makes sense. This isn't as interesting for green roofs but it does provide a simple way to simulate green walls over fenestration. The correlation equation between LAI and SC was this one:\n\n\n\nShading coefficient (y) = -0.3043 x Leaf area index (x) + 0.8112\n\n\n\nI used this equation in a couple of examples to calculate the SC of vertical green walls.\n\n\n\nHope this is interesting.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 12, 2015 at 12:43AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240706", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1241036"}
