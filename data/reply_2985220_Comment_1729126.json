{"body": "\nHello!\n\n\n\nYou can change Uref at the ABLConditions file itself. If you open your case folder, navigate to 0/ or 0.org/ and open ABLConditions file. You will find the Uref input there.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, I imagine you could try connecting your Wind tunnel component directly to the solution component (the end of your file). If you then change your Uref there (at the input of wind velocity of the wind tunnel component) and press true on write case only it should update your 0 folder without re-running blockMesh and/or SHM.\n\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 6, 2017 at 9:48pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1728763", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1729126"}
