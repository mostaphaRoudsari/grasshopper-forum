{"body": "\nChelle,\n\nThere's a small correction that should be made to Mostapha's comment. \u00a0We do have the ability to model fans but it is a simple implementation that will require you to answer the question of where fresh outdoor air is being pulled in by this fan. \u00a0If fresh air is just being pulled in from a window or outdoor grille in the bathroom zone, you can use the NatVent component to easily model this fan. \u00a0Part 3 of this example file shows you how to set up such a fan:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Natural_Ventilation&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\nIf fresh air is being pulled from neighboring zones, then you have to set up a series of mixing objects between zones if you want to be super-accurate and this can get a bit messy. \u00a0In this case, I might just account for the extra heating/cooling energy from the bathroom fan by increasing the ventilationPerArea of the source zone using the \"Set EnergyPlus Zone Loads\" component. \u00a0Overall, I imagine that such fans are not going to greatly impact your energy use unless they are always on or on for all occupied hours.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 30, 2016 at 10:17pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1494718", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1497076"}
