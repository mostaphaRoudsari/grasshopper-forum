Assuming you assigned such a material to any input of radianceMaterial, i'm surprised you didn't get an error.\n\nWhy don't you just leave the holes on the wall clean (no geometry there)? In case you need to have the opening geometry, define your own material as completely transparent (RGB transmittance = 1)?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 12, 2016 at 10:32AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1637782", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1638115"}
