{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nWhile the curved geometry certainly makes the simulation unnecessarily long and is to blame for the CHKBKS in this case, Luis's issue here as to why the surfaces were not being colored was of a different nature. \u00a0From what I have found, it was actually related to zone names. \u00a0Luis had connected the same input for zoneName and zoneProgram in order to avoid duplicate names:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/rFmq0S5l0CIQ1yI4tCADPStXOyBZ*UgD5b*bpqKCQGs3mqAJduWcOKRgIIvcHXM1rLFuqVBQXeTi3B*t3dJfoaKUWD4AEI2p/ProgramEqualsName.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/rFmq0S5l0CIQ1yI4tCADPStXOyBZ*UgD5b*bpqKCQGs3mqAJduWcOKRgIIvcHXM1rLFuqVBQXeTi3B*t3dJfoaKUWD4AEI2p/ProgramEqualsName.JPG)\n\nThis should normally be fine. \u00a0However, the insertion of the \":\" in the zone name completely messes up my script for parsing the zone names, which parses it out of the eio using the \":\" as a separator. \u00a0Accordingly, I added a .replace() for this character whenever it is included in a zone name. \u00a0While I was at it, I also put in a bit of code that senses the number of other zones on the canvas to avoid the duplicate name issue that prompted this issue in the first place (it's an issue that has been bugging me for a while):\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/e01ab83c5a1fe6b...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/e01ab83c5a1fe6bc39be8dd8c5cdd012c4d70465)\n\nLuis, you can find your working GH file attached. \u00a0The\u00a0CHKBKS issue is discussed on many other discussions so I will not cover it further here:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interior-so...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interior-solar-distribution-calculation)\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/energy-plus...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/energy-plus-simulation-error)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1471240", "name": "simple_exp100216_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 24, 2016 at 09:43PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463162", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1471238"}
