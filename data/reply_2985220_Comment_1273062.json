{"body": "\nBump.\n\n\n\nIt's probably a silly question. But as I'm now at my 68th zone of the building I'm getting a bit scared on the prospect of going back and changing orientation of vertical walls. Especially since I internalized everything :(\n\n\n\nAnd an additional probably trivial question. Is it dangerous to not assign the same (adjoining) surfaces to adjoining zones and instead extrude a new surface from the same curve? I am pretty sure this is what solving adjacencies component checks and resolves but need a sanity check. Also need to get rid of bad habits while 3d modeling, it's a longer process.\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 25, 2015 at 10:27pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1272017", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1273062"}
