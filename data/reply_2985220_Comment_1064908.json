{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Giuseppe,\n\n\n\nAs far as I can see Ladybug runs fine on your system. Why are you concerned about ladybug problems?\n\n\n\nBack to Honeybee, the error happens when the component tries to create the folder c:\\ladybug on your system. I assume you have already the folder created on your system (since Ladybug is running fine). If not can you create c:\\ladybug manually and try again?\n\n\n\nI have never seen this error before. Let me know if it solves the issue.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 5, 2014 at 8:22pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1064882", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1064908"}
