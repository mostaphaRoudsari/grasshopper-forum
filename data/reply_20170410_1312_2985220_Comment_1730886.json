{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks! To 2.1: yes I noticed that if I don't assign any min/max Illuminance for DSShadingState, the shade will be the manually controlled. Other than that and glare control recipe, I didn't find any other input to specify the control mode. Please let me know if I'm missing something here.\u00a0\n\nOver the weekend I tried different settings of min/max illuminance, and found something wrong with my setting:\n\nIdeally State 1 is only in use between 1-9999 lux and State 2 is only in use when it's above 10000 lux (on the sensor point). However in the component, the min illuminance is for the blind to open, and max illuminance is for the blind to close.\n\nIf I set State 1 (min 0 max 1), State 1 will be in use when it's above 1 lux; Then I set State 2 (min 9999 max 10000), State 2 will be in use when it's above 10000 lux; Then from the inter gain csv file, I found State 2 stays even after the illuminance dropped back to less than 9999 lux.\u00a0\n\nBased on the\u00a0[daysim example](http://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-shading-control-modes), State 2 should go back to State 1 when the sensor illuminance drops below the min illuminance set. Am I doing something wrong that led to this error?\n\n\n\nThanks so much!\n\nBest,\n\nXF\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "XF", "created_at": "April 10, 2017 at 01:12PM", "created_by": "XF", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1730743", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1730886"}
