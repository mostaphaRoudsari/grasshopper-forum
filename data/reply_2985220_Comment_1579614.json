{"body": "\nAlbert,\n\n\n\nThanks for the clean file that recreates the error. \u00a0Unfortunately, the error seems to be on McNeel's or OpenStudio's side of things and I don't know if there is much we can do to help on our end. \u00a0I checked the error log in VisualStudio and it seems the error is the following:\n\nAn unhandled exception of type 'System.StackOverflowException' occurred in RhinoCommon.dll\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/S8fITn3Ibtsun3RubnPlqWRyyOr8brMzk5wawKjD*usYLbpFtVkh2waKH3ABmw0*6m6AbJw0*VwIEc8gxvws7Rm89C1A3zF2/DotNETException.JPG\" width=\"412\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/S8fITn3Ibtsun3RubnPlqWRyyOr8brMzk5wawKjD*usYLbpFtVkh2waKH3ABmw0*6m6AbJw0*VwIEc8gxvws7Rm89C1A3zF2/DotNETException.JPG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/S8fITn3IbttZ0q96r-jyrPfyjbVGqEDdXZ7w9TiaVb62QMdbbH9Sb8XaKF5jb8l8d9X54oTiwzxYTIYC*iNbeGB13AAKQlrW/DotNETException2.JPG\" width=\"456\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/S8fITn3IbttZ0q96r-jyrPfyjbVGqEDdXZ7w9TiaVb62QMdbbH9Sb8XaKF5jb8l8d9X54oTiwzxYTIYC*iNbeGB13AAKQlrW/DotNETException2.JPG)\n\n\n\nOne thing I can say is that the GH script will probably run if you export the building in two steps (each with half the zones) and try to merge the teo files in the OpenStudio interface using the method posted here:\n\n[https://unmethours.com/question/3951/merge-two-openstudio-files/](https://unmethours.com/question/3951/merge-two-openstudio-files/)\n\n\n\nI know it's hacky but let me know if you get the chance to try that out.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 9, 2016 at 4:17pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1579132", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579614"}
