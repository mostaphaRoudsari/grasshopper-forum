{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nI checked your file. If you intersect the zones before solving adjacency everything should work fine. As you know in EnergyPlus adjacent surfaces should be exactly the same so solving adjacency between big box and the small box is unexpected for component!\n\nAlso you need to rename the zones if you are using two different components to generate zones. I think I need to add more warnings for this all over the place. Check red circles.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1180575", "name": "AdjacencyIssue_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 3, 2014 at 6:43pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1180025", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1180573"}
