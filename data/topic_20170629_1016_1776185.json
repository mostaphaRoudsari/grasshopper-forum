{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nI'm working on a masterplan looking at the outdoor comfort performance of its streets and pavements.\n\nI'm using the Honeybee microclimate map tools as the basis for this but wondered if there's any way of reusing the viewFactorInfo without having to recalculate every-time I open the GH file.\n\nFor a sense of scale I'm trying to determine the view factor between approximately 30000 points and 450 surfaces - which (according to some **wild** extrapolation) would take around 2.5 hours on my machine to calculate.\n\nI though of perhaps writing the viewFactorInfo to file to reload - but as its stored in IronPython.Runtime.List format this is proving a bit more difficult even with Giulio's handy conversion script.\n\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions about how to either speed up the calculation process or serialising the output to re-load later?\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tristan Gerrish", "created_at": "June 29, 2017 at 10:16AM", "created_by": "TristanGerrish", "topic": "Storing IndoorViewFactor viewFactorInfo", "id": "topic_1776185"}
