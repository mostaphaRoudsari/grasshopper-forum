{"body": "\nHi, guys,\n\nI\u2019m starting to learn Honeybee and I\u2019m getting this error when I try to run one of the most basic simulations (with the component \u2018run daylight analysis\u2019). I\u2019m getting the following message:\n\n1.Solution exception: unable to find file 'C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\\radiancetest\\imageBasedSimulation\\error.log'.\n\nThe model was based on a youtube workshop by Mostapha (1/7). The file is so simple (I got stuck in the first video), but I\u2019m sending it attached anyway. Prior to this error, I got a message about gendaylit (I found the file and saved it in the proper folder).\n\nI\u2019m assuming that there might be some files that are missing in some folders. I never had such problems with Ladybug, only with Honeybee (eve though the message refers to the Ladybug folder).\n\nI appreciate your help!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1602738", "name": "honeybee-1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "RLima", "created_at": "September 20, 2016 at 06:34AM", "created_by": "RLima", "topic": "Honeybee: unable to find error.log file", "id": "topic_1602739"}
