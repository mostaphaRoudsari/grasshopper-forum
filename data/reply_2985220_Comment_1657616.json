{"body": "\nHi Roy,\n\n\n\n\n\nSure. It's very easy. Find Honeybee_Update Honeybee component. It is in tab 12. Once you have that component on canvas, do the following.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8kkt4Vvp7GwTSagKL48fBD2zjHZ9rssDMgTdToUaGrqgkoCSAvcQcJ9pacgk7VHA3eI9VVXty80h5U7B*60XntYYVRoAwhsO/ScreenClip.png\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/8kkt4Vvp7GwTSagKL48fBD2zjHZ9rssDMgTdToUaGrqgkoCSAvcQcJ9pacgk7VHA3eI9VVXty80h5U7B*60XntYYVRoAwhsO/ScreenClip.png)It will take a few seconds to update your components. You can also update all the Honeybee objects ( the ones you don't have on canvas as well) by attaching a boolean toggle to _updateAllUobjects.\n\n\n\nTo update Ladybug, the process is quite similar. For that you use Ladybug_Update Ladybug found in tab 6.\n\n\n\n-Devang\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "December 14, 2016 at 2:59am", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "topic_1655380", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1657616"}
