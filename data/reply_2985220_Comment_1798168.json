{"body": "\nHi everyone!\n\nI seem to encounter the same issue \u00a0with the read annual results I. There is a continuous issue with this component and it shows me the error 'Solution exception out of range' even though the simulations have been run correctly and the number of results and the number of test points match as well.\u00a0\n\nThe other read annual results II always works. Or is this a bug in Daysim, as Mostapha mentioned in another post?\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\nAnurag\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anurag Verma", "created_at": "August 14, 2017 at 5:32am", "created_by": "AnuragVerma", "parent_id": "topic_1449181", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1798168"}
