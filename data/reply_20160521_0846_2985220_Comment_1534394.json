{"body": "\nHi Djordje,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for looking into this. I understand why the component is like that, I just misjudged the part about grafting because in my case I have both wind and solar radiation being different on each grid point, but still that would not be any problem if I kept it grafted. Once more I went the long way to a simple problem.\n\n\n\nThanks again for your time and for the amazing tools. I will definitely have a look into the new Tmrt code.\u00a0\n\n\n\nkeep up the amazing work.\n\n\n\n-Byron\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "byron mardas", "created_at": "May 21, 2016 at 08:46AM", "created_by": "byronmardas", "parent_id": "topic_1534360", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1534394"}
