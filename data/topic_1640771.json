{"body": "\nHello All,\n\n\n\nI am in the process of learning Honeybee and \u00a0am trying to generate an EUI for a simple geometry and am looking for a tutorial or some guidance on how I should go about doing that.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Idea is that I can do a series of iterations using Grasshopper and quickly have ladybug/honeybee estimate the EUI of the geometry. (the geometry would take the climate information from ladybug into consideration.)\n\n\n\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated! I tried looking through the forum but didn't find something that fit the above description.\n\n\n\nThank you in Advance!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "November 16, 2016 at 12:49pm", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "topic": "Calculating EUI", "id": "topic_1640771"}
