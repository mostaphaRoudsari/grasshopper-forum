{"body": "Jakob and Mauricio,\n\nWhile there may be some validity to the statement that E+ doesn't have an easy means of dynamically altering ALL properties of materials, you can absolutely simulate electrochromic glazing and most types of dynamic shading very easily in E+. Testing out the effects of new technologies like ECs is one of the primary reasons why E+ was started and I can say as a general rule of thumb that you should be able to simulate any building technology in recent history with E+ if you are willing to dig deep enough.\n\nTo run E+ models with ECs using honeybee, you should check out this example file:\nhttp://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&for...\n\nIn the file, you will see that it is very easy to have a temperature setpoint for the electrochromic glazing. To account for glare, you can either add an additional radiation setpoint onto the temperature setpoint or create a custom csv schedule from the DAYSIM results that dynamically drives the shading state.\n\nI can also say that, while Radiance is just a rendering engine that isn't running a dynamic simulation per se, DAYSIM is made to run daylight calculations over the whole year and you can set dynamic blinds, which will be pulled down if glare is sensed. To use these DAYSIM dynamic blinds with Honeybee, you should use the DSParameters component and the shading group components.\n\nLet me know if any questions arise as you work with these, Jakob.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 30, 2016 at 07:16AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1496356", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1496670"}
