{"body": "\nThanks for the answer Chris. I think I meant simple and not simpler then, I was pretty sure the first option was averaging across all surfaces.\n\n\n\nIt sounds as if it is not even straightforward to break up zones into convex shapes, I never knew the positioning of the virtual partition would be a problem. View factor distribution doesn't sound all that bad I guess. When I get the time I'll set up a simple room and test the whole thing out.\n\n\n\nWho knows, maybe in 3 years I'll know how to read E+ code and I'll help :)\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 4, 2016 at 6:37pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1430512", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1430657"}
