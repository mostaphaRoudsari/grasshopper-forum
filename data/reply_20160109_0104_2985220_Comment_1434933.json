{"body": "\nS221B,\n\nIn my opinion you are approaching this wrongly. There are a couple of options:\n\n1. As you did, but you are modeling the blind with thickness. If you keep with this approach just stick with a plain surface (re-model the profile just as one curve and not as a profile. The profile is what is \"killing\" the simulation, even though you get results.\n\n2. Using the native HB_EPWindowShades which will give you all you need, i think.\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 09, 2016 at 01:04AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1434587", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1434933"}
