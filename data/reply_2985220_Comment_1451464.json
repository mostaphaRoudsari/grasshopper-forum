{"body": "\nHello Everyone,\n\nSorry for being so late here. \u00a0I have put in a bit of code to stop the component from failing and you can find this in the attached file.\n\nStill, I wish I could make this component work in all cases but, as I mentioned in the tutorial video, it is not going to be possible to make a component that will work for all cases (there were just too many bugs in Rhinocommon that came to the surface when I was writing this one).\n\nOne thought that I have had is to separate this component into one that splits masses into floors, which I know can be written to never fail, and another that splits flors into core/perimeter, which won't work in all cases but I can get better control over the failures this way.\n\nLet me know if this will be helpful and I will add it to the github issues.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1451466", "name": "split zone error_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 31, 2016 at 7:30pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1438899", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1451464"}
