{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nBased on your comments and the feedback that I got from someone else using the microclimate maps, I have decided to make a small change to the component, which should allow you to get out the results on a zone-by-zone or region-by-region basis more easily:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/502f6ca26cdca22...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/502f6ca26cdca22bd8a6b04b9b2d82647501bf9a)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pM70oMcIKzNm2BwyBrs02wQ5k*f9Fg4cuaV*kJ83xzdNSyJYLdJ8dkHAwjFGd1-ifQAgodOrAeZTgXh-ne*Y964XlLyaYX85/ZoneByZoneMicroclimateResults.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pM70oMcIKzNm2BwyBrs02wQ5k*f9Fg4cuaV*kJ83xzdNSyJYLdJ8dkHAwjFGd1-ifQAgodOrAeZTgXh-ne*Y964XlLyaYX85/ZoneByZoneMicroclimateResults.JPG)\n\nThe viewFactor component no longer tries to join all of the meshes together when you plug in custom surfaces to distFromFloorRoSrf. \u00a0So, if you use the method in the attached file, you should always be able to get results organized on a zone-by-zone basis. \u00a0This will also work if you need results on a region-by-region basis within a zone or continuous air volume by plugging in multiple, disconnected surfaces.\n\nLet me know if this addresses your issue.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1651566", "name": "Indoor_Microclimate_Map_CustomSrfs3.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 04, 2016 at 11:09AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1651738", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1651565"}
