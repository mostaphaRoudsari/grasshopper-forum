{"body": "\nHi Ding and Michal,\n\n\n\nDing, As Michal said you can create a hole (e.g. air wall) in Honeybee. Honeybee won't take care of mixing the air between the zones which shouldn't be an issue in your case since you can handle that in DB.\n\n\n\nMichal, There is currently 3 different types floor, ground floor and exposed floor.
