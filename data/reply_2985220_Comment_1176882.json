You need to use the OpenStudio export for that. There are 10 template systems that you can select from them. All the components are under tab number 10. Looks for Honeybee_OpenStudioHVACSystems. I'm not sure if we have an example file for that but I can put one together for you if that helps.\n\nQ4. This can be a bug. I will check the attached file and update this discussion.\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 27, 2014 at 9:19pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1176574", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1176882"}
