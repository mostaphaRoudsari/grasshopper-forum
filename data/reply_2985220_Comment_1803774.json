{"body": "\nHi Ernst,\n\n\n\nIf there is a way to display the images in the rhino window, you could use the Human text to screen components to tag it, then use the ladybug image capture component to take a new image of the screen with the text overlaid. I haven't tried the image display in rhino,\u00a0but I often use the last two components to generate graphics.\n\n\n\n-Leland\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "August 25, 2017 at 3:14pm", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "topic_1803849", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1803774"}
