{"body": "\nHello again Abraham,\n\nthank you for the suggestion it looks very useful. More than Pollination itself (like also you say) that is just a visualization and result reading tool, nevertheless very interesting but not the solution to simplify a process like the one I presented, what would be very useful is the script by David Rutten, Permutations. Actually I knew about but I totally forgot. Is it already implemented into GH? I don't think so. So where I can download it? I could copy paste it from your definition, it is the Run all the iterations component but it is orange and the there is no icon so I am not sure it is a working one.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "April 24, 2015 at 04:53AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1271944", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1271945"}
