{"body": "Hardi,\nI see from your images the issue is more complex than we initially realized and you are probably going to have to build a custom workflow for this case. If I were modeling this situation, I would start by making a GH geometry mock-up of a single panel on one of the orientations. I would use a sun vector from the sunpath to simulate the tracking of the panels and hook up sliders to the sunpath inputs so that I could dynamically simulate the movement of the panels. Next, I would run a solar radiation study of the dynamic panel with other dynamic panels around it as context shading. From the difference between that result and the epw directNormalRadiation, I would calculate a shading factor. I would then animate the sliders to build up a list of 8760 shading factors (for each hour of the year). I am pretty sure that Djordje's components can take these shading factors as an input so that you can get values of harvested electricity for each hour. Then you do the same for each of the 4 orientations.\n\nI hope that helps.\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 08, 2017 at 04:56PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810775", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810928"}
