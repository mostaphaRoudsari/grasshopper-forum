{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and group members,\n\n\n\nI have made a parametric model of a huge space like a train station's waiting room. The model is used for annual energy simulation of the space and the total solar radiation of the roof.\n\n\n\nThe solar radiation is OK, but the EP simulation failed.\n\n\n\nIs there something wrong with the model setting? Or because of the curved form? If so, what should I do to handle that?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1629536", "name": "Capture.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1629537", "name": "Case-Tju.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "October 31, 2016 at 4:52am", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "topic": "Problems about modelling a huge space with Honeybee Energy Simulation", "id": "topic_1629538"}
