{"body": "\nHi! I am trying to use the colors performed by the solar analysis to create new mesh verticies. I think using the contourMesh component would be successful, I am just unsure what to attach to derrive these countour lines. I have also tried to go the route of Deconstruct Mesh by its colors using the gradient tool. I didn't have much luck with that, but that would also be a possibility. My last resort is to bake the colored mesh geometry and apply points manually, but I don't think the results would be as accurate. ANY HELP AT ALL would be so greatly appreciated! I'm a newbie. Thank you!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1733685", "name": "analysis geometry.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1733686", "name": "Parametric facade_solar analysis.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1733687", "name": "Ladybug analysis.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Alaina Needs Help", "created_at": "April 15, 2017 at 7:31pm", "created_by": "AlainaNeedsHelp", "topic": "contourMesh component/ creating new mesh verticies following solar analysis", "id": "topic_1733688"}
