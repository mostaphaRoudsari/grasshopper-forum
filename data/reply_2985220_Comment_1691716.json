{"body": "\nDevang, anton and i were working on this together (he submitted this for me). the issue is that when the base plane is a mesh or surface plane the analysis does not work. as soon as i feed a closed brep into the analysis (same exact location and grid size) the analysis works.\n\n\n\nI continue to run into this. I am also noticing that this analysis struggles with multiple breps.\n\n\n\nI might add that in this file i can get the example geometry to run just fine as well\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeremy Luebker", "created_at": "February 14, 2017 at 4:26pm", "created_by": "JeremyLuebker", "parent_id": "topic_1683817", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1691716"}
