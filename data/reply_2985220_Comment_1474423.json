{"body": "\nhey this is quite interesting, great work! as a lighting designer and heavy grasshopper user, this has been a long time coming. \u00a0first, we got a few issues when testing the example files:\n\n1) missing the embryoA image viewer - using firefly's image viewer in the mean time but can you share that?\n\n2) we ran into a snag when loading ies file from a network location - it only worked on local disk. you should include that in your documentation? is it possible to make the links work over network?\u00a0\n\n3) support for all ies file types?\n\n\u00a0\n\nsecond, some initial thoughts:\n\n1) change some of the nomenclature in the various components to not refer to 'Run daylight simulation' but just 'radiance lighting simulation.'\n\n2) would be very helpful to have an output stating lumens (yes it's in luminaire details) but have the read-out show resulting lumens after LLF + calndelaMultiplier would be great.\n\n3) possible incorporation of accelerad for GPU calc?\n\n4) for the ies photometric web view, it would be nice to show the point grid of all the candela readings - this would show me if the ies file was created with a few real readings in an integrating sphere, or output from a digital software like photopia (generally useful when doing fixture research). it'd also be cool to be able to turn on the vector or point of peak candela.\n\n5)in the 'Run Daylight Simulation' component - it'd be cleaner to separate out the inputs for\u00a0geometry\u00a0from the inputs\u00a0for lights.\n\n\n\nwill submit more comments as i try it out on a few real projects...\n\ncheers\n\ndan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Weissman", "created_at": "February 29, 2016 at 3:31pm", "created_by": "DanWeissman", "parent_id": "topic_1438108", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1474423"}
