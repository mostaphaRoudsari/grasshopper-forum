{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nIt took me a few re-readings of your question but I think that I have finally understood it and know the answer.\n\nYou can always get a glimpse into how the view component works by drawing lines in between the output testPts and the input points into the _viewTypeOrPts like so:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8q4PeepMCcidKP*Q6BcrIXWya9qOjQL66At-PYeMdJvqI*dVwgts9yV8blUo3-NzH9*kJZJLbxVBBU8aUidd5cj736rWzSIV/ViewAnalysis.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/8q4PeepMCcidKP*Q6BcrIXWya9qOjQL66At-PYeMdJvqI*dVwgts9yV8blUo3-NzH9*kJZJLbxVBBU8aUidd5cj736rWzSIV/ViewAnalysis.JPG)\n\nWhen you do this, you will see that the lines from the mesh faces you identify do not actually intersect any geometry, although this is largely because the _distFromBase is moving the points far enough away from the base surface so that the line clears any intersecting geometry. So, if you set the\u00a0_distFromBase to be smaller in your file, you will see that those surfaces you have there get occluded.\n\nAlso, for this specific case of view to the sun, I would sooner recommend that someone use the \"Ladybug_Sunlight Hours\" component for a shadow study rather than setting the sunPath scale to be very large:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;amp...;](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Shadow_Range_analysis&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\nSunlight hours will use the actual vector for intersections (instead of a line) and you therefore don't have to worry about how far away the sun position is.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1801764", "name": "GSC_00_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 21, 2017 at 8:14pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1801420", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1801761"}
