{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI need to use a grid of sensor points with a particular tree structure. I created then a mesh based on these points and used it as input in Honeybee. I would like then to unflatten the Honeybee output results using the original points as a guide. However the testPts output does not correspond to the mesh vertices but rather to the center of the mesh faces. Is there a way to use the vertices of the input mesh as sensor points?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nGiuseppe\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe Peronato", "created_at": "April 9, 2015 at 1:32am", "created_by": "GiuseppePeronato", "topic": "Custom sensor points", "id": "topic_1259513"}
