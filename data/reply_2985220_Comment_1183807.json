{"body": "\nHi Will,\n\nI think I made you confused about materials and constructions in HB. Let me try again: It is totally fine to apply the same material name to different breps in different components as far as they are referring to an identical material. What is problematic is to create different materials with the same name. They will be overwritten by the last one. Honeybee keeps track of materials using their names so you can't have two different materials/constructions with the same name.\n\n~5-10% of difference between the results in Radiance is just normal. Specially if you haven't set the parameters high enough. How much of difference you are getting? I suggest you to check this presentation. It will clarify how Radiance works:\u00a0[http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca...](http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day1/JM_AmbientCalculation.pdf)\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 8, 2014 at 8:14pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183340", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183807"}
