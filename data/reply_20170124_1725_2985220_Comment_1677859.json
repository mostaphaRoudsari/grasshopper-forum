{"body": "\nHi,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have the same issue. Where you ever able to figure it out?\u00a0\n\nI think mine is in part due to the fact that I have my Rhino on a separate E drive and all my Grasshopper components on a C drive.\n\nAll my other plugins work though, so I don't know if this is the problem.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\nMosh\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mosh Porter", "created_at": "January 24, 2017 at 05:25PM", "created_by": "MoshPorter", "parent_id": "topic_1601563", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1677859"}
