{"body": "\nWhat is the end goal here? The way rays will behave after hitting an object is essentially a function of surface properties of the materials and the spectral composition of the source radiation. As Mostapha mentioned, Ladybug raytracing is based on geometric calculations.\n\nSo, any raytracing results that you are achieving are likely to only be compatible with a very small subset of materials that we find in Construction. Lambertian surfaces, that are far more common in real world, tend to scatter light diffusely instead of casting sharp rays.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "April 21, 2017 at 10:55AM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1736785", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1737234"}
