{"body": "\nThanks Chris,\n\nAs soon as i saw the lines i get the issue was with the _distFromSurface. Live and learn.\n\nAs for the LB_SunlightHours i'm not sure i get your suggestion. The view analysis and the sunlightHours give different outputs for my needs. I want to calculate the amount of area that is in light/shade, as we have here standard requirements for that. Is clear that for the shadow study the sunLight is the one to use.\n\nThanks again,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 21, 2017 at 9:17pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1801761", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1801644"}
