{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThere is in effect a solveAdjacency on the way. So now this is probably a misunderstanding on my side about how things are supposed to be working.\n\nAttached the case i'm working on (sorry for the size and mess). But just see the 3 red arrows.\n\nThe first on the left shows how i define for a specific zone the adiabatic conditions. The middle one show that it is correctly defined when i defined the stand aone zone. The third on the right show what happens after the solve adjacency applied. What was before adiabatic is now outdoors (look for the surface z2a3_w2 for instance).\n\nAttached also the rhino file. The geometry is not internalised.\n\nWhat i am supposed to do if i want to keep the surface as adiabatic?\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1463188", "name": "munot o 09.02.16_AY.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1463189", "name": "sim 1 - munot o 09.02.16_AY-03.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 09:18PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463174", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463187"}
