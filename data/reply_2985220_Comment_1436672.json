{"body": "\nHi Christian,\n\n\n\nThe script works fine on my machine. Maybe you want to use Clean Tree component to make sure there in no null value in surface input.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5UirxQfJfB2eoNuoTYtjVJylPSvJAKVK-Ar-8EWwnQoiqvLOwHXa-CtXGCuzu2DvtdH4D9-tvcaUC4EpZ0JmfruVWlpVgjpg/shadingSurfaces.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5UirxQfJfB2eoNuoTYtjVJylPSvJAKVK-Ar-8EWwnQoiqvLOwHXa-CtXGCuzu2DvtdH4D9-tvcaUC4EpZ0JmfruVWlpVgjpg/shadingSurfaces.png)\n\n\n\nAlso I suggest to use the newer EPContext surface.
