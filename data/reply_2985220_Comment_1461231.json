{"body": "\nHi Iason,\n\nI'm not sure if I fully understand the relation between the first question and this comment. Back to EnergySimulationPar I just did a quick test and it works as expected. You can change both the terrain and timestep and they will change inside the .idf file.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/mQqoeU*Xt2bZqhWrJh-1w*sPERX4CpXGbz3ERD0UhEKEGYkR7DVJpSnsiVSpeBN*Xk7OgkSbdDKqgnKI17yfxdbOQGxDJ1iU/changeSimulationParameters.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/mQqoeU*Xt2bZqhWrJh-1w*sPERX4CpXGbz3ERD0UhEKEGYkR7DVJpSnsiVSpeBN*Xk7OgkSbdDKqgnKI17yfxdbOQGxDJ1iU/changeSimulationParameters.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to the original post can you help me to understand what is the exact EnergyPlus object that you're trying to change? Do you have a reference idf file? You should probably be able to set it up using\u00a0additionalStrings_\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 11, 2016 at 4:17pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1460233", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1461231"}
