{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and team HB.\u00a0\n\nI'm trying to load materials and specs included in the EP DataSets folder (C:\\EnergyPlus\\DataSets\\***plenty files here***) as the materials there included are not within the default OpenStudioLib file.\n\nI cant use the import idf component because it discards materials, any suggestions?\u00a0\n\nOn the same note, the EPWindowMaterials loaded by default, using the callfromEPContructionLibrary, are weird. Most of them are Fixed windows and theoretical glass. One of them has a U-Value of 700, which I suppose could refer to a 1.3mm glass pane.\n\nAren't the EP materials from Data Sets supposed to be included in the default lib? perhaps I've inadvertently done something to break the import function.\n\n\n\nkind regards,\u00a0\n\n\n\nMauricio\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mauricio Aguilar Cardenas", "created_at": "February 1, 2016 at 8:05am", "created_by": "MauricioAguilarCardenas135", "topic": "materials from EP DataSets", "id": "topic_1452015"}
