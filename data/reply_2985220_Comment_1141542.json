{"body": "\nHi Ben and Chris,\n\n\n\nBen - The warning is because of the order of execution of components in Grasshopper. If you disable/enable the components with warning they will work fine. To avoid the issue next time that you open the file select Honeybee_Honeybee component and press ctrl+B so it will be executed before other components next time you open the file.\n\n\n\nAlso can you try the attached file and let me know if it runs normal. There is a version check that tries to download a file from dropbox and I wonder if that is causing the issue.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1141543", "name": "Ladybug_withNoVersionCheck.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 2, 2014 at 4:35am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1141364", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1141542"}
