{"body": "\nHi Guys,\n\nIs there any one of you know how to do evaporate cooling simulation in Honeybee and Laybug?**<br/>**\n\nI was trying to use Roof Pond Strategy to cool down my Design in Kuala Lumpur during daytime. And so far, my method is modeling an\u00a0adjacent zone with natual ventilation and fan ventilation on top of my roof, and pretend this zone is acting like a roof pond. This method is pretty questionable.\n\nThus, I was wondering if any of you guys would have solid idea than mine.\n\n\n\nFYI, I found this\u00a0[1ZoneEvapCooler.idf](https://github.com/joshwentz/virtualpulse/blob/master/EnergyPlus-7-1-0/Examples/1ZoneEvapCooler.idf)\u00a0in GitHub, but also found it is hard to do it with honeybee and grasshopper.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Danielron", "created_at": "December 7, 2015 at 10:10pm", "created_by": "Danielron", "topic": "How to use Honeybee and Ladybug to model Evaporate Cooling", "id": "topic_1417038"}
