{"body": "\nHi Mehdi,\n\nI remember this problem happening to me a while a go but I did not have time to look into it or post on it. \u00a0I also had some complicated site geometry and the grid size was also small. \u00a0Now that I have seen this happen in two cases, it definitely smells like a bug to me.\n\nCould you post the GH file with the exact grid size and specifications that are causing this to fail?\n\nAs Mostapha wrote the radiation components, I feel that we should let him take a look at it first and, if he ends up being too busy after the next few days, I will look into fixing it.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 6, 2015 at 8:58pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1257478", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1257911"}
