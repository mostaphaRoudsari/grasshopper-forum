{"body": "\nAlso, another tip that I recently learned:\n\nYou can send any component to the back of the grasshopper canvass by selecting them in hitting Cntrl + B on the keyboard. \u00a0If you do this for your Honeybee_Honeybee and Ladybug_Ladybug components, this will ensure that they load first next time that you open your grasshopper file. \u00a0This then ensures that all of your other components work in the file instead of telling you that you should let ladybug and honeybee fly.\n\n\n\nAlso, if you do get the messages above, you can always right-click on the empty grasshopper canvass and hit \"Recompute\" to have the whole set of components on your canvass recompute.\n\n\n\nI hope that this helps.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 2, 2014 at 10:56am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1124213", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1125027"}
