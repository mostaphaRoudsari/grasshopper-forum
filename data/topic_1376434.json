{"body": "\nHi,\n\nAs for this [thread](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/radiation-results-lb-hb) i open here a new discussion for issue number 2 there.\n\n\n\nI want to get the yearly total radiation obtained in selected geometry.\n\n\n\nIn the attached, right side at the bottom. I get the calculation results, but after connecting them to the HB_readAllTheDSHourlyResults it takes ages to calculate and at the end rhino crashes. Can be that this is a memory problem? Or there is a way to make this work (total annual radiation for GridBased simulation)? For now i disabled the component, but i just wonder ...\n\nWords of wisdom for both issues will be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1376433", "name": "05_SunlightHourAnalysis_CrossTower-V0_Honeybee_Done_01.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 9, 2015 at 12:13pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "HB - Can't get radiation annual grid based calculations plotted.", "id": "topic_1376434"}
