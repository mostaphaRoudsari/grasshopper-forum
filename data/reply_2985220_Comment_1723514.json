{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,<br/> <br/> I'll try to explain what I'm trying to do clearly (it's for a studying project for my school).<br/> <br/> The PMV defined in Honeybee is calculated from the steady state. My project is involving to calculate the comfort at the transient state (building with travellers), so I have coded a new PMV in Python and I want to visualize the comfort thanks to the Honeybee_Visualize_Microclimate_Map component.<br/> <br/> The problem here is when I create a new matrix by modifying radTempMtx the component can't read it (see above IronPython.Runtime.List). When Abraham showed me the component that transform a csv file into a Matrix, I thought to convert my modified Matrix (in the example radTempMtx*2) into a csv file and to convert this csv file into a matrix that the Honeybee component can read.<br/> <br/> Is it possible to do that and is there a better way to visualize the comfort without the csv method ?<br/> <br/> Thank you for your answers.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mehdi HAMDANI", "created_at": "March 29, 2017 at 8:40am", "created_by": "MehdiHAMDANI", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1722920", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1723514"}
