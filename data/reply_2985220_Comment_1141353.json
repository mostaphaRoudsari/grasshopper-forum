{"body": "\nAbraham and Kostas,\n\n\n\nThank you for all of the questions. \u00a0I wrote that description to the shading mask before I really understood what the function inside the component was doing. \u00a0I have just replaced it with the following:\n\n\n\n\"An integer that is greater than or equal to 0, which to sets the number of times that the Tergenza sky patches are split. \u00a0Set to 0 to view a sky mask with the typical Tregenza sky, which will divide up the sky with a coarse density of 145 sky patches. \u00a0Set to 1 to view a sky mask of a Reinhart sky, which will divide up each of these Tergenza patches into 4 patches to make a sky with a total of 580 sky patches. Higher numbers input here will ensure a greater accuracy but will also take longer. The default is set to 3 to give you a high accuracy.\"\n\n\n\nTo answer the question of what the number is supposed to be, it is really whatever level of accuracy that you need the results to be. \u00a0You can put it as high of a number as you like until your system crashes :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 1, 2014 at 9:16pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1141158", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1141353"}
