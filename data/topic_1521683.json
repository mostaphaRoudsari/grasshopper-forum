{"body": "\nA once simple SolarAdjustedMRT to UTCI calculation has exploded into a multifaceted and high resolution study. Due to the high density of points in my analysis mesh, the SolarAdjustedMRT calculation takes considerable time. I am finding that an annual analysis will take approximately 1min per grid point with useOldRes active for genCumulativeSkyMtx and Parellel activated on the SolarAdjustedMRT component. For a practical resolution in an outdoor setting, I am finding that analysis runs are taking me 2-3 hours.\n\nDue to the long run-time, I am attempting to develop a workflow that allows me to re-import the SolarAdjustedMRT output into the model for quick and repeated study after the initial analysis. Please find the GH script attached for a stripped down version of what I have been working with. You will find the EPW import connecting to the UTCI calculator for all metrics except MRT. This is where I used the output of SolarAdjustedMRT. I streamed the contents from the SolarAdjustedMRT to both CSV and TXT and attempted to re-import them with a Read File component. \u00a0\n\nWhen the imported file is brought into the UTCI component, I get the error \"calculation terminated by the user\". Looking at the script this seems to be a runtime error and reading past forums, this occurs when users hit the Escape key during the calculation. After ensuring that I was not subconsciously hitting escape every time I tried this method, I cannot determine what the error might be.\u00a0\n\nThe GH script is attached if you care to recreate this issue. I can send the TXT and CSV files that I am using per request. They are too large to attach here.\u00a0\n\nPlease let me know if you have encountered this issue and developed any work around techniques. The UTCI calculation is extremely informative but the long run time associated with grid resolutions usable by designers make its counterproductive at times.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/teNLbyfAUPLyy9c3gWO83E8q85CmCGnljYBauXh9q-uZuID5TC8YAcI0k-U787N9RqOt18f*xxYSzxRJEWNpMXO07FEn4mBY/UTCICalcError.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/teNLbyfAUPLyy9c3gWO83E8q85CmCGnljYBauXh9q-uZuID5TC8YAcI0k-U787N9RqOt18f*xxYSzxRJEWNpMXO07FEn4mBY/UTCICalcError.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1521682", "name": "UTCI-outdoor comfort_160503-clean.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Kit Elsworth", "created_at": "May 3, 2016 at 12:56pm", "created_by": "KitElsworth", "topic": "Existing MRT + UTCI Calculation Error", "id": "topic_1521683"}
