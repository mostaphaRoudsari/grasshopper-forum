{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nSome changes in the results but still big differences.\n\nTwo inputs differ from yours: i set the maxOutdoor (28C becouse i want to ensure the wind themperature doesn't rise the body temperature), and the stackDischargeCoeff_ to 0.25 (no insect screen).\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7AULtQmLSn0k29rM5AieV6B1ij6piX0zXUFCPX5UeVCjdNYVYEo96koKekmHICisQyBVczwBr0UNT5gPtNUbrT63*NNCGtdV/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/7AULtQmLSn0k29rM5AieV6B1ij6piX0zXUFCPX5UeVCjdNYVYEo96koKekmHICisQyBVczwBr0UNT5gPtNUbrT63*NNCGtdV/Capture.JPG)Checking the IDF files i don't see much differences (attached). But the block ZoneMixing in the E+ has 14 objects and the OS has 7 (the number of zones is 7, so i don't know why the E+ doubled the objects). Also their values are different (DesignFlowRate). I think there is an issue here ...\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1619614", "name": "EPlus.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1619615", "name": "OS.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 16, 2016 at 12:48PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619390", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619613"}
