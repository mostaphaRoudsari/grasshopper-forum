{"body": "\nDear Mostapha and dear everyone!\n\nWe found some problems with LB and HB which look like bugs.\n\nSome are easy to fix and show up very often.\n\nTo fix them we have to disable and reactivate or even replaced various items and let the HB and LB fly again and again.\n\nWith growing complexity of the Grasshopper canvas some unpredictable behaviors of LBHB are increasing.\n\nThe result of an annual cumulative irradiation study is not always consistent when performed with LBHB but is credible when performed with Diva on the very same Grasshopper file.\n\nTo trigger the bug just change the value of one of the inputs without set the HB toggle to \"False\" but leaving it on \"True\"\n\nWe noticed that when the bug happens the simulation in radiance is really quick.If the toggle on the HB simulation is switched\u00a0 \"False\" and then switched \"True\" again the simulation produces meaningful results.\n\nWe can solve this problem by switching the toggle, but the number of unpredictable behaviors makes us uneasy.\n\nIs it for other users as well or is a problem specific of some computers?\n\nThere may be problems that we did not detect?\n\nThank you very much!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1345766", "name": "HB simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Jennifer Addams", "created_at": "August 19, 2015 at 09:32AM", "created_by": "JenniferAddams", "topic": "unpredictable behaviour of LBHB components", "id": "topic_1345767"}
