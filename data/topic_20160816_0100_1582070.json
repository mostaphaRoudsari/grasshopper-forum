{"body": "\nHi everybody\n\nI\u00a0have a question. If somebody\u00a0can explain it to me. In fact,\u00a0I ran a simple analysis 3 times and I got a little\u00a0different\u00a0values\u00a0for illumination. so if I want to compare different cases with each other I should run all of them at once? and after how many runs does it approach to real values?\n\n\n\nthanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Farzane Oghazian", "created_at": "August 16, 2016 at 01:00AM", "created_by": "farzaneo", "topic": "Question about analyzing results", "id": "topic_1582070"}
