{"body": "\n\n\nI found the answer here, in case somebody is interested, basically Radiance does not take into account the azimuth, therefore you see an angle of 180 deg rather than 160 so the Waldram generated it is not correct.\n\nIt is still very useful \u00a0to have a general idea.\n\n[https://radiance-online.lbl.gov:447/pipermail/radiance-general/2014...](https://radiance-online.lbl.gov:447/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-December/010650.html)\n\nThanks Mostapha for your job this isgreat!\n\nPerhaps VSC can be calculated via a simple tracing component not radiance based?\n\nBye\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "amedeo scofone", "created_at": "February 17, 2015 at 5:37am", "created_by": "amedeoscofone", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1226214", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1226033"}
