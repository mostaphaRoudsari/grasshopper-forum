{"body": "\nChris,\u00a0\n\nI tried your suggestion of removing the folder that it created under C/Ladybug every time I run a simulation and it still does not work. Furthermore, I can see how the result files are updated for every simulation. The weird thing is every other parameter I change (infiltration, walls composition, occupancy, schedules...) works fine and does have an impact in the results. It is only the ventilation (both per occupant and per area) that doesn't work.\u00a0\n\nI have reinstalled the latest version of Ladybug and Honeybee and still nothing. I tried at a colleague's computer and we still experience the exact same problem. On the other hand it does work well in your computer. I cannot think of any more possible causes.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "November 12, 2014 at 3:16am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1166306", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1166829"}
