{"body": "\nHi Amedeo,\n\nI couldn't get the file to work as I wasn't sure what is the excel data to be imported. I definitely think it's quite useful to map comfort on top of values. How do you use this? Do you map the values on top of the wind-rose or do you calculate percentages?\n\nI'm going to re-write wind-rose component soon and I can include this feature in the component. What about mapping the values as an annualHourlyData?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 27, 2016 at 7:37am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1517444", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1517917"}
