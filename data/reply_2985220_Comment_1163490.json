{"body": "\nLeland,\n\nI am not so sure of the best method for integrating across many sub-hourly skies and this is probably a better question for Mostapha when he gets the chance. \u00a0I can think of some methods where you could animate a slider in GH to run several radiation studies, collect all of the data with a record component, and parse/total all of the data together in grasshopper to get a really high accuracy radiation study for whatever period you ran the slider for. \u00a0Is there a particular reason why you need such a high accuracy? \u00a0This seems far beyond the accuracy needed for most design decisions.\n\nHoneybee allows you to generate many different types of skies. \u00a0Here's an example comparing the cumulative sky, which is usually a Tregenza sky and a Climate-based sky.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/15pbGCBw7iMmu1Lg*y6cE-7fL27NPf9drK8uH7G5-EwVMJIrT2Urlxz8XbtqoqfxtcwjVQ7T6Trtw4Vk0RFC5sQWlDRu1YuH/SkyTypes.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/15pbGCBw7iMmu1Lg*y6cE-7fL27NPf9drK8uH7G5-EwVMJIrT2Urlxz8XbtqoqfxtcwjVQ7T6Trtw4Vk0RFC5sQWlDRu1YuH/SkyTypes.png)\n\nAs you see, the climate-based sky is really smooth and accurate but it only for a specific time of day. \u00a0For cumulative radiation methods, the sky is divided into patches. \u00a0There are also several types of CIE skies (sunny, cloudy, isotropic, etc.). \u00a0I think Mostapha put together a whole example file on the different sky types and I would look at that.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 6, 2014 at 7:21pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163283", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163490"}
