{"body": "\nM, Here we go. I stripped out a bunch of context to lean up the model.\n\nI sent you my LB solution so you can see how\u00a0I wired for floors.\n\nThere is an ON/OFF switch at the left to turn on the solution.\n\nThere is an underlying mass model from which i use GH to slice floors. I solve for one floor and use the remainder as context.\n\nI added a rudimentary skin composed of spandrel (solid), sunshades (solid), and glazing. I just made these quickly and haven't adopted the geometry into the GH solution.\n\n\n\nThanks pal!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1375642", "name": "Sunshading Analysis For Mostapha.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1375643", "name": "FRA_Paris.Orly.071490_IWEC.epw"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1375644", "name": "Sunshading Attempt with Mostaphas template - Radiation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Robert Narracci", "created_at": "October 8, 2015 at 12:42pm", "created_by": "RobertNarracci", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1375629", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1375641"}
