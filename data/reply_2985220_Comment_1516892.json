{"body": "\nHi Amedeo,\n\n\n\nThat would be very interesting definition. It would be nice if you wanna share. It would be very helpful for single point pedestrian wind comfort assessment.\n\n\n\nHowever, for assessment of even the smallest grid the files produced by the current workflow we are testing will be way too large for GH lists. I think python coding will be needed. That said, that code is quite simple and doable (if I knew how). At the moment, my solution is working in R, which handles big data quite well. I will share my R code/process here in the morning (again a very simple code), in case it helps this.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 26, 2016 at 10:00am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1516886", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1516892"}
