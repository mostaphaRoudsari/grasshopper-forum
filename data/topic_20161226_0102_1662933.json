{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\n\n\nI am fairly new to Grasshopper/ Honeybee. I am watching the video tutorials on Honeybee by Chris Mackey and practicing as I watch. I am using the example model that was attached with the tutorial and literally following him step by step. I expected this to be a fool-proof approach however I am getting a couple of errors. :|\u00a0\n\nFor the Honeybee LabelZones and LabelSurfaces function I get an error that reads \"1. Solution exception:name 'w' is not defined\"\n\nI get these errors even before I feed it with any input.\n\n\n\nFor the Solve Adjacencies\u00a0function I get the following error:\n\n\"1. Solution exception:8a45414b-f103-4c86-ab86-ed02392fb497\"\n\n\n\nI did a quick search of the forum and did not find a thread with similar questions. Apologies if I have missed it.\n\n\n\nI am using version 0.0.59 of Ladybug and version 0.0.60 of Honeybee. I have attached my GH file for reference. There must be something fundamentally wrong with what I am doing (and hopefully a simple fix). Any help will be much appreciated!\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\nSindhu\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1662932", "name": "1 - Mackey Residence Geometry-Trial.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Sindhu Murali", "created_at": "December 26, 2016 at 01:02AM", "created_by": "SindhuMurali", "topic": "Honeybee Errors- LabelZones | LabelSurfaces | Solve Adjacencies", "id": "topic_1662933"}
