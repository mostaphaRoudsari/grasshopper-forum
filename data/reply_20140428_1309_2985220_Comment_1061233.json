{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI have changed your component\u00a0a little. Reading the batch file with the notepad the string was something like\n\nies2rad -o mylight iesfile.ies -m 0.765\n\nand it didn't work. Now it is\n\nies2rad -o mylight\u00a0-m 0.765\u00a0iesfile.ies\n\nbelow you fine the new version. I'm new to the python language, I hope I did it fine.\n\nClaudio\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1061234", "name": "IES2HB_WIP_IV.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "April 28, 2014 at 01:09PM", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1060779", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1061233"}
