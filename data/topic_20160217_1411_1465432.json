{"body": "\nHey Guys,\u00a0\n\nI seem to be having a peculiar problem with Lady bug. I'm trying to get sunlight hours for a list of geometries but the result seems to be incorrect. It would seem that I would see more solar hours on the south side but every time I run the simulation the result shows the south side to have the least number of sun light hours. I have attached the .gh file below along with the epw file. You might have to load the epw twice. Would really appreciate the help.\u00a0\n\nThank you!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1465430", "name": "facade study.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1465431", "name": "USA_CA_Los.Angeles.722950_TMY2.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Perry White", "created_at": "February 17, 2016 at 02:11PM", "created_by": "PerryWhite", "topic": "Lady Bug sunlight hours result not accurate", "id": "topic_1465432"}
