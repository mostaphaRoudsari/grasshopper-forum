{"body": "\nHi Atta,\n\n\n\nThe simulation works fine on my machine, I do get the same error an explanation of the error can be seen here:\u00a0[https://unmethours.com/question/4372/severe-error-with-non-convex-s...](https://unmethours.com/question/4372/severe-error-with-non-convex-surfaces/)\n\n\n\nThis is not really a severe error but by making all your surfaces convex it may change the results. I couldn't see any non-convex surfaces in your model, but if you can find them and convert them to convex surfaces the error will go away.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "July 21, 2016 at 12:18pm", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "topic_1569017", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1569639"}
