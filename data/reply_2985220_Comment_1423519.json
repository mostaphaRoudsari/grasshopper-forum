{"body": "\nOK Claudia. I think we are almost there.\n\nThe problem, for what i checked is related to the tolerance of the Rhino file.\n\nI set it to 0.1 (see attached) and almost all of the windows are now imported correctly into GH.\n\nThere are 3 windows at the north facade that i don't succeed, but i suggest you to straighten the walls there to get them also. Those walls are very small and i don't believe they will affect the results if you make the wall straight.\n\nI also changed there some normal directions of windows, just for consistency.\n\nThe GH remained almost unchanged, but i did add some previews for the HB_Zones and changed the order of the components for the insertion of the windows into the zones.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1423520", "name": "Floor_AY.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1423521", "name": "Floor_AY.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 18, 2015 at 9:09am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1423381", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1423519"}
