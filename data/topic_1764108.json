{"body": "\nHi. I have used Ladybug tools for 1.5 years.It is an amazing software for environmental analysis in Grasshopper and Rhino platform. As I know,Honeybee can calculate the horizontal and vertical lighting illuminance.\n\n\n\nRecently I am involved in the office building project. The client asked our team to \u00a0calculate the cylindrical illuminance. So I came here and started this discussion.\n\n\n\nIs there any method or some component in Honeybee can be used for calculating the cylindrical illuminance ?\n\nI uploaded the relevant file to the attachment. Please look at it!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1764106", "name": "Cylindrical illuminance.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1764107", "name": "In-field measurement of cylindrical illuminance and the impact of room surface reflectances on the visual environment.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Minggang Yin", "created_at": "June 6, 2017 at 1:31am", "created_by": "minggangyin", "topic": "How to calculate the cylindrical illuminance in the room?", "id": "topic_1764108"}
