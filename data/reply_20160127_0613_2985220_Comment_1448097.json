{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nSomehow I completely skipped this! What a shame it's simply amazing. Will play around with it asap.\n\n\n\nI'm using pollination with a lot of success lately to test a series of parametric study definitions. While I do realize that the instructions on the wiki seem straightforward, would there be a chance for a sample file for DE?\n\n\n\nAs a side note, not sure if it's worthy of a separate discussion, but I did run into some trouble with parametric daylighting (DF in particular). It seems to be very slow restarting the simulation and taking up a lot of memory. I'm fairly certain it has to do with my definition, as most of the HB objects are \"re-made\" in the pipeline at each iteration. Has anyone ever had memory trouble with parametric daylighting?\n\n\n\nAlso, I'm curious. Would rotating a simple brep before making zones out of it be better, computationally-wise, than rotating HB objects?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance and thanks for the amazing job!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 27, 2016 at 06:13AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1418128", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1448097"}
