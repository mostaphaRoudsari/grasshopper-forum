{"body": "\nI'm currently working on a model where we're looking at the use of natural ventilation.\n\n\n\nI'm getting\u00a0simultaneous heating and vent happening, which is driving heating demand up. I've played with the set point parameters and have concluded that I'm \u00a0doing something wrong on the set points...\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe heating is set to 18C, the natural vent controls are as per the image in the PDF attached.\n\n\n\nThe second image in the PDF is form the ESO file, where we can see the internal temp rising and then the heating kicking in...as the windows open in winter (this is for Canberra, Australia, hence the June date).\n\n\n\nI've played with the lower limit on natural vent, but this doesn't\u00a0resolve the issue.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny pointers, much appreciated.\n\n\n\nErik\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1744329", "name": "Document1.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "erik moore", "created_at": "May 2, 2017 at 5:09am", "created_by": "erikmoore307", "topic": "Natural Ventilation Simultaneous Vent and Heating", "id": "topic_1744330"}
