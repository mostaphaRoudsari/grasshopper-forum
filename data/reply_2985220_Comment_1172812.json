{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI have the same problem too and I am using VER 0.0.58. in the\u00a0genSkyMtx_Fixed file.\u00a0The following steps are what I did:\n\n1. Update Radiance: installed radiance-4.3.a\n\n2. Download the\u00a0gendaymtx (21kb) and copy it to\u00a0c:\\ladybug and\u00a0c:\\radiance\\bin\n\n3. Update cumulative SkyMtx component in Grasshopper\n\nHowever, I still have the same problem, could you check which steps I missed or did wrong? Thank you.\n\n\n\nHui Ling\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1172814", "name": "problem.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1172815", "name": "gendaymtx update_radiance_bin.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "HUI-LING CHANG", "created_at": "November 20, 2014 at 2:09pm", "created_by": "HUILINGCHANG", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1160319", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1172812"}
