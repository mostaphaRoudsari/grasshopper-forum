{"body": "\nHi Mike,\n\nThat error has nothing to do with the EPW file and everything to do with how you updated the components. \u00a0If you updateAllUserObjs, you will see that the new sunpath component has an input called solarOrStandardTime_. \u00a0When you use the updateThisFile option, it only replaces code inside the sunpath component and not the inputs or outputs in the Grasshopper UI. \u00a0Hence the error. \u00a0Drag/drop a new sunpath component onto the canvas and all will work.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 14, 2017 at 5:29pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1712567", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1712376"}
