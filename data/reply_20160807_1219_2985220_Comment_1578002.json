{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\n\n\nI just removed the floor normalizing input of the result reader yesterday as I realized that there was a lot of difficulty with doing floor normalization with OpenStudio HVAC results (ie. do you normalize by the floor area of each zone or by the floor area of the whole building. \u00a0It depends on whether the HVAC component is zone-based or a part of a central system, etc.).\n\n\n\nYou will see that I added a component that computes both of these floor normalized values (zone-by-zone and building-wide) for you:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fboPS79zVdEagtYswkOUhELTgqfhd3lWsLUcSRXR5gdBB0igp8k2lKvS8lDsvvG4Cif6OYDHzQRXrSmXt4ARDmWCVIVWU3vg/NewFlorNormCompJPG.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fboPS79zVdEagtYswkOUhELTgqfhd3lWsLUcSRXR5gdBB0igp8k2lKvS8lDsvvG4Cif6OYDHzQRXrSmXt4ARDmWCVIVWU3vg/NewFlorNormCompJPG.JPG)\n\n\n\nAlso, take notice of the normalizeByFloorArea input on the \"Color Zones By EP Result\" component:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fboPS79zVdFvRFrpDFF4ORbot5T2L8vprEK-TTdvWL8PXUR9wfnTVnnBmm6N9Eo5IDtyss2iVuZ1B5wZb8A4ZEaWwvV8OVpW/NromFlrInput.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fboPS79zVdFvRFrpDFF4ORbot5T2L8vprEK-TTdvWL8PXUR9wfnTVnnBmm6N9Eo5IDtyss2iVuZ1B5wZb8A4ZEaWwvV8OVpW/NromFlrInput.JPG)\n\n\n\nBy default, this is set to normalize the results by the floor area since you are usually much more interested in energy intensity than total energy. \u00a0Set this to \"False\" and you will see the zones colored with absolute energy values.\n\n\n\nSee attached for an example file.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1578004", "name": "vizzoneresult_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 07, 2016 at 12:19PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1578056", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578002"}
