{"body": "\nGlad you're finding it useful, Bernardo!\n\nAbraham, if this would put you a bit at ease, I did a quick 2-minute validation of those december conditions against the CBE's online SolarCal tool ([http://smap.cbe.berkeley.edu/comforttool](http://smap.cbe.berkeley.edu/comforttool)):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/E6-J*b1OZQMq6TDC1OkBWkR6uTXKKF4PlM-TMFujWKyiszGQ9y1dcK4CLBQFjImAt743OpbEraU9-UcTkEnTbhWLwzgW*0V3/ShortSolarCalValidation.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/E6-J*b1OZQMq6TDC1OkBWkR6uTXKKF4PlM-TMFujWKyiszGQ9y1dcK4CLBQFjImAt743OpbEraU9-UcTkEnTbhWLwzgW*0V3/ShortSolarCalValidation.PNG)\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the image, I got an MRT Delta of 40.2 C, which is pretty close to the ~42 C MRT Delta that we were getting over the whole mannequin in the outdoor conditions of noon on the NYC solstice. \u00a0I'm going to do a more in-depth validation of the tool for a conference paper this weekend and I'll post the link to the paper here once it gets past peer review in another few weeks. \u00a0For now, feel free to check your MRT values against the CBE Tool if you would like another source to ease your skepticism.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 14, 2014 at 6:38pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1166165", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1169031"}
