{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nThank you for your reply.\n\n\n\nI have actually let it go for now (needed a break) and doing Daylight simulations. Thankfully, there the flow allows to add different types of surfaces.\n\n\n\nAs for your comment I agree, I just thought that the upper part of the wall (the COM1) which is opaque would be enough. The results were indeed garbage, and in the surface analysis it looked as if there was wall (that is COM1) behind the glazing layers. That seemed strange. I will give it a go later with gaps on the edges.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 03, 2015 at 01:26AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1235266", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1235368"}
