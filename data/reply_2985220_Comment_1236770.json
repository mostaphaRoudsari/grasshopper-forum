{"body": "\nHi Serge and Mostapha,\n\n\n\n@Serge\n\n\n\nThanks for the link very helpful!\n\n\n\nHave a couple of questions for you if you don't mind.\n\n\n\nDoes Window 7.3 generate BDSF for more than one layer or will I just get the BDSF for the outer layer, my shading? Do I have to use blinds with spectral data?\n\n\n\nAlso, do you know of any way to get radiance to work with W7.3? I copied the radiance folder in the program, added the lines in the ini file but nothing. Is it a custom made radiance they want or the normal installation? Or is it that there is no batch file anywhere? I'm guessing this is stupid and has a simple solution.\n\n\n\n@Mostapha\n\n\n\nIs it possible to import EnergyPlus files generated by Window7.3?\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for the feedback!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 4, 2015 at 7:13pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1221519", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1236770"}
