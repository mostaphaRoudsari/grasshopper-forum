{"body": "\nHello everyone.\n\nI am dealing with a radiation analysis for a simple surface with a shading device.\n\nI have the intention to perform 100 000 simulations including different shading geometries.\n\nThanks to anemone, I create a program which is able the scroll through all possibilities and for each one , performs a radiation analysis simulation. Each simulation lasts 1 second.\u00a0\n\nThe problem is that as far as the iteration index is getting higher ,the simulation time consumption is getting greater ( from 1 second to 2 seconds).Also the rhino memory allowance, as well as analyse time consumption, is getting larger. Moreover, I find out that Lady bug radiation analysis component contributes mainly in this memory issue.\n\nI have tried to clear and recompute solution, but unfortunately rhino allowance memory stays as higher as before.\n\nI looked at Radiation analysis code, and it appears that no dispose() or garbage commands are applied.\n\nHas anyone ever been in such a situation before?\u00a0\n\nI have no clue how to deal with this issue. I will be very pleased with your contribution.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "MARFOUQ MOHAMED AMINE", "created_at": "September 11, 2017 at 11:02AM", "created_by": "MARFOUQMOHAMEDAMINE", "topic": "Radiation analysis memory problem", "id": "topic_1811874"}
