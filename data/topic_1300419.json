{"body": "\nHello Chris,\n\n\n\nI am trying to find out why I get those unrealistically high cooling loads for a building in NY. From what I can find online the usual cooling load in NY is around 6-10% of total thermal loads.\n\n\n\nMaybe something I do wrong when I assign materials, zones? or something with my setting points or natural ventilation ?\n\n\n\nThank you very much in advance,\n\n\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1300418", "name": "Honeybee_Cooling_Too_High.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "May 31, 2015 at 6:05pm", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Honeybee NY extremely high cooling loads", "id": "topic_1300419"}
