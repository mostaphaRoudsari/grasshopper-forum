{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI have a question about DGP. I want to assess the DGP at a certain point in my building caused by the facade across the street. What I have done is running the annual DGP simulation, then removing the building on the other side and then run it again. Then I subtracted both results to get the DGP produced by the building.\n\nI got a suggestion (copied below) at the Radiance mailing group about a more accurate way to identify the amount of glare produced by a specific object:\n\n**\"One option is to run the evalglare program with the -d and -c parameters.**<br/>**&gt;\u00a0evalglare -d -c check.hdr image.hdr**\n\n**This will do two things:**\n\n**(*1*) the -d option will give you a list of all contrast-based glare sources, including reflections from your facade;**\n\n**(*2*) the -c option will colour the separate contrast-based glare sources randomly in the check.hdr file. You can even plug the values from 1 into the contrast half of the DGP equation.\"**\n\nCan this be done with Honeybee?\n\nI was also advised to avoid simplified methods to calculate DGP:\n\n**\"And just to be sure - don't use any of the existing simplified methods\u00a0to calculate DGP (they are not based on a full rendering), because they are based on illuminance calculations using rtrace -I - in that case you will miss the specular reflection of the sun\"**\u00a0\n\nI am not sure if the annual glare simulation from \"Honeybee_Annual Daylight Simulation\" component uses one of these simplified methods. Maybe someone can clarify that.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nAlejandro\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "April 27, 2015 at 01:49AM", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "Identify glare from a specific glare source", "id": "topic_1273951"}
