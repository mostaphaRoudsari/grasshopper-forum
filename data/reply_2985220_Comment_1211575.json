{"body": "\nThis answers the question of weather or not I'm modifying the radiance settings, or manipulating data post run to achieve a spherical sensor. Sounds like I'm running two hemispherical simulations and figuring out how to combine the data.\n\nThat makes sense except for one thing. Why would you average them? When I run the simulation in the two different directions... I get a high value (looking up) and a very low value (looking down)... if I average them, that would indicate that the high value was not accurate to begin with.\n\nI would assume that I would add the values together, that is, if the sensors are really \"searching for light\" and just additively gathering light from its project rays. Is there some sort of sophisticated method of combining the 'found' light from the rays of a sensor that would effect how I would combine light coming from these two directions?\n\nI think ultimately this is where I got stuck. I didn't want to present anything as predicted light levels of the atrium in the analysis due to this ambiguous understanding of the methodolgy.\n\nI hope this makes sense. Thanks for you wonderful help and dedication to this plugin... it is very exciting for us architects.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "will krzymowski", "created_at": "January 26, 2015 at 12:01pm", "created_by": "willkrzymowski", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1210119", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1211575"}
