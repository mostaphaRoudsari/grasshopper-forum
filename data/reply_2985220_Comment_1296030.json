{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nThe answer is yes so long as you are requesting outputs from E+ in a CSV format (OutputControl:Table:Style,Comma;). \u00a0You can do this with Openstudio and with most other E+ interfaces as far as I know.\n\nAll that you have to do is make a GH panel with the file address of the CSV and plug it into the \"Read EP Result\" component. \u00a0If you request outputs that are non-standard in Honeybee, the data will be brought in through the \"otherZoneData\" or \"otherSurfaceData\" of the respective result-reading components.\n\nAlso important, make sure that the folder that contains the CSV result file also contains the .eio file output from E+. \u00a0This is necessary to build up the header information on the imported E+ data.\n\nIf this is not working for you, please upload and example GH file with the issue and we will make sure it is fixed.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 26, 2015 at 6:44pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1294039", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1296030"}
