{"body": "\nCool Chris, I'm really interested in checking out Boris' tool.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI agree, the iso solar tool is pretty exciting. Arguably it's the current state-of-the-art in terms of these 'solar voluming tools'. I started coding a version of it with Ladybug, but had to abandon it in favour of other projects (I think it's still floating around somewhere on my git account). That being said, I'd like to have version of it so if no one else tackles it in the Ladybug community, I'll see if I can do so, and post an update here.\n\n\n\n@Jacob\n\nReinforcing Chris' point about the sunlight hours studies, you might want to check out section 3.2 of this paper: [http://naturalfrequency.com/articles/solar-availability-cities](http://naturalfrequency.com/articles/solar-availability-cities)\u00a0. There's a couple of options there, but I think a grid of sunlight studies is one of the more effective methods of capturing the effect of context geometry.\n\n\n\n- S \u00a0\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "January 22, 2015 at 10:56pm", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209547", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209774"}
