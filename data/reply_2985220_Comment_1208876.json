{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI recently started using Ladybug as a student and it has been a great tool to influence design decisions. I really appreciate your time and effort put into developing this so thank you!\n\n\n\nI have an urban site modeled in Rhino and want to run some solar envelop and solar fan studies. \u00a0I am able to get the fan and envelope but they don't seem to be changing based on some of the adjacent buildings. \u00a0Is the sun path tool supposed to pick up on this geometry or does it need to be imported somewhere? \u00a0I'm guessing it has to be plugged in somewhere but not sure where or how to do this....\n\nIs there a gh file out there that has somewhere to import site geometry?\n\n\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nJacob V.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jacob VDR", "created_at": "January 21, 2015 at 5:42pm", "created_by": "2111f5opeco91", "parent_id": "topic_969681", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1208876"}
