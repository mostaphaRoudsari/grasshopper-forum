{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\nI have been watching the Chris Mackey\u00b4s videos \"HoneyBee Energy Modelling\" (thanks a lot!! they are sooo useful)\u00a0because I would like to start\u00a0runnig multi-zone simulations. But there is something that I don\u00b4t know/understand.. Is it possible to assign just to one surface an alternate boundary condition?\n\nI mean, through the \"Honeybee_Solve Adjacencies\" component i am able to assign different\u00a0BC between two zones, but in that case, maybe more than\u00a0a wall\u00a0will change its BC.\n\nWhat should I do to change the BC just to one wall?\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia \u00a0\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 21, 2016 at 07:30AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Multi-Zones Boundary Conditions", "id": "topic_1551861"}
