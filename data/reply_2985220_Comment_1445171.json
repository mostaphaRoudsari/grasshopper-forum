{"body": "\nHi Alessandro\n\n\n\nAs you say this can;t be done if it is a non-planar surface. However there is a bit of a crude workaround that might be good enough for you in this instance. If you make the curved surfaces planar and then project the glazing surfaces onto the non-planar surface you can use Honeybee_addHBGlz with these projected surfaces as the childsurfaces.\u00a0\n\nIt is certainly not the neatest solution but it will give you a broken up window if that is what you want to see.\n\n\n\n(apologies for the messy script - I was rushing)\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nDuncan\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1445173", "name": "GlazingRatioAlessandroDC.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "January 22, 2016 at 9:45am", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "parent_id": "topic_1445114", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1445171"}
