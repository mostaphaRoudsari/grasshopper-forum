{"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\n\n\nGreat thanks for your work and immediate reply, and so thankful for your patience to run my gh file completely. The result sounds excellent and exciting.\n\n\n\nSo, you mean my gh file runs well with no problem that I mentioned above. Hmm, interesting. Maybe I should change another device to run again.\n\n\n\nLast but not the least, I'll appreciate it if it's possible to\u00a0post a capture of result for me. If not, everything is fine, still give my best thanks to you.\u00a0\n\n\n\nXiaojian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "November 17, 2016 at 12:02am", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1641132", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1640989"}
