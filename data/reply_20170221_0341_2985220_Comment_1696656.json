I simply saved the bin file as epw file. [http://bigladdersoftware.com/projects/elements/](http://bigladdersoftware.com/projects/elements/)\n\n\n\nI tried to run the integrated daylight and energy simulation and I am getting runtime errors in the Hoenybee run daylight simulation and Honeybee run energy simulation. For energy simulation I am getting \"Solution exception:'ascii' codec can't encode character '\\uCE5C' in position 211\"\n\n\n\nCould this has to do with making sure the epw file is in the right format?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you again Mostapha.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1696658", "name": "Integrated_Daylight_and_Energy_simulation_yj.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1696659", "name": "GBS_06M12_11_048082.bin"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1696660", "name": "GBS_06M12_11_048082.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "February 21, 2017 at 03:41AM", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1695044", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1696656"}
