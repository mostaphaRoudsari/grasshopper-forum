{"body": "\n\"I did read about your post on butterfly. butterfly is cfd and coolvent is thermal zone as I understand.\"\n\nThat's true.\n\n\n\n\"After checking simulation CFD 2015, I realized that one big advantage for LB+HB is that well, I didnt see a built in feature of taking account for direct solar gain as part of the simulation.\"\n\nThis is actually part of the process in Butterfly. Here is the conceptual workflow:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/6aOMGtxdGe41cMcXSQTlkbVZJtFlv5Ln7A1cymhtzgmbeh5VtcFXP9Fodpq9QyZiAio1BVGxx9z8-iISoEkNQvNU2dW4Kt9e/butterfly_workflow.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/6aOMGtxdGe41cMcXSQTlkbVZJtFlv5Ln7A1cymhtzgmbeh5VtcFXP9Fodpq9QyZiAio1BVGxx9z8-iISoEkNQvNU2dW4Kt9e/butterfly_workflow.jpg)\n\n\n\nThere are technical issues involved though if you want to consider the effects of long-wave radiation from the surfaces which is something that EFRI-Pulse project is trying to address.\n\n\n\n\"p.s. I reread what I wrote and just wanted clearify I sure didn't refer to any of your work with honeybee or ladybug as \"artistic illustration.\" I meant my pretty arrows :)\"\n\n\n\nNo worries! I personally consider data visualization as one of the most important parts of the development and I'm a big fan of meaningful and beautiful graphs and arrows.\u00a0If you are looking for a great talk on visualizing algorithms then you should check this one:\u00a0[http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/),\u00a0[http://vimeo.com/112319901](http://vimeo.com/112319901)\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 23, 2014 at 10:57pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1188851", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1194213"}
