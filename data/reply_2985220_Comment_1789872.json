{"body": "\nHi Abraham, have been checking my surfaces which result in a closed brep and the roof is recognised as 'roof' by HBObjects, which I thought might be the problem i.e. 'non-convex' surfaces. Also reviewed Chris M's videos for making brep from surfaces but all seems fine. Made a few\u00a0 corrections to wall construction types but seemed to make no difference. I get no data results when energy sim is run, just the severe warnings as noted on attached jpeg. If you've any further suggestions about 'my end' likely problems or component issues I'd appreciate it. As mentioned I ran this in the past no problems, same PC etc. Resaved yours as Opt2.
