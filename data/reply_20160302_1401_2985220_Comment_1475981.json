{"body": "\nKraakie,\n\nYour error was to connect your OccupancySchedule to the cooling/heatingSetPtSchedules inputs in the HB_setEPZoneSchedules component. This schedules is just 1's and 0's, while you need to input temperature values. I disconnected those inputs and now it runs fine (don't know about the results quality, but it runs).\n\nAs for the HB_setZoneThresholds you needed to reinsert the component since the input items changed. Chris recently added the option to set humidity conditions.\n\nSo it is also working now. See attached.\n\nI set the lighting simulation to false and the automatic update too (it is really annoying for me having to wait for that).\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1475983", "name": "energy_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 02, 2016 at 02:01PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1476218", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1475981"}
