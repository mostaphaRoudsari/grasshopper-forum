{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nSorry for my late reply. When I run the simulation, my computer often showed \"out of memory\". I doubt the problem is because the RAM of my computer is too small (only 2G). When it crashed again, I will record the output and send it to you.\n\nBesides, I found when I input a box with three layers, the splitbuildingmass component only generate a two layers box. What seems to be the trouble? The attachment is the file. Thank you for your help.\n\nYunsong Han\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1191223", "name": "the problem of the split building mass.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Han Yunsong", "created_at": "December 18, 2014 at 3:16am", "created_by": "HanYunsong", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1188830", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1191222"}
