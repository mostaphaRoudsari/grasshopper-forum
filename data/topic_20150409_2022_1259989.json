{"body": "\nHello HB LB community!\u00a0<br/>I have a several question to ask regarding to simple Honeybee energy simulation.\n\n\n\n1. Weather file location doesn't match with the location of Honeybee_Read Ep Result.\n\nWherever i put my building mass, it calculates only in Washington DC.\n\n\n\n2. Honeybee_Generate EP output has timestep option that i set it to hourly since I am doing only short analysis, readEPResult count it as monthly.\u00a0\n\n\n\n3. Set the Analysis period only in Jan, however the calculated result is different.\n\n\n\n4. Connected zoneEnergyUse, zoneComfortMetrics, SurfaceTempAnalysis in EPOutputs but ReadEPResult gives me limited results like the Picutre Below.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vl9kv5g9jpKOwBBLoHebNHOXbOWJgVz1qSxoHHcv-AFAiX825wPW29mA*aatbMOwljCUKMl2cdeDmVn-niAcxhPvLaf1EBYO/HoneybeeProblem.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vl9kv5g9jpKOwBBLoHebNHOXbOWJgVz1qSxoHHcv-AFAiX825wPW29mA*aatbMOwljCUKMl2cdeDmVn-niAcxhPvLaf1EBYO/HoneybeeProblem.jpg)Please help me on this issues, hope you have a great advise for me.<br/><br/>And the last thing, do i have to boolean toogle off everything in order save the grasshopper file or just save it and close it?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1259988", "name": "Honeybee_problem.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "April 09, 2015 at 08:22PM", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "topic": "Issues related to Timestep", "id": "topic_1259989"}
