{"body": "\nHi Mike,\n\n\n\nIn addition to what Omid said, if you want to create a sky matrix from your data alone, you'd also need horizontal diffuse radiation values. The sky model used in Ladybug and Honeybee is based on [Perez Skies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038092X9090055H). The sky matrix is created based on [Reinhart patch subdivisions](http://www.enob.info/fileadmin/media/Publikationen/EnOB/Dissertation_C.Reinhart.pdf).\n\nBelow is a visualization of the Perez sky for a particular time and the sky-matrix corresponding to that.\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3acUQbRQgG6SO-FR9VQTfCMdxGvexjrMap7pdh5VtDVS6Kv89KF9GH1019qmyAlYvhWwNJSubngVxdWjysRGfiQadL7-rdbW/Selection_142.jpg\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" width=\"261\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3acUQbRQgG6SO-FR9VQTfCMdxGvexjrMap7pdh5VtDVS6Kv89KF9GH1019qmyAlYvhWwNJSubngVxdWjysRGfiQadL7-rdbW/Selection_142.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue with using direct solar radiation only is that you won't be able to consider the effect of sky radiation in your simulation as shown below (the image on the right is sun-only):\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3acUQbRQgG6HhXbZvfCcuDq1WCfQ6ey4Cu*4BrV4trbxd9BzDHk1RcQvC5vV8SrIW9ykIOVdxfS2p49JDPaf5hneCk4-HVEZ/Selection_143.jpg?width=261\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" width=\"261\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3acUQbRQgG6HhXbZvfCcuDq1WCfQ6ey4Cu*4BrV4trbxd9BzDHk1RcQvC5vV8SrIW9ykIOVdxfS2p49JDPaf5hneCk4-HVEZ/Selection_143.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have the hourly data for direct-normal and diffuse horizontal radiation for the entire year, generating an epw(and then the wea) file from that isn't that difficult. We should be able to help you with that.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "March 12, 2017 at 06:26AM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1709991", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1710327"}
