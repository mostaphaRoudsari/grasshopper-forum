{"body": "\n\n\nI took your 3rd option suggestion and broke the zones up to eliminate the \"L's\" which seems to work fine. Although I am a bit worried about the results after simulation. Certain zones seemed to have a lot more total energy gain then they should have. My zone_10 also seemed to have a lot more total solar gain then it should have as well. It's a zone that has a large glass facade facing south but it's heavily shaded and not nearly as exposed as the other zones with large glass south facing facades. I'm worried it has something to do with how I applied the air wall. It's odd because the surface results I'm reading seem really accurate, its the zone results that I'm not confident in. If you have some time to verify I'm not going crazy and that I set up the air wall correctly I'd really appreciate it.\n\n\n\nAaron\n\n\n\nPS: I'll make sure to direct my E+ questions to Peter Ellis' site henceforth, thanks!\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1166407", "name": "Multizone_Residence_AirWall.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "November 11, 2014 at 02:59PM", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1165874", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1166405"}
