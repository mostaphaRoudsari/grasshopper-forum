{"body": "\nHi Guys,\n\n\n\nI am new in grasshopper and honeybee so maybe my questions is quite simple. I am developing a simple parametric room model and i am trying to transform the room into a HBzone.\n\n\n\nI have descomposed the whole room into HB surfaces and apply some properties. Then, when i try to create the HBzone a problem appears. The components does not look orage or red but it said that no data is collected.\n\n\n\nCould anyone tell me where is the problem? I have attach a file.\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nEduardo\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1407130", "name": "Test_23november.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Eduardo Artigas", "created_at": "November 23, 2015 at 2:57am", "created_by": "EduardoArtigas", "topic": "Honeybee CreateHB zones problems", "id": "topic_1407131"}
