{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nok then probably was some other reason the previous issue.\n\nDon't worry no need to make predictions for the Honeybee release, it was just to have an idea :) So with Honeybee the installer will set EnergyPlus and Radiance as well? (Like DIVA) About use the epw files the interesting thing is that you can work out analysis in realtime, that's very good.\n\nI appreciate a lot the the LadyBug's direct sunlight hour calculation component. It is the first, at least in my experience, between the different environmantal analysis tools for GH that does this straight and easily. So far I used to calculate with with a whole definition I built.\n\nAbout websites for epw files I usually visit this\u00a0[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_about...](http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_about.cfm?CFID=978762&amp;CFTOKEN=93446a83f0be39a4-FF443C22-00F2-ECA9-6896C874CAA44242)\n\nthere are others? What tool you suggest to create weather files? Even if I imagine they should not bee very easy to use. I mean this more for the teaching aspect than for the research one.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your work.\n\nBest\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "June 01, 2013 at 04:38AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_864040", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_864261"}
