{"body": "\nHello everyone and thank you guys for these amazing plugins !\n\nI'm currently working on the energy modelling of Greenhouses gridshell and although it is the beginning of a long term project i'm still looking for an efficient way to perform glazing of complex shapes.\n\nI've only followed the Energy modelling workshops so far so i may have missed some essential components or workflows to achieve my needs. But i've made an attached\u00a0 definition with all my current attempts to get a proper HBzone with the numerous windows faces i will always have to deal with in this project.\n\nI first thought that i was not using the HBObjWGZ correctly, then after some readings it was maybe an upgrading issue, then effectively i had my Therm 7.5 that needed to be reinstaled, but then ... I must be missing an essential HB tricks or workflow i guess ...\n\nSo I divided my attempt in two series :\n\n\n\n\n\n- The Serie 1 : is a simplier version of the project step i'm working on but i'd be glad to achieve it first !\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/aUSeK2H4tDj9Mm6eyQcSRxsQLSOWfVtf1S47p0mesFnDHmaar8HLx-HzAoFNOfRouRNfFkbjuUtwcODqrlpetO1xTiLJ9Jbf/Serie_1.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/aUSeK2H4tDj9Mm6eyQcSRxsQLSOWfVtf1S47p0mesFnDHmaar8HLx-HzAoFNOfRouRNfFkbjuUtwcODqrlpetO1xTiLJ9Jbf/Serie_1.PNG)- The Serie 2 : is the real final direction of the project, which consist in sorting/dispatch faces to windowon one side and to an other material on the other, according to the winter sun and a pourcentage param.\n\nDespite it is more complicated than the Serie one, it seems seems to create the same diversity of issues.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/aUSeK2H4tDhk9UuTTPONRzcWmGrYS3bAthNGcVzzibSJzDN-HvNGvkFjUzPW1cfTNuYunUZOnowWSQDNcIXDcYMyx9Qyt9I*/Serie_2.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/aUSeK2H4tDhk9UuTTPONRzcWmGrYS3bAthNGcVzzibSJzDN-HvNGvkFjUzPW1cfTNuYunUZOnowWSQDNcIXDcYMyx9Qyt9I*/Serie_2.PNG)\n\nUntil now, with the 5 different combinations of Serie 1, and the 3 of Serie 2, with and without using the different Glazing/window components, here are the logs i got from both HBZone component or OpenStudio component:\n\n\n\nFrom OpenStudi**o - \"1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error:** <br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 ** Severe\u00a0 ** BuildingSurface:Detailed=\"00073E23257843B6A948\", invalid Construction Name=\"ETFE\" - has Window materials.\"**<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; Has to deal with the way i'm trying to assign too early a customized EPConstruction material ? Done it wrong ? I tried to reload it in the library but doesn't change anything...\n\n\n\n**From OpenStudi<em>o** - \"1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error:</em> <br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 ** Severe\u00a0 ** BuildingSurface:Detailed=\"000579CD749E46DFA5EA\", invalid Construction Name=\"EXTERIOR WINDOW\" - has Window materials.\"**<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; Is it an issue in the way i define my surfs both as \"WINDOW\" (5) for srfType and Outdoors on the same component ?\n\n\n\nFrom **Create HBZone** -\"1**. Solution exception:'EPZone' object has no attribute 'shdCntrlZoneInstructs'\"**\n\n&gt;&gt; Happens when i try to introduce my ETFE EpMaterial after creating my first HBZone, with a Set EP Zone Construction, so this material seems to be not working either before and after trying to create an HB Zone\n\n\n\n**From <em>Create HBZone**- \"1. Solution exception: 73df51a3b2144b1e858b has been moved, scaled or rotated.\"</em><br/>**If you need to move or rotate a Honeybee object you should use Honeybee move, rotate or mirror components. You can find them under 12|WIP tab.**\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wich seems to exist in some on other thread\u00a0[Here](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/how-to-specify-a-new-for-a-glazing-surface?xg_source=activity) and was a coding bug supposed to be fixed.\n\n\n\nAnd last but not least ...\n\n\n\nFrom **OpenStudio** - \"**1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error:** <br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 ** Severe\u00a0 ** checkSubSurfAzTiltNorm: Outward facing angle of subsurface differs more than 90.0 degrees from base surface.**<br/><br/><br/>**2. The simulation has failed because of this fatal error:** <br/>**\u00a0\u00a0 **\u00a0 Fatal\u00a0 ** GetSurfaceData: Errors discovered, program terminates\" .**<br/><br/>\n\nI'm attaching the file with each attempt in this post. The definitions are disabled and the log already copied separatly so there is no need to compute each of them to see what's wrong.\n\nIf someone from the beginner to one of the Kings of HoneyBee has any relevant\u00a0 answer/solution to this attempt with complex geometry Issue it will be really nice for me so i could to move forward !!\n\n\n\nThanks in advance guys and have a great day !\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1779556", "name": "ShellGlazing.gh"}], "created_by_name": "edwin szabo", "created_at": "July 06, 2017 at 03:32AM", "created_by": "edwinszabo", "topic": "Complex geometry Glazing issues", "id": "topic_1779557"}
