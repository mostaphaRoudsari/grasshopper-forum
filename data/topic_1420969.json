{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,[<br/>](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari)\n\n\n\nRecently, I'm trying to connect Gambit and Fluent with grasshopper to run CFD simulation. I learned much from Ladybug&amp;Honeybee codes. Now I wanted to write a batch file to call the simulation software as you do in the \"runDaylightAnalysis\" or \"runEnergySimulation\" component. But I can not fully understand your codes.\n\n\n\nbatchStr = workingDrive + '\\ncd\\\\' + folderName + '\\n' + EPDirectory + \\<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'\\\\Epl-run ' + fullPath + ' ' + fullPath + ' idf ' + epwFileAddress +\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0' EP N nolimit N N 0 Y'\n\n\n\nBelow is my code, which I imitate what you write. I think it still needs to be modified. Gambit is an execute programming, and I want to use it to run .jou file. I don't know why two \"fullPath\" are needed.\n\n\n\nbatchStr = workingDrive + '\\ncd\\\\' + folderName + '\\n' + GambitDirectory + \\<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 '\\\\gambit ' + fullPath + ' ' + fullPath + ' jou '\n\n\n\nCould you give me any suggestions? Thanks a lot. Looking forward for your reply.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\nDan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Hou", "created_at": "December 14, 2015 at 8:37am", "created_by": "DanHou", "topic": "How to write batch file to call the simulation software?", "id": "topic_1420969"}
