{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nI am working on a research project. I have three buildings with different height that I have to place on a plot. The goal is that the building create as less as possible overshadowing on each other. So I am calculating the result separately because each time one building is the Geometry (input) and the other two are the Context (input). If I would calculate together I have to use all the buildings at the same time as Geometry and as Context, so I thought that if a building is Geometry and Context at the same time the calculation can get wrong. Isn't it?\n\nThank you for the indication about Octopus, I will see about it.\n\nWell yes I am using quite a lot your tool recently, thank you for your work. I am preparing the materials for a workshop about these topics I will tutor in my university and I think I will use LadyBug and Diva. By the way there are limitations in the use of your plug-in?\n\n\n\nBest\n\nFrancesco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "June 08, 2013 at 06:34AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_881160", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_868179"}
