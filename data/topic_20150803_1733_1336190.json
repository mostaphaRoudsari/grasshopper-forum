{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI have encountered an error using Honeybee with regards to its support for EP 8.3. I have installed the latest version of Ladybug+Honeybee along with the Energy Plus V8-3-0. Once I load the Honeybee_Honeybee component, I receive the error message indicating that \"Honeybee cannot find EnergyPlusV8-1-0 folder on your system\".\n\nI have looked up the UserObjects repository on Honeybee Github and noticed there are two components with a comment as \"All Clear for EP 8.3 Support\". I have downloaded and replaced these two component on my local userObjects folder for grasshopper.\n\nHowever, I still encounter the error message indicating Honeybee is looking for EnergyPlusV8-1-0.\n\nI would appreciate if you could help me with this problem.\n\nThank you\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alireza", "created_at": "August 03, 2015 at 05:33PM", "created_by": "Alireza", "topic": "Honeybee: Support for Energy Plus 8.3", "id": "topic_1336190"}
