{"body": "\nHappy Valentines day, everyone!\n\n\n\nI have updated my components with the following:\n\n1. Added new icons\n\n2. Changed the inputs conditionals so they behave the same way as the rest of the LB components.\n\n3. Modified the SolarFan boolean union method, to deal with complex input geometries in a more user-friendly way.\u00a0\n\n4. Added the 4 dates option!\n\n5.
