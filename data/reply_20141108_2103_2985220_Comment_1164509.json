{"body": "\nHi Chris and Leland, I'm very late to the party but let's see if I can address the questions here.\n\n1. Please find the attached file for the fixed version of the component. I ran comparative studies between 3 different types of sky for Ladybug and also Radiance and the difference is less than 5%.\n\n2. Ladybug is using gendaymtx to generate the sky. You can read the details here:\u00a0[http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/...](http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/gendaymtx.pdf)\n\n3. You can use Daysim subprogram ds_shortterm to generate the sky for less than and hour timesteps ([http://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-subprogram-ds-shortterm-1](http://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-subprogram-ds-shortterm-1)) but then the number of patches will be limited to 145 patches. It is not applied to Honeybee.\n\n4. Sky is almost 0 on the top because of the bug that you found. The value for the last row of patches was missing from the code. It should be fixed now.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1164810", "name": "SkyMtxRHSky_fixed.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 08, 2014 at 09:03PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163776", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1164509"}
