{"body": "\nJorge,\n\n\n\nAdmittedly, I wrote those recommendations in the description without being certain which ASHRAE publication that they came from.\u00a0 There's a chance that it might come from the analysis of CBECS data but I am not entirely sure.\n\n\n\nTo show that those numbers are not totally unfounded, here are the results of a real study of 65 buildings that have had their infiltration measured using a blower door test:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/99aVnO*4LGeGg4VWNuciH8WjuUYt66cNHbDEleLYIOsG5ELGE9rvgODdpT6JJ9lxNesgdeRqUja3S9o3WvFP*RWSSjqt3qWc/Infiltration.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/99aVnO*4LGeGg4VWNuciH8WjuUYt66cNHbDEleLYIOsG5ELGE9rvgODdpT6JJ9lxNesgdeRqUja3S9o3WvFP*RWSSjqt3qWc/Infiltration.JPG)\n\n\n\nTo help convert from the crazy IP/SI hybrid numbers here:\n\n0.75 cfm/ft2 at 75Pa corresponds to 0.0006 m3/s-m2 at 4Pa (Leaky Building)\n\n0.5 cfm/ft2 at 75Pa corresponds to 0.0003 m3/s-m2 at 4Pa (Average Building)\n\n0.25 cfm/ft2 at 75Pa corresponds to 0.0001 m3/s-m2 at 4Pa (Tight Building)\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the range of real results generally correspond to the three recommended classes but there are 7 buildings that are so leaky that they are in their own category and there are number of buildings by the army core of engineers (ACE) that are consistently below the tight building class (although it's usually not too far below).\n\n\n\nI hope this helps give a better sense of the possible range of infiltration.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 07, 2016 at 03:49PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1611980", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1613679"}
