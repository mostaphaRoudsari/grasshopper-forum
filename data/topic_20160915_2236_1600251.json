{"body": "\nWondering what the \"xScale\" and \"yScale\" Radiance Parameters do, which are reported by the Honeybee Radiance Rad parameters component.\n\n\n\nThey are not described as rtrace parameters, which is what i thought this HB component controls.\n\n[http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rtrace.1.html](http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rtrace.1.html)\n\n\n\nDiscussion of them shows up here, but again no documentation for what these parameters adjust within the simulation.\n\n\n\n[http://www.radiance-online.org:82/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-J...](http://www.radiance-online.org:82/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011005.html)\n\n\n\nAny guidance here for where to look to understand what these parameters are doing? Or for what appropriate values should be?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Octagon26", "created_at": "September 15, 2016 at 10:36PM", "created_by": "Octagon26", "topic": "What are the \"xScale\" and \"yScale\" Radiance Parameters?", "id": "topic_1600251"}
