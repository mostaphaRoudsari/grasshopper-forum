{"body": "\nDear Sarith,\n\n\n\nThanks for your comments. The six coefficients under gendaylit.c is from line 25 (following the link of [http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/gen/gend...](http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/gen/gendaylit.c?view=markup)) as below:\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/aSfoUc8VkEE3vyEwI0NiDidyXzC6HARV7ldzuv5*V6hQk*s9whA2lFc-JxxV3Ic9PucsFZtdL5wxpjiXvsTPPAzEQOzJUS1X/perezcoefficientsundergendaylit.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/aSfoUc8VkEE3vyEwI0NiDidyXzC6HARV7ldzuv5*V6hQk*s9whA2lFc-JxxV3Ic9PucsFZtdL5wxpjiXvsTPPAzEQOzJUS1X/perezcoefficientsundergendaylit.JPG)\n\n\n\nfloat coeff_perez [] is from Perez's paper in solar energy vol. 50, No.3. pp235-245, 1993.\u00a0\n\n\n\ni would like to adjust A3, A4, A5, A6 and A7 using measurement irradiance data over a whole year for every minute or hour, and update these coefficients under the file perezlum.cal. It means i may need to re-compile gendaylit.exe, which i have no idea how to do it.\u00a0\n\n\n\ni found radiance has another version on gendaymtx.c v2.13. it includes static const double PerezCoeff[8][20]. I am wondering which version of gendaymtx does ladybug GenCumulativeSkyMtx use.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your suggestions on honeybee plugin. I will take a look and see how.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCheers,\u00a0\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Le", "created_at": "March 27, 2017 at 10:07pm", "created_by": "XULE", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714820", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1722361"}
