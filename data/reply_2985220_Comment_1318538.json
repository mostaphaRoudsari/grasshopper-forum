{"body": "\nLeland and Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThere are definitely some simple ways around this (I was making models that were as many as 70 zones for my thesis) and there are some more complex ones if you really need a specific slice of the data.\n\nFirst things that I can recommend: if you can run the simulation for just an analysis period that you are interested in, this can really cut down the parsing time and memory a lot. \u00a0Try running the simulation for a typical or extreme hot/cold week to see if you can test the thing you are interested in this way. \u00a0This was primarily how I got around the issue for my thesis and I can say that the comfort map workflow allows you to scroll through the data any way you like even when it is not an annual simulation (in the past, it needed to be an annual sim to use the analysisPeriod input). \u00a0I just implemented this feature on the color zones and color surfaces components ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/519823b5a3a9c85...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/519823b5a3a9c85b449733268dbf07dd65ee245e)).\n\nSecond, if you can curate the outputs that you are interested in from the \"simulationOutputs\" of the \"Generate EP Output\" component, this will also cut down on the amount of data you are bringing in through the result reader. \u00a0Obviously, cutting out surface outputs cuts down the amount of imported data way more than zone outputs.\n\nThird, if you can accept not bringing in hourly results but just monthly or total results for some of the outputs, this also cuts down on the data substantially.\n\nForth, as a last-ditch effort you can always connect up just the zones that you are interested in to the Run Simulation component and put adiabatic surfaces for the adjacencent surfaces. \u00a0I know that this is not ideal from a simulation accuracy perspective but it is clearly better than no results at all. \u00a0I recently updated the \"Make Adiabatic by Type\" component to allow you to make any type of surface adiabatic and this should help with setting such cases up ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/1b5329ca61d9547...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/1b5329ca61d95473d8371c5b82c72f630503c862)).\n\n\n\nTo be clear about the sql option: I agree that this is the best way to deal with the huge data sets we get out of E+ and I have been wanting to develop this ability into the Run Simulation workflow for a while. \u00a0However, I have been unable to move forward because the parsing of the sql file relies on the openStudio parser (asking people to download a separate sqlLite parser and writing corresponding code for it seems to just be too much work). I experience the OpenStudio PINVOKE error on my system and so this has halted my ability to develop such a workflow.\n\n\n\nWith a few hours, I can write the ability into the Read EP Result component to only bring in data for a HBZones input that I can add. \u00a0I have been questioning whether this would be worth it because I was still holding out hope that the PINVOKE error would be solved. \u00a0Mostapha, could you let me know what time frame you think it would take to fix the PINVOKE error? \u00a0Knowing that will help me decide whether it's worth it to invest in an input on the current result reader. \u00a0Also, let me know if there are any ways that I might help or I might begin researching a solution.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 30, 2015 at 10:50pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1316583", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1318538"}
