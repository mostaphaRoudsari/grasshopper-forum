{"body": "\nHello Mostapha and thank for the reply:\n\n\n\n2. Ok great. I will try that out\u00a0\n\n\n\n3. I just started setting up the experiment and developing a agent based system in java using iGEO library for that. We will soon publish a paper presenting the framework and \u00a0hope to have some interesting results soon. For now, I am using annual simulation, for specific time zones that relate to the function of the sapce(i.e. \u00a0office:9-5) and measure the continuous daylight autonomy and the useful daylight illuminance of the space\n\n\n\nPs: Would be great meet here in LA if you are visiting. You are wellcome to come and visit at USC and maybe I can arrange with the Engineering dept to give a presentation of the tool/your work if you have some extra time\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Evangelos Pantazis", "created_at": "December 18, 2014 at 5:47pm", "created_by": "EvangelosPantazis", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1188659", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1191386"}
