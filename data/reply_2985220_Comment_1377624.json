{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\n\n\nI like your idea of using VSC to calculate a Sky View Factor. Unfortunately, because VSC is affected by glazing properties and reflected light, the same sky view could result in different VSC values if the model material properties change.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you removed all of your glass and calculated a single\u00a0ray (ab-0) run under uniform sky conditions, that might work.\u00a0I never use VSC, so I might be off here, but that sounds reasonable. What do you think?\n\n\u00a0\n\n-Leland\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "October 12, 2015 at 7:32am", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "topic_1377260", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1377624"}
