{"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\nI could not agree :-)\n\nThere ave been many request/questions on the forum regarding how to render only a group of hours (night hours, or otherwise) without taking those in between.\n\nThe HOY input can be a good way to implement. I think we can do it, and if it works smoothly i don't think Mostapha or Chris will oppose.\n\nThe title for such cases should say something like \"output for user selected hours\", or something similar, since with the HOY input i can give random hours. It will be difficult to write in the title all of those.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 02, 2017 at 09:10PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1683940", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1684044"}
