{"body": "\nHi Mostahpa,\n\nI have found a mistake on my model! I gathered all the interior surfaces in the same \"createHBSrfs\" not distinguishing between Ceilings and Interior Walls.\n\nI thought that \"solveAdj\" would do it for me. But I created a simpler model and I realized that was the problem. At least one of the possible several errors I might have.\u00a0\n\nSo don't waste your time. I will ask you again if I find more problems. :)\n\nEduard\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Eduard Nunez", "created_at": "June 02, 2016 at 06:12AM", "created_by": "EduardNunez", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1540158", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1540815"}
