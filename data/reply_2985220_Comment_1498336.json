{"body": "\nJacob,\n\nI don't understand what you are trying to run with the \"window in window\" situation.\u00a0 A window cannot be the child of another window. Input the two separate window surfaces with one AddHBGlz component and make sure that these two window surfaces do not overlap.\u00a0 In other words, trim out the area of the small window form the large window.\u00a0 To answer your questions:\n\n\n\n1) In what format do you have the DGP values?\u00a0 If you have DGP values in a csv format, just import them into GH like so:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/iwhKaf*i-h2N8yn*xaPc3xJNOZaDiYsuPS9f1TDo7VW0*VgPix5OKgAbgKpJ17O3dBMJGXLFtLMRLRFOjhPHW*-L78BvC7Eb/CsvFileParser.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/iwhKaf*i-h2N8yn*xaPc3xJNOZaDiYsuPS9f1TDo7VW0*VgPix5OKgAbgKpJ17O3dBMJGXLFtLMRLRFOjhPHW*-L78BvC7Eb/CsvFileParser.JPG)\n\n2) See above.\u00a0 Your initial \"window in window\" case is \"not a problem\" because your large window is being modeled as opaque.\n\n\n\n3) Several dimming stages with a single setpoints is not currently an option with EnergyPlus's switchable glazing object.\u00a0 If you want to have dimming, you are going to have to create a custom csv schedule of 8760 fraction values (from 0 to 1) that represent how dimmed the window is.\u00a0 You will have to figure out these 8760 values before running the simulation using the DGP value and the temperature (from an EPW file if outdoor or perhaps from an initial energy simulation if indoor).\u00a0 Plug this schedule into the shadeSchedule of the \"EnergyPlus Window Shade Generator.\"\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 1, 2016 at 9:50am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1498077", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1498336"}
