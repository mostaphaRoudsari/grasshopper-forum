{"body": "\nHi Chris\n\nThank you, Chris! I'm really interested in Ladybug+Honeybee! It would be great to add it to Ladybug_Ladybug and the component, too.\n\nHaving followed your advice about changing the inputs, I have modified the<br/>component. If you are interested in, you can see the attached file. I know it is not perfect it needs some revisions, but it works very good. And if you want you will edit it. It would be great learn more about Python, so your helpfulness is very welcome.\n\n<br/>About Ladybug github... I need a guidance, yes. This is a new world for me, but I'm really happy to discover it!\n\n<br/>Thank you again, Chris! Please, let me know about the component.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1440444", "name": "Ladybug_WetBulbTemperature_review02.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "January 17, 2016 at 02:21PM", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1440128", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1440443"}
