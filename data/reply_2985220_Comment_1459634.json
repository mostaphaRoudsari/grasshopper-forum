{"body": "\nHey Mostapha,\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you for the fast reply.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe windows were generated using Rhino geometry imported from Sketchup, but I also tried using the glazing based on ratio component, which resulted in the same error.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI fixed the\u00a0non-convex surfaces in the model, which in turn fixed the window error. Now there is only a small visualization thing, as shown in the attached picture.\u00a0\n\n\n\n- Nickolaj\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1459636", "name": "Pic1.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Nickolaj Feldt Jensen", "created_at": "February 10, 2016 at 3:15am", "created_by": "NickolajFeldtJensen", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1454633", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1459634"}
