{"body": "\nThank you very much Mauricio for your helpful explanation.\n\nHowever I think for a solid material radiative and convective transfer would affect insignificantly,dont they? I guess the main reason of the huge difference between results was due to Hc parameter(w/m.k)which I have no idea of defining it. It is thermal conductivity of thin air film near boundaries. Is it related to the material specifications like reflectivity, emissivity and absorptance? or it is just defined by weather conditions like wind velocity, humidity,...?\n\nthanks.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Farnaz", "created_at": "May 15, 2016 at 12:38AM", "created_by": "Farnaz609", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1527243", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1530397"}
