{"body": "\nHi mostapha.\n\nWhich kinds of CFD modellings are included in this version?\n\nI'm looking for a means of modelling vertical temperature distributions in large atria.<br/>My idea was to cheat, using simple Honeybee tools (vertically dividing the big zone into sub-zones with 'air walls'), but the 'air wall' feature does not seem to allow direct solar radiation and air flow, thus this work-around does not seem to do the job. So it seems I have to go on to CFD modelling.\n\nCan this tool comprehent heat flows - maybe translated into wind speeds due to this flow - or does it only model urban wind flows?\n\nThanks\n\n- Hamborg\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lasse Hamborg", "created_at": "October 21, 2016 at 11:24AM", "created_by": "LasseHamborg", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1560659", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1622935"}
