{"body": "\nHi Chris, Mostapha and others.\n\nSo I think Github is a fantastic solution, and it's a lot less work, but it has a couple drawbacks that you've probably already noticed.\n\nIf the goal of the wiki is to primarily act as documentation, and secondarily act as a forum, I think this is fine. You can encourage users to use the issues page if they have questions (these can act like small discussion threads). And you can create a FAQ page if needed. If you'd like auto-generate pages, remember that it is possible to create a separate repo for your wiki and that it can be composed entirely of plain-text markdown files.\n\nFor big binary files that might be provided as downloads, you can put them anywhere (dropbox, google docs) and then just grab a download link.\n\nAlso, I'm sure there's a lot more out of the box wiki-style content management systems that you could probably install for php on a basic linux server. You may want to do a little more research into wiki-style or discussion board style CMS.\n\nI'm curious what you choose, as I often face similar dilemmas.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Benjamin Golder", "created_at": "July 7, 2014 at 5:19am", "created_by": "BenjaminGolder", "parent_id": "topic_1098315", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1098522"}
