{"body": "\nHi Jack,\n\nAttached a working version of your file. See the yellow frames in the file to see what i changed/added. The first one didn't affect the result but as a question of \"good behaviour\" define the type of camera and the type of render. The second one worked for your case, though right now i'm not sure why it worked well. It\u00a0 only re-render the picture adjusting the exposure. I didn't think it is supposed to affect that much. The only thing is maybe that you are using a previous \"old\" version (the release version). You can see that the second yellow have more updated dates in the components. I added another group where you can update automatically the file to the last repository in the github both the file and the library of components. Just be careful with this one since there are some components that change the names of the inputs/outputs or the numbers of inputs and outputs. Those are not updated properly in the document, so you need to insert the updated component from the menu and reconnect the whole thing.\n\nProbably Mostapha can explain much better than i did, but in the meantime you can run (or walk).\n\n-A.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1079094", "name": "000_GettingStarted_With_Honeybee_A.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1079095", "name": "JackTest_RAD_Perspective@exp_0500.GIF"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 27, 2014 at 04:00PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1079237", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1079093"}
