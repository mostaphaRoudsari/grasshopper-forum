{"body": "\nHi Kostas,\n\nDidn't get well the \"behind the walls\" issue, but for the transparency you have 2 options:\n\n1. Using the LB_shadingMask (as you are doing) there is no option in GH. Just to bake the resulting geometry and do the transparency directly in Rhino.\n\n2. Use the LB_shadingMaskII (the one with the colors). Then you can play with the color and transparency if you conect the appropriate outputs to a CustomPrevie component. The pitfall is that is a kind of proof of concept version of the component and can take some time to do the calculation. This is the one Mostapha shows in the comments section a while ago.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 1, 2014 at 10:08am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1140731", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1140866"}
