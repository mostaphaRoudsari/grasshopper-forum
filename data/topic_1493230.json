{"body": "\nHey guys,\n\nI'm trying to asses the local thermal discomfort related to radiant asymmetry. To do that I need to calculate the radiant asymmetry, which is done by multiplying surface temperatures with their view factor and summing it all together.\u00a0\n\nFrom what I can read this is basically the same way you calculate MRT right? So my question is can I replace t_pr in the equations of EN 7730-2006 with MRT?\n\nIf not is there a way to use HB's view factor component to calculate radiant asymmetry?\n\nEDIT: I now see that you have to use radiant temperature asymmetry (delta_t_pr) and not t_pr for the EN calculation. Do anyone have an idea how to calculate that from the HB components?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nChristian\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Kongsgaard", "created_at": "March 27, 2016 at 7:10am", "created_by": "ChristianKongsgaard", "topic": "Radiant Asymmetry and MRT", "id": "topic_1493230"}
