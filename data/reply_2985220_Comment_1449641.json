{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThis is the rookie question and I apologize. I downloaded the example Mostapha shared in the new version announcement. Somehow the air gap material doesn't exist in the library. I tried going over the available materials and it wasn't there.\n\n\n\nNow this is not bug ofc, as the whole thing works when I change it to anything in the library. But the air gap would be an important material to have in these. I wonder if it is my fault missing this or I need to create one with the components?\n\n<br/>Sorry for taking your time about this small matter.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 28, 2016 at 10:18pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1431061", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1449641"}
