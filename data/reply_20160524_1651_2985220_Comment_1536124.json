{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nJust wondering how you get to the screen perforated geometry in the image above. Using the EPWindowShades I'm defining a shade type: Shades with any value in airPermeability (greater than 0), but the geometry shows no difference changing this value. Don't see any other input relevant to the setting of the openness of the shade.\n\nI want to use this for a daylight simulation.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"undefined\"/>](http://undefined)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 24, 2016 at 04:51PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1532206", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1536124"}
