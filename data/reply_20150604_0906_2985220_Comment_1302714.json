{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nthank you very much for your quick reply. First of all I have to apologise for that file. While I cleaned it up to make it easily readable I was too scrubwoman-like and deleted more than I wanted. Nevertheless, still there is something I simply can't define. If you compare the two gh-files somewhere in the components must be a bug. I reinstalled everything today (gh, LB, HB, rad/daysim/e+) but the older file still doesn't work. I updated the components, copy-pasted yours in a new file from srf-definition on and combined it with my components before. And it runs. Any idea?\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1302716", "name": "150605_SETUP.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1302717", "name": "150606_SETUP.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "June 04, 2015 at 09:06AM", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1301995", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1302714"}
