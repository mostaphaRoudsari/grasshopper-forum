{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI've been trying quite a while to make the attached to work but without success.\n\nIt started as a section that included part of a wall. Now i took out this part and left only the window.\n\nThe HB_writeTHERM complains about:\n\nGeometry connected to _polygons does not have a single boundary (there are holes in the model). \u00a0You will have to fill in these gaps when you bring your model into THERM.\n\nI can't see where these gaps can be. Tried the dupborder check, but nothing.\n\nOpening the created therm file in THERM gives me:\n\nThere are points in the model that are closer together than the program tolerance.\n\nBut also there i can see where is/are the faulty geometries.\n\n\n\nWill appreciate any help here to understand what i'm doing wrong.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1671721", "name": "ThermSection.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 13, 2017 at 12:42pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "THERM - Window section issues", "id": "topic_1671722"}
