{"body": "\nHi Angelo,\n\nThanks for using Dragonfly and I think this results from having wall/roof construction materials that are thinner than 1 cm. \u00a0Having materials this thin messes up the UWG's heat flow calculation through the construction and I would recommend removing such thin materials as they usually have a negligible effect on the results. \u00a0If you upload your Dragonfly GH file, I can check whether this is the case.\n\nI know the new UWG has a check for construction materials this thin and, once I upgrade Dragonfly to this new version, you should not have to worry about this type of error again.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 10, 2017 at 10:16am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1730861", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1730950"}
