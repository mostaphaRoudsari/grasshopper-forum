{"body": "\nHi!\n\nEven though I have installed EnergyPlus in my computer, I'm getting que following warning with the Honeybee component :\n\n\n\n**\"3. Honeybee cannot find EnergyPlusV8-1-0 folder on your system.**<br/>**Make sure you have EnergyPlusV8-1-0 installed on your system.**<br/>**You won't be able to run energy simulations without EnergyPlus.**<br/>**A good place to install EnergyPlus is c:\\EnergyPlusV8-1-.\"\u00a0**\n\n\n\nThe Energy+ version I have in my computer is 8.5.0 and is in c:\\EnergyPlusV8-5-0.\u00a0I'm guessing the component doesn't recognise the E+ latest version. In that case, should I try to install an older version? Which one?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you!\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1549113", "name": "honeybee_warning.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Ana Carolina Moura", "created_at": "June 16, 2016 at 9:50am", "created_by": "AnaCarolinaMoura", "topic": "Honeybee cannot find EnergyPlusV8-1-0 folder on your system", "id": "topic_1549114"}
