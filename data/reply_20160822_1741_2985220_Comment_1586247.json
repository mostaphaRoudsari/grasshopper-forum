{"body": "\nJulia,\n\nThank you for posting this. It seems the issue was as I feared. \u00a0All of the components in your Grasshopper file are up to date and your GH file is running fine for me. \u00a0So it is a bug affecting your system type just as the previous bug.\n\nWould you mind opening the attached version of your file and let me know what the text in the panel is?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DmYnIaXFmPqFSEHVsQcDVIrGPiFQwywWOG4erAFlGq4ljZBFo-YYpMTd5crkDshy7mumo*LwlAeb-4-8ixv-jxQN5qkr2sNF/PostThisText.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DmYnIaXFmPqFSEHVsQcDVIrGPiFQwywWOG4erAFlGq4ljZBFo-YYpMTd5crkDshy7mumo*LwlAeb-4-8ixv-jxQN5qkr2sNF/PostThisText.JPG)\n\nThis will help me understand what version of OpenStudio the component is finding on your system. \u00a0Perhaps there's still a chance that it found an old version of OpenStudio somewhere.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1586248", "name": "JS_ExportToOSExample_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 22, 2016 at 05:41PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1585359", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1586247"}
