{"body": "\nHi Erik,<br/><br/>You can not choose which component outputs will be calculated and which not.<br/>You can see in this\u00a0[video where optimal tilt-azimuth is being searched with Galapagos](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/video/annual-optimal-tilt-and-azimuth-angle-of-an-unshaded-pv-array) that the speed is also slow. I speeded up the framerate 40 times. If I remember correctly the Galapagos was working for a couple of hours. In your case it may work less as you only have one slider connected to the **Genome** input.<br/><br/>This is one of the reasons why TOF component should be used, instead.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 8, 2016 at 4:48am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "topic_1561998", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1562413"}
