{"body": "\nSounds good Mostapha.\n\n\n\nI already contacted openfoam for the windows version, hoping they are liberal in sharing it.\n\n\n\nI was thinking. The most difficult part usually, at least in terms of opensource software availability, is grid generation. While most solvers are free good grid generators are not, and extremely expensive. Is Rhino up for this job? Really haven't given it much though as of now, will try and look into it myself\n\n\n\nAnyways, exciting stuff!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "July 19, 2015 at 7:37pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1328271", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1328539"}
