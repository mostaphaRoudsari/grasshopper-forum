{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nI struggled with the input name when I made the component because I originally thought that people would plug in an actual calculated prevailing outdoor temperature (which the component accepts if it doesn't find the \"Dry Bulb Temperature\" in the header of the data). \u00a0It was only afterwards that I realized that (practically every time) you want to just plug in outdoor air temperature and have the component figure things out for you. \u00a0Would just plain old \"outdoorTemperature\" be a better name or does the vagueness of it make it worse?\n\n\n\nHere is the part of the code where I calculate the prevailing outdoor temperature:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/Ladybug...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/Ladybug_Adaptive%20Comfort%20Chart.py#L239-L266)\n\nAs you see, there are different formulas used for average monthly and the running mean. \u00a0If you are curious about how this prevailing outdoor standard evolved, I would recommend this book:\n\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=lOZzCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontco...](https://books.google.com/books?id=lOZzCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=adaptive+thermal+comfort&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj42qO_ufTOAhXG9h4KHSukAV8Q6AEIIzAB)\n\n\n\nFinally, I fixed the issue with the polygon not displaying:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/71cc4200608b5d67...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/71cc4200608b5d677fcecfc33a16fdc0520b8d2b)\n\nThanks for reporting that.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 3, 2016 at 6:27pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1593079", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1593097"}
