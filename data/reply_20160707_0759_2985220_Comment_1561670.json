{"body": "\nIt's better, but here's still a problem in displaying things... The first picture is in the Ghosted mode, as in your screenshot. But I'm obtaining it better in the Rendered mode (second screenshot). Might this be related to the display problem I was talking about earlier?\n\nYou are ok. You have the **\"mesh wires\"** enabled in the first display mode, and do not have them in the second one. So use the second one (that being **Rendered** I suppose).\n\n\n\nAnd then for the isocurves, there are still not appearing, even when baked...\n\n<br/>Can you please:<br/>a) attach the .3dm file which contains the baked results of the TOF component?\n\nb) internalize the data, coming out of the TOF component's **geometry** output, and then attach that .gh file?<br/>So basically you right click on the geometry parameter and choose **Internalise data**. Then save the .gh file an attach it:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2mxGt-70BGHhz*2cLkW01mB-w55ElPgSq-4QoPJbF-7V6CWaAhbgjWBFYVRKwsskpYnfufy4tadZgNH4ijGjnOH9scKtxl7U/TOF_internalized_geometry.jpg?width=200\" width=\"200\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2mxGt-70BGHhz*2cLkW01mB-w55ElPgSq-4QoPJbF-7V6CWaAhbgjWBFYVRKwsskpYnfufy4tadZgNH4ijGjnOH9scKtxl7U/TOF_internalized_geometry.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 07, 2016 at 07:59AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1561545", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1561670"}
