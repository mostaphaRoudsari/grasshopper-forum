{"body": "\nAttached file didn't work either.\n\nI changed the default folder to C:\\Ladybug and it works!\n\nBut C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug doesn't (shows C:\\Diva\\Dayl... error).\n\n\n\nHow can I set the default folder to C:\\Ladybug as standard?\n\n\n\nImporting materials is also no longer a problem.\n\n\n\nThank you for your time. I appreciate your work very much and I hope next time I will ask something more important.\n\n-Jakob\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jakob Schmidt", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 02:46AM", "created_by": "JakobSchmidt", "parent_id": "topic_1482234", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1487299"}
