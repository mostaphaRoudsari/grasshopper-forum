{"body": "\nHi Antonello,<br/><br/>Thank you for the attached file. Both surfaces you internalized work at my place without a problem.\n\n<br/>I've noticed one inconsistency between the Terrain Generator and Terrain Generator 2 components.<br/>At Terrain Generator 2 component, the \"origin_\" input and \"originPt\" output represent a point of the terrain. So the terrain surface or mesh will be created starting from that spot, where that spot is actually lying on the very terrain.<br/>I noticed that this is not the case with \"_basePoint\" input of Terrain Generator component.<br/>In that case, in order for it to be able to use the Terrain Analysis component, one has to project the \"_basePoint\" to terrain mesh/surface.\n\n<br/>We tried to fix the WebClient class issue with Mostapha and Chris last year, but without success. Eventually I will have to buy a new PC and install a newer operating system, which will remove the issue. Until then I will not be able to test some of other people's component's which use this class.<br/>I apologize if this is causing you any inconvenience.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "October 1, 2016 at 10:36am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1608977", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1609134"}
