{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\nThe file let me starting the analysis, and I could get the files .idf, .bat, .rvaudit but not the files .eio and .csv. Using the program EnergyPlus (the external program, not the Grasshopper plug-in) I could get those files but I still have the two following problems:\n\n1. Your simulation probably did not run correctly.\u00a0<br/>Check the report out of the Run Simulation component to see what severe or fatal errors happened in the simulation.\u00a0<br/>If there are no severe or fatal errors, the issue could just be that there is .eio file adjacent to the .csv _resultFileAddress.\u00a0<br/>Check the folder of the file address you are plugging into this component and make sure that there is both a .csv and .eio file in the folder.\n\n2. No surface information was found in the imported .eio file adjacent to the .csv _resultFileAddress.Data cannot be normalized by surface area and the data tree outputs for surface data will not be grafted by zone.\n\n\n\nCan you help me please?\n\n\n\nThank you\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1782666", "name": "TESTV00.0220170601DB.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1782667", "name": "THESISV00.0220170619DB.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1782668", "name": "ITA_Venice.161050_IWEC.epw"}], "created_by_name": "DAVIDE BAROLO", "created_at": "July 12, 2017 at 3:15am", "created_by": "DAVIDEBAROLO", "topic": "error simulation: files .eio and .csv", "id": "topic_1782669"}
