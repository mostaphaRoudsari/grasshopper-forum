{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nAs Abrham showed, you can run a window of any shape with blinds and it is just that E+'s simplified model of blinds does not work if you put them too close to the glass (or more than a meter away). \u00a0\n\nGlad that you figured out the issue with the trianges. \u00a0The general principle holds that, the cleaner your geometry that you input into Honeybee, the cleaner all future geometric operations will be off of that geometry. \u00a0To give you the power to minimize triangles for simple geometries like that here, I just implemented a new feature on the glazing by ratio component. \u00a0If you plug in quadrilateral surfaces with \"breakUpWindow\" set to False, you will get just one window for each surface:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/BKb27P3JwiGaubPslDceukraz2FULCLV6tXftM47PdHXTLdVDb*Q7Hx3OuDWAU0HctZR9UZklR-xdjzI11gV49hubn7JIWIg/FalseBreakup.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/BKb27P3JwiGaubPslDceukraz2FULCLV6tXftM47PdHXTLdVDb*Q7Hx3OuDWAU0HctZR9UZklR-xdjzI11gV49hubn7JIWIg/FalseBreakup.JPG)\n\nIf you set\u00a0\"breakUpWindow\" to True, you get a triangle with rectangles and subsequently have the ability to adjust the window and sill height on the rectangles:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/BKb27P3JwiHJxUMSPvAd7CX3OkIWdAWcGxofNwk3eQj2QjJIFtuuj0nt3TBs5XUq8v1g6CofgUsbG879tC1rcA7qATH6haQq/TrueBreakup.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/BKb27P3JwiHJxUMSPvAd7CX3OkIWdAWcGxofNwk3eQj2QjJIFtuuj0nt3TBs5XUq8v1g6CofgUsbG879tC1rcA7qATH6haQq/TrueBreakup.JPG)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 26, 2015 at 10:33pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1348183", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1349678"}
