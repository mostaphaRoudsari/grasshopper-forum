{"body": "\nHi Guys,\n\n\n\nSorry for the delay in getting back to you both I re-wrote the code so that the % of area that the cells cover of HB surface that the cells are mounted on is automatically calculated for the simple mode according to the equation:\n\n\n\n% surface covered by solarcells = (powerout*parallel*series)/(irradiance*surface area*cellefficency)\n\nwhere:\n\n1. Irradiance is 1000 W/m2 as this the irradiance that panels are rated under\n\n2. Surface area: Is the surface area of the HBsurface\n\n\n\nFor the Sandia mode the area is automatically taken from the input panel.\n\n\n\nWarnings will be thrown if the calculated area that the cells cover is greater than 85% of the HBsurface\n\n\n\nI thought this would be cleaner than having to manually input the area, let me know if you are still confused or have any questions\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "August 7, 2016 at 2:44pm", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "parent_id": "topic_1574612", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578211"}
