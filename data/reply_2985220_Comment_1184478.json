{"body": "\nArtem,\n\nThe short answer is \"you can\" although the long answer is that it might not be the best way to model what you are testing in E+.\n\nThere is a component that allows you to make dynamic blinds and you can drop down the conductivity of the blinds and boost up their thickness to give them insulating properties. \u00a0The image below shows how to do this, dropping the conductivity down to 0.16 and boosting the thickness up to 5 cm:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/HkR0dixAlewinQ6c0GfkS1PBNO1dg73EmAwQfiKRGT55afzMJh9kJCzKP5FmjnW-8x47eI2*hy-8hEETHpEmqeqMlDnh9cnL/InsulatedBlinds.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/HkR0dixAlewinQ6c0GfkS1PBNO1dg73EmAwQfiKRGT55afzMJh9kJCzKP5FmjnW-8x47eI2*hy-8hEETHpEmqeqMlDnh9cnL/InsulatedBlinds.PNG)\n\nIf you know that airflow that you will get with Nat vent, you can set a custom airflow schedule.
