{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nthanks a lot for your help.\n\nI post here the difference between Honeybee and Dialux parameters.

In Dialux all of this information can be set before doing the daylight factor calculation.\n\nKind regards\n\nDavid\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1452630", "name": "Daylight factor honeybee.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1452631", "name": "daylight factor dialux.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "David Maimone", "created_at": "February 2, 2016 at 2:12am", "created_by": "DavidMaimone", "parent_id": "topic_1451916", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1452628"}
