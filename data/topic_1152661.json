{"body": "\nI second all folks here by thanking Mostapha and all for the outstanding work...\n\nI am working on Honeybee and EnergyPlus, and I have an issue.\u00a0\n\nI created a zone using surfaces, and it all works fine. However I need to set few surfaces as adiabatic (see the attachment).\u00a0\n\nWhen I run E-Plus simulation, it gives as warning that the surfaces are marked as Outdoor, which is a mistake. I've dug into the IDF log, and E-Plus override the settings for these surfaces.\n\n\n\nIs there a way to spec no Sun Exposure in Honeybee?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n-berardo\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1152660", "name": "Adiabatic.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Berardo Matalucci", "created_at": "October 20, 2014 at 4:40pm", "created_by": "BerardoMatalucci", "topic": "Honeybee + E-Plus - Surface Boundary settings", "id": "topic_1152661"}
