{"body": "\nHi Mostapha!\n\nAs I told you before, I'm experimenting with Honeybee. Right now specifically I am trying to create HB Zones from a Rhino model where all walls have different glazing ratios. I was able to do this for only 1 wall with the above solution, but then when I try to combine all walls to create a zone, nothing happens. I can upload a screenshot to see if you know whats wrong!\n\nThanks,[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LoK3NXOIwpGYPlTCQvLoQijdmkIM-kQMjfbDJFqjVo3w8mbCwnHVERveS6pjyWbiIVE-USt9BbnUSxN4kPB6QKwKh0Fu0vnO/Katrina.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/LoK3NXOIwpGYPlTCQvLoQijdmkIM-kQMjfbDJFqjVo3w8mbCwnHVERveS6pjyWbiIVE-USt9BbnUSxN4kPB6QKwKh0Fu0vnO/Katrina.png)\n\nkatrina\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Katrina Fernandez", "created_at": "April 30, 2014 at 10:22am", "created_by": "KatrinaFernandez", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1049215", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1062400"}
