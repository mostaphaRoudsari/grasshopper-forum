{"body": "\nAhhhhhhhh. That trick!! :-)\n\nThanks a lot. Now makes sense.\n\nWhatever you can do to ease the process will be blessed. Right now i'm using your definition, cause when i tried the insertion points is still not recognizing them. Sometimes i missed the exact location (not well aligned), but after fixing them (i think) ... no luck. For now i have to finish a presentation for class, but tomorrow i'll let my version a try.\n\n\n\nThanks again. This is awesome.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 16, 2017 at 01:15PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1672694", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1673249"}
