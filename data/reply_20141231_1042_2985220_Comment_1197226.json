{"body": "\nI have good news and bad news for you.\n\nThe good ones are that the geometry is fixed now and the simulation runs. You can understand from what i did what are the differences.\n\nThe bad news are that the IDF is indeed asking for surfaces report but the results are not reporting. Checking the CSV file i can see that the relevant columns name don't have the name of the zone so i suspect it is related.\n\nI also included updated component for the E+Run and results (grouped at the right) since they complain saying:\n\n1. Solution exception:'EPZone' object has no attribute 'natVent'\n\nI think i reported this one but i'm not sure i did, so ... here it is (maybe again). Unfortunately such an error don't allow the simulation to be done at all.\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1197228", "name": "MySimulation_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 31, 2014 at 10:42AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1197122", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1197226"}
