{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI was wondering if there is anyway we can make adjustments on the layout of a falsecolor image like number of steps on the legend between the maximum and minimum values, generating color bands instead of color lines and the location of the legend on the final layout of the image. All these options are available within the interface of wxfalsecolor software. However, I am looking for a component within the interface of grasshopper to allow me apply these changes for a given PIC file.\n\nIs there anyway to add such features through scripting to the Honeybee_falsecolor component?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alireza", "created_at": "April 10, 2014 at 09:07PM", "created_by": "Alireza", "topic": "Honeybee_Falsecolor", "id": "topic_1042518"}
