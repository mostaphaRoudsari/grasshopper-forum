{"body": "\nDear djordje<br/> <br/> Thank you very much for your detailed explanation it really helps to save lot of time. I have tested couple of simulations according to the **context_** input.\n\nI have noticed that daylight simulation runDaylightAnalyis havs a **_HBObjects** input which directly take other geometries thus it influences the daylighting results (tested).\n\nThen, I have tried to connect as you sketched on the grasshopper definition, however it shows the error of recursive function. Which makes me think that I have to internalize the data output from ACenergyPerHour instead of directly connect ot **ACenergyPerHour_** on SunpathShading as well as the **annualShading** to **annualShading** on DCtoACderateFactor (image). Please correct me if I am wrong about connecting these three components.\n\n<br/> If I need to internalize the data from each generation, what would be ideal algorithm to deal with it when I do Galapagos or other GA? (maybe couple of rec component with Boolean toggle on dispatch component) Because as you expect now, I am parametrically changing the fa\u00e7ade geometry and in every generated instances should be take an account of shading from upper floor of the fa\u00e7ade geometries to get realistic data from PV surface electricity generation.\n\n[Image upload is not working, click here to see the screenshot.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1smhkvohdcuecio/Recursive%20connection%20error.png?dl=0)<br/> I hope you understand what I have written above. <br/> <br/> Kind regards.<br/> Amaraa\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "May 24, 2016 at 01:19PM", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1534991", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1535895"}
