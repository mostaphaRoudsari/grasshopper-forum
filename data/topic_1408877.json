{"body": "\nHi guys!\n\n\n\nI've been going through the forums to see if this has been raised, and have been looking at other examples of this component, but unable to solve my issue. Apologies if it is a very simple one!\n\n\n\nThe component Microclimate Map Analysis will not read the comfort recipe from the Adaptive Comfort Analysis Recipe nor the PMV recipe, as illustrated below. The error says \"Comfort recipe not recognised\". All my objects have been updated via the updater...\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vJ2j3JoNjkHha8HQNzM8VonXJbRIGSP3wpfkLIoBrSHQKTmY3McvhDqnS8ctK1Vf33MYIbOdehFXpCDu5nTc8QdzSWYy19Na/Screenshot2015112516.34.53.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vJ2j3JoNjkHha8HQNzM8VonXJbRIGSP3wpfkLIoBrSHQKTmY3McvhDqnS8ctK1Vf33MYIbOdehFXpCDu5nTc8QdzSWYy19Na/Screenshot2015112516.34.53.png)\n\n\n\nAm not sure if this is simply due to an error in code, or if I am missing a fundamental step.\n\n\n\nHelp!\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1408876", "name": "ExampleFile_V1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "November 24, 2015 at 8:42pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Unrecognised Comfort Recipe - Microclimate Map Analysis", "id": "topic_1408877"}
