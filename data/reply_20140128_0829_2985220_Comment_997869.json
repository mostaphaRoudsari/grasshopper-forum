{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThanks again for keeping me posted. \u00a0The issue that you are having seems to be pretty minor. \u00a0It looks like you are getting the right result out of the component and the component is just having difficulty cleaning up after itself. \u00a0I was not able to reproduce your problem with the GH file that you sent me (it's working fine for a bunch of weather files that I have tried in you GH file). \u00a0What epw file are you using with Ladybug to generate the solar vectors?\n\n\n\nAlso, could you let me know if the attached version of your GH file fixes the problem (I just put in another check that helps the component clean up after itself)?\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A997870", "name": "solarFan_solarEnvelopeViewFromSun_For Abraham.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 28, 2014 at 08:29AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_969681", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_997869"}
