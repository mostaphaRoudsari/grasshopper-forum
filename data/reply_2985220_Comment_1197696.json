{"body": "\nwhen i run simulation just a one zone, is it\u00a0necessary\u00a0to\u00a0 pay attention to adjacency\n\nNo.\n\n\n\nIt gives you the error since the analysis fails to run. There are couple of mistakes that you are making here and there in the file. I suggest you to use panel and check the inputs and outputs in all the steps.\n\nWhen you put the surfaces together you need to have them in the same branch. In your case you can just flatten the input. The output of createHBZones should be a list of closedBreps.\n\nWhen you are using panel to name the surfaces/zones do NOT press enter after writing the name. We can add an extra check for this but in any case you should not have an extra line when you name surfaces/zones.\n\n\n\nThe components which are changed are grouped so you can see the changes.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1197698", "name": "forBEgan3_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 2, 2015 at 6:02pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1197685", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1197696"}
