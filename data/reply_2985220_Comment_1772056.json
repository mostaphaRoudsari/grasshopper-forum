{"body": "\nThis is an interesting question. You don't need to use Galapagos for this as there are analytical approaches to find the volume. Here is one approach that you can use the solve the problem.\n\n\n\n1. Create the maximum volume that you can extrude.\n\n2. Find the problematic area on your surface ([check this example on Hydra](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&amp;fork=hydra_1&amp;id=Central_Park_Shadow_Study&amp;slide=2&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)).\n\n3. Break down the volume into smaller pieces or a grid.\n\n4. Shoot back the sun-rays from the points and find how many of rays are block by each piece.\n\n5. Sort them based on the damage that they make and start removing from the most problematic ones.\n\n6. At some point you'll find the minimum number of cells that you need to remove to get your target number of hours for all the points on the surface.\n\n\n\nThis might be a little bit hard for a beginner to put together though. Give it a try and let us know if you can't figure it out yourself.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 20, 2017 at 3:18pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1772025", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1772056"}
