{"body": "Hi Laurent. What version of ladybug are you using? We just updated the sun position function a couple of months ago to reflect sun positions for the year 2014. The new function is much more accurate for the current year and the previous one was off by ~2 degrees sometimes. We have verified the new function against the NOAA database.
