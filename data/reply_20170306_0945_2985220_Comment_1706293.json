{"body": "\nHi Duncan,\n\n\n\nThank you for your quick reply.\n\n\n\nI do have a follow up question. When you say 329 times do you mean 329 hours of the 744 possible hours?\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo the 329 times would be a total of 44% of the time in June? Is this correct?\u00a0\n\n\n\nI want to make sure I can understand this correctly so that I may use ladybug and honeybee in the best possible way.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you again!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "March 06, 2017 at 09:45AM", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1706165", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1706293"}
