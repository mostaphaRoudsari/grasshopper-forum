{"body": "\nHi Jason,\n\nThe equation for UTCI calculation is one enormous, 200-term polynomial approximation across all of the data points that were used to derive it. \u00a0The version of the UTCI equation in Ladybug is a direct python translation from the original FORTRAN code published on the UTCI website:\n\n[http://www.utci.org/utci_doku.php](http://www.utci.org/utci_doku.php)\n\n(you can find it by clicking on \"UTCI_Program_Code\" and then downloading the \"UTCI_a002.f90\" and opening it in the text editor of your choice).\n\n\n\nFor the python function that calculates UTCI in Ladybug, you can find it here:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/ladybug...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/ladybug_ladybug.py#L3305-L3582)\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 30, 2015 at 8:27pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1315678", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1318360"}
