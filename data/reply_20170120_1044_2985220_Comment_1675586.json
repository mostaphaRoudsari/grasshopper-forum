{"body": "\nHi Julia,\n\n\n\nThank you for your input !\n\nThis is approximately the way I am doing it right now but it requires quite a few unit conversions before having the right input and therefore higher risk of making a mistake..\n\nIn was therefore wondering if there was a nicer way to do it using the inputs already existing in the different components :)\n\n\n\nPS : This workflow is quite useful to modify a schedule !
