{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\n\n\nIt is what I was guessing.\n\nI'm using the outdoor microclimate map and comparing it with the shadow mask and solar radiation as I am trying to optimise a terrace heavily obstructed by skyscrapers for outdoor comfort during the lunchtime.\n\nI don't really mind if the component uses one time or the other, but, as my time period is so tight, I need to know which one are they using to adjust properly the analysis period and that all of them use the same one to have an accurate guessing of the main targets.\n\n\n\nI guess Ill have to analyse 12-14 during winter time and 11-13 during summer.\n\n\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nJulia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julia T", "created_at": "February 09, 2017 at 04:03AM", "created_by": "JuliaT", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1688179", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1688321"}
