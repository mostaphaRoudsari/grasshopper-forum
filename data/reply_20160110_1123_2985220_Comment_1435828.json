{"body": "\nHey Chris and Mostapha,\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for taking a look at this! I attached an image of the error message. I noticed that the version which gives me the error is VER 0.0.58 NOV_7_2015, whilst the one Chris uses is NOV_20_2015. The difference seems to be the way the EPContext component interprets the surface. The newer version doesn't seem to triangulate. Great news! Thanks again!\n\n\n\n/Amanda\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1435829", "name": "severe error.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1435830", "name": "HBContext output.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Amanda O'Donnell", "created_at": "January 10, 2016 at 11:23AM", "created_by": "AmandaODonnell", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435243", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435828"}
