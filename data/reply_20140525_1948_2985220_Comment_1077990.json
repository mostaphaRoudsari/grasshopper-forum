{"body": "\nHi Jack,\n\nIt's not just you. I am also able to replicate the problem. It seems to crash in the following case:\n\n1) Open the tutorial file that has the EmbryoViz graph already placed. The graph component should not be connected to anything.\n\n2) Connect some null data to the graph. The component crashes as shown.\n\n2b) Alternatively, connect a list of numbers to the graph. The component does not crash, but remains grey and fails to generate the graph.\n\nInterestingly, the component doesn't crash if you start a new canvas, add the graph component, save, reload the canvas and repeat the steps above.\u00a0\n\nAlso, the component doesn't crash if you add your own copy of the graph component to GH and then feed data into it. See my attached file - the component on the right I added myself.\n\nSo I'm not exactly sure what the problem is - it isn't exclusively a problem with EmbryoViz, but likely some kind of clash between HoneyBee and EmbryoViz. May be worth contacting John Harding (creator of EmbryoViz).\n\nIn the meantime, when you load the tutorial file, just delete and re-add the graph component from the canvas.\n\nJames\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1077992", "name": "20140526 embryoviz crash.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1077993", "name": "20140526 embryoviz crash 2.png"}], "created_by_name": "James Ramsden", "created_at": "May 25, 2014 at 07:48PM", "created_by": "JamesRamsden", "parent_id": "topic_1078232", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1077990"}
