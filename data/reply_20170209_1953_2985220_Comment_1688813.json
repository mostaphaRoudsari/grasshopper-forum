{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI did notice the input was missing in the updated versions, I ended up using the one you had for us before the alteration purely so I could get some indicative images to use in a memo to demonstrate only on a visual basis the differences.\n\nI moved to using Honeybee's Radiance analysis, but was stumped when I was faced with the issue of getting hourly results from it =/ (I needed to provide our CFD modeller the radiation values for the measurement points so they could do an outdoor thermal comfort study) I couldn't find any components which would allow me to grab hourly radiation outputs, so instead, I set up a parametric model to simulate a grid analysis (whereby the hours in the skyfile were parametrically changes) and put the simulation type to Radiation, set it to record the results into an excel sheet, and then produced a macro to combine all the data 500 simulated results into one spread sheet..\n\nIt was a bit of a loop, but we got there in the end!!\n\nCould I perhaps request a means to grab hourly radiation data from the Radiance simulation? It is very simple to grab illuminance, but for the life of me I couldn't find the radiation files =(\n\n\n\n- Elly\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "February 09, 2017 at 07:53PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1688507", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1688813"}
