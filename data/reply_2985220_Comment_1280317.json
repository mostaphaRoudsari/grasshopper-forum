{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you so much for the detail explanation! It helps a lot!\u00a0\n\nAs Abraham mentioned above, I think what I should do is to take the COP into account before adding the\u00a0thermal loads (Heating, Cooling) to the electrical energy (lighting, equipment), in order to calculate the amount of\u00a0electricity required for the predicted\u00a0thermal loads (Heating, Cooling), which depends on the selected energy source and the COP.\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "May 4, 2015 at 10:49am", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280173", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280317"}
