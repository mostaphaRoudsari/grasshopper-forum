{"body": "\nHi doompop!\n\nGreat to know that you liked Ladybug.\u00a0I added Vertical Sky Component as a [wish](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/30). I believe that\u00a0Vertical Sky Components next to Sunlight hours will enhance Ladybug capabilities for planning purposes.\u00a0Time-wise though I'll be concentrated on developing Honeybee to the point that it can be shared for test, then I'll optimize current analysis components and add new ones like Vertical Sky Component. Thank you for the great suggestion!\n\nBest,\n\n-Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 18, 2013 at 5:25pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_811691", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_812013"}
