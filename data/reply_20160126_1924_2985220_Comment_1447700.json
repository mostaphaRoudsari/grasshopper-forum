{"body": "\nHi Theodoros,\n\n\n\nI myself am interested in using pollination to have a look at my results but cannot for the life of me understand how the component works to set out all the data. I am using the parametric slider \"Ladybug_fly!\" to generate some idf files, and the batch writer to create batches to run in parallel. However, bringing the data back in and then using pollination to summarise it all is slipping past me for whatever reason.\n\n\n\nAre you able to provide your file for me to see how you have done it, or go over my own and show me how it should be done?\n\n\n\nKind Regards\n\nElly\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1447702", "name": "Workflow_Forum.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 26, 2016 at 07:24PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447957", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1447700"}
