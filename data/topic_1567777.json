{"body": "\nI love the auto-zoning feature in HB which generates floors and perimeter zones for you. It works well for towers. Now I am trying to figure out how to assign daysim dimming schedules I generated for a single floor, 5 zone model, to the North, East, West and South zones of the tower without having to list out each zone on each exposure and pass it through a schedules assignment component. Any efficiencies here? Many thanks again.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Arpan Bakshi", "created_at": "July 18, 2016 at 11:07am", "created_by": "ArpanBakshi", "topic": "Custom schedules for towers", "id": "topic_1567777"}
