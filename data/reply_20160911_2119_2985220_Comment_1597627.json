{"body": "Ji,\n\nI admittedly got a bit overzealous in my desire to transition people over to the OpenStudio component and my hope that Anton would be able to apply the HBGenerator capabilities on the OpenStudio component quickly. I think that the OpenStudio API has everything that we need but, if not, there is a class inside the OS component for writing features not in OS into the Idf that could take care of it.\n\n\nI just took out everything because I didn't want to create a precedent for two divergent streams of development between the E+ and OpenStudio components. I also wanted to be able to say that this past release had the same capabilities implemented on both components. I'll add back the generator outputs on the Generate EP Output component soon.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 11, 2016 at 09:19PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1597206", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1597627"}
