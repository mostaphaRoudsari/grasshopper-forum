{"body": "\nHi Brian,\n\nEverything looks good in your text file. \u00a0I can't think of anything else that should be added to it right now. \u00a0There's a chance that there might be a few more OpenStudio things that would need to be installed to run the OpenStudio component in the future but I would not worry about it for now\u00a0([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/214#issuecommen...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/214#issuecomment-61433209)).\n\nAh. \u00a0You are right about the southern hemisphere thing. \u00a0I know that the solution seems a lot less elegant now and the most elegant one that I can think of would be to write it all into a python component. \u00a0I am currently working with a nat vent expert who is helping me define natural ventilation schedules for E+ and I will be sure to include the nat vent period as an output from this so that you can make this definition more elegant in the future. \u00a0I will let you know when I have to component together.\n\nAlso, all Ladybug components and the EnergyPlus simulation should still be able to deal with that reversed analysis period and let me know if you find otherwise for some reason.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 04, 2014 at 10:48PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1161883", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1162022"}
