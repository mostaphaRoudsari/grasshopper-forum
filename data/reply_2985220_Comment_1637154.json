{"body": "\nHi Ernst,\n\nI don't think there is a single answer to this question. It depends on the type of the analysis you are trying to run.\n\nGenerally speaking the more RAM you have the better. Specially when it comes to butterfly/CFD/OpenFOAM you want to make sure you have enough memory for snappyHexMesh.\n\nBoth Radiance and OpenFoam can take advantage of parallel runs in non-Windows environments. Currently OpenFoam is using dockers to run OpenFOAM from Windows which is what Butterfly is using so you can run the analysis in Parallel even from Windows. In both cases having more cpus will decrease the time of the analysis.\n\nHere is two benchmarking tests for Radiance: [1](https://github.com/markstock/Radiance-Benchmark4)\u00a0and [2](http://markjstock.org/pages/rad_bench_old.html), and [here is benchmarking test](http://www.jeplus.org/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:eplustest)\u00a0for EnergyPlus. You can find it both for the computer speed and processor speed.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 10, 2016 at 4:50pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1632690", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1637154"}
