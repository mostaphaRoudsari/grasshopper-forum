{"body": "\nHi Dan,\n\nThe last image shows you don't have full access to the folder.\n\nWhat is interesting in your case is that half of the images is produced. Have you tried to close and re-open the file?\n\nI haven't updated the example files but this is solved in newer version of Honeybee by using an alternate folder. I think this is about the time to make to release a newer version.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 14, 2014 at 05:55PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1101605", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1101967"}
