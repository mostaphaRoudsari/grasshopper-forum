{"body": "Theodore,\nAs in the unmethours post, you have to hard size everything in honeybee that is normally autosized before you can turn off the \"run sizing calculation\" option. What type of HVAC are you running? We haven't exposed the ability to hard size everything on Honeybee yet but we might be able to do so fairly quickly if you are only running an ideal air system. You will also have to come up with a pre-determined capacity for this system in Watts before you can set this as the hard sized value.\n\nIn addition to that, there may be other oddities of OpenStudio that we have to work around mentioned in the unmethours post but I know we'll find a way to address them by post processing the IDF if OpenStudio doesn't allow us to do it on its own.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 08, 2016 at 05:51AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1653181", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1654260"}
