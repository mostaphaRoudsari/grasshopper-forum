{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Anton,\n\n\n\nI am curious. Is it difficult to do a ghenv.Component.AddRuntimeMessage type thing if we know what classes to anticipate as inputs and instances of those classes aren't provided as inputs? I think grasshopper already does it for basic type like int,str etc. I was wondering if it is possible to do so for custom classes as well.\n\n\n\nSarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 04, 2016 at 10:14PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1523097", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1523268"}
