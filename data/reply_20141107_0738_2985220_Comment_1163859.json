{"body": "\nThanks! This was very helpful. your video helped me understand why i kept getting the conditional statements wrong.<br/><br/>I do have a small follow up question out of curiosity though.<br/><br/>If i would want to calculate what wind directions that lead to the most heatloss i would have to calculate a wind chill effect neglecting the RH. Temperature, air specific heat, wind speed and heating degree hours all in one equation. Is this doable? Is it relevant? It would lead to a windrose that is very graphic and easy to understand i think.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ludvig Haav", "created_at": "November 07, 2014 at 07:38AM", "created_by": "LudvigNyman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1162864", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163859"}
