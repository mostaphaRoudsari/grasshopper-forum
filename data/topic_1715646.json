{"body": "\nI am modelling multiple buildings (67 in total) in Rhino and I am having error for some of them, in particular a few buildings that are titled in a certain angle (most of them are shoeboxes with 0 degrees).\n\n\n\nThe following error appears, when simulating on EnergyPlus, after creating the geometry with Honeybee and Grasshopper:<br/><br/>** Severe ** checkSubSurfAzTiltNorm: Outward facing angle of subsurface differs more than 90.0 degrees from base surface.<br/>** ~~~ ** Subsurface=\"RETAIL_SRF_3_GLZ_0_GLZP_0\" Tilt = 90.0 Azimuth = 262.8<br/>** ~~~ ** Base surface=\"RETAIL_SRF_3\" Tilt = 90.9 Azimuth = 61.8\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially I created the geometry for this buildings by creating polylines from lower left corner, turned into a surface and extruded. secondly, I copied from a zero degree shoebox and tilted it, and finally I copied one of the tilted building that was working to use as base for the ones that were giving the error. None of these approaches seems to solve the error. Any ideas of what to do?<br/><br/>PS: If it is not clear, I can submit some images to illustrate or ask permission to see if I can share the model.<br/><br/>Thank you!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Luis Santos", "created_at": "March 19, 2017 at 6:50am", "created_by": "LuisSantos", "topic": "error (tilted surfaces)", "id": "topic_1715646"}
