{"body": "\nHi,\n\nIt's been a while since i asked this ...\n\nIn the meantime i've found this [discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/interzone-airflow-rate-for-a-large-volume). From that and from seeing the HB_setEPNatVent interZoneAirFlowRate_ input it is correct to say that the calculation is 0.0963 multiplied for the area of the air wall? With this the numbers fit, but just want to be sure.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 9, 2017 at 1:11pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1680018", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1688304"}
