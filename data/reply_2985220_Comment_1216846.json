{"body": "\nDimitrios,\n\nThis is quite an an unusual bug that affects the very rare case that you end the name of your zone with a space (as you did when you called your third zone \"zone3 \"). \u00a0It seems that EnergyPlus automatically cuts this space out of the name when it runs and this causes the name to not be matched up with the original HBZone. \u00a0I have put in a check that fixes this case with the color zones component but I realize that this won't fix all of them (like color surfaces and the comfort map workflow). \u00a0In the future, we really need to give a warning if you input a zone or surface name ending or starting with a space and, for now, it's probably a good idea to not end the names of your surfaces or zones with a blank space.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1216848", "name": "Annual_Loads_Housing_01_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 3, 2015 at 4:56pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1216920", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1216846"}
