{"body": "\nMostapha, hello. I may be running into this same issue at the moment: the setHBZoneConstr function isn't able to pull the window construction from the library. I tried sync'ing for the most up-to-date version of LB/HB, and doing the whole quit-restart rain dance, but no success yet. I suppose the work around for the moment is, don't change the window construction! not a huge deal, I can get at it in the idf. But if you have any suggestions, let me know.\u00a0\n\nThanks!\n\nNick.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/vZBStZ816j1gLg4isv8Mqvu4*doPat0qp0LtPQFgjIUWEPP8nu8vI0t6krqnPfdmPfEKBQnPr5RfWapPIb1tkvOnzGTwmvOq/Clipboard01.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/vZBStZ816j1gLg4isv8Mqvu4*doPat0qp0LtPQFgjIUWEPP8nu8vI0t6krqnPfdmPfEKBQnPr5RfWapPIb1tkvOnzGTwmvOq/Clipboard01.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Novelli", "created_at": "July 16, 2015 at 2:16am", "created_by": "NickNovelli", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1260033", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1326605"}
