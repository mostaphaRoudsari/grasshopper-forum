{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nIt is not that easy since Masoome needs to both create this\u00a0WindowMaterial:Blind:EquivalentLayer and put a Shading Control object into the IDF to say when the blinds are pulled. \u00a0This\u00a0shading\u00a0control must be applied to the EPFenSrf that has\u00a0the blind layer in it. \u00a0I am not so sure of the best way to implement this since our\u00a0traditional\u00a0method of simply making the material will not solve the whole issue of writing both\u00a0the shading control object and the material layer into the IDF.\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions on how you might want it implemented.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 6, 2014 at 5:56pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182565", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182574"}
