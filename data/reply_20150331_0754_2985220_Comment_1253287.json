{"body": "\nNita,\n\nAs I understand it, Galapagos requires a single number input to guide the\u00a0optimization. The trick is developing a fitness function that balances the multiple objective parameters into one value. I have found that this is tough because energy , glare, view quality, daylight autonomy and aesthetics cannot be directly compared. How many units of view are worth a 10% reduction in energy? Somewhere along the line the user needs to make a subjective call on how to balance these objectives, which throws off the accuracy of any optimization.\n\nAs far as the GH code in concerned, I think you would needs to weigh each objective with coefficients and sum them into one final number. This would be a custom script that normalizes all outputs, multiplies by a weighting factor, then sums them all together.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI'm curious how others\u00a0get past\u00a0the inability of optimization scripts to truly balance dissimilar objectives. I think the solution lies in avoiding optimization altogether. I ran into the idea of Pareto efficiencies while exploring a similar question. Take a look here:\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency)\n\nIf you iterate through a variety of options (possibly using Galapagos to\u00a0run\u00a0fewer options)\u00a0and then review the entire landscape of solutions, you may be able to find\u00a0a Pareto frontier\u00a0that identifies\u00a0many solutions that maximize most of your objectives. You can also use something like Pollinator to better navigate the solution landscape.\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/new-develop...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/new-development-pollination-for-exploring-multi-dimensional-data)\n\n\u00a0\n\nI've struggled with this issue for a while and was hoping someone would have a better answer. I'm all ears.\n\n-Leland\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "March 31, 2015 at 07:54AM", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "topic_1253437", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1253287"}
