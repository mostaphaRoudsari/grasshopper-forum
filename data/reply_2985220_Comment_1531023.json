{"body": "\nDjordje and Aymeric,\n\n\n\nI have finished going through all of the components and example files and I think it is safe to say now that the bug has been squashed. \u00a0I can also confirm that all of the difference between the Thermal Comfort Indices component and the Solar Adjusted Temperature component has to do with the amount of shortwave radiation falling on the occupant (the long wave radiation balances are matching well). \u00a0Djordje, I think that the use of the globalHorizontalRaditiaion formula instead of the one that separates direct and diffuse radiation might be causing the thermal comfort indices component to underestimate the amount of shortwave radiation on the occupant by a small amount. \u00a0This said, the occupant geometry can influence the amount of shortwave radiation so much that I think this underestimation is fine given all of these typical unknowns of occupant geometry.\n\n\n\nJust to summarize all of the example files that have been updated with the fixing of this bug, they are as follows:\n\n[Outdoor Microclimate Map](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Outdoor_Microclimate_Map&amp;slide=1&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n[Trees in Outdoor Comfort](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Trees_in_Outdoor_Thermal_Comfort&amp;slide=1&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n[Simple Spatial UTCI](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Urban_Microclimate_-_Simple_Spatial_UTCI&amp;slide=1&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n[Microclimate Map Simple](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Microclimate_Map_-_Simple&amp;slide=1&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n[Outdoor Comfort Shade Benefit](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Outdoor_Comfort_Shade_Benefit&amp;slide=1&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n[Accounting for Solar Radiation in Comfort](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Accounting_for_Solar_Radiation_in_Comfort&amp;slide=1&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\nThanks again, Djordje and Aymeric, for bringing this issue to the forefront.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 15, 2016 at 9:56pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1530676", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1531023"}
