{"body": "\nHi Alejandro, Output of DecomposeZone is a Grasshopper geometry and not a Honeybee object, so when you connect it to runDaylightAnalysis component it won't be exported to rad file. I used importRAD to import the file back and see what is going on. As you can see only shading surface gets exported.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KzOvBNTGFEGlXg7Y27-HSwl*fFiVLo1q638tLsDw1jTXGzXztmHlAaJGDj8fNTaJ6v9PEZP*xOnFjpaDDuPqotw*63-Brfkh/HBObjects.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KzOvBNTGFEGlXg7Y27-HSwl*fFiVLo1q638tLsDw1jTXGzXztmHlAaJGDj8fNTaJ6v9PEZP*xOnFjpaDDuPqotw*63-Brfkh/HBObjects.png)\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\nPS: I understand that it may make more sense to change outputs of DecomposeZoneBasedOnType to be HBSurfaces and not Breps. Your current workflow should have worked.
