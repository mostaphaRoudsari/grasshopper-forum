{"body": "\nHi Mostapha. Has this been implemented yet? I'm in the process of updating my scripts. Ladybug version 0.65 doesn't appear to have been updated based on this discussion.\n\n\n\nWhen you say ladybugX do you mean Ladybug/Honeybee Plus? I've tried this but am getting an error.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/x9EqstmaUHnYL8nTKpzBYYkyNtzYSfa*feoZXc0GKkFooFUDVEQt7AvhQUZxZd0ymECDXuFnP-WqBgNdghZPThG2Y3LlCDcY/2017090516_13_20Grasshopper170822SEPP65analysispreliminary_Plus_version0_1_.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/x9EqstmaUHnYL8nTKpzBYYkyNtzYSfa*feoZXc0GKkFooFUDVEQt7AvhQUZxZd0ymECDXuFnP-WqBgNdghZPThG2Y3LlCDcY/2017090516_13_20Grasshopper170822SEPP65analysispreliminary_Plus_version0_1_.png)\n\n\n\nAlso I understand a lot of the Ladybug components have been moved into Honeybee Plus. If I use Ladybug/Honeybee Plus which components do I need to use to replace the 'SunlightHoursAnalysis' component found in the legacy Ladybug? I'm guessing I will need to use test points instead of geometry (mesh or brep) and that other users will need to install Radiance. Is there a benefit in using the Plus version if I am just using Ladybug and not Honeybee?\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul Wintour", "created_at": "September 05, 2017 at 12:21AM", "created_by": "PaulWintour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1585714", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1808771"}
