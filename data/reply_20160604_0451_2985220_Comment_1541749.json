{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nonce again I have problems with the model. I made changes in order to solve it but it doesn't work anyway. I also created a smaller model following exactly the same way to test if I was wrong while creating it. The second model works properly. But I don't understand why the first one doesn't work. And now it is crashing, not freezing.\n\nI attach both models.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEduard\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1541750", "name": "FIRST MODEL READY_THESIS.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1541751", "name": "SECOND MODEL READY_THESIS.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Eduard Nunez", "created_at": "June 04, 2016 at 04:51AM", "created_by": "EduardNunez", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1540815", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1541749"}
