{"body": "\nI'm currently doing a lot of daylight and radiation simulations with Honeybee and Ladybug, but I keep running in to the same problem multiple times:\n\n\n\nHow can I implement/define loose elements in a zone to get a realistic daylight simulation?\n\n\n\nFor example: What if a room has a small wall or element in the middle that does not cut it into two zones but does take away light in the space behind? How does Honeybee allow this element to be taken into account for daylight simulation?\n\nOther example: What if you have a 6 storey Atrium, with one walkbridge in the middle that decreases the amount of Lux underneath but does not cut the atrium into separate zones?\n\nWhere should I add such a surface in my GH-HB definition?\n\n\n\nHope someone can help\n\n\n\nGreetz!!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dwayne van Halewijn", "created_at": "December 08, 2015 at 03:39AM", "created_by": "DwaynevanHalewijn", "topic": "Shading Elements within Honeybee Zones", "id": "topic_1417072"}
