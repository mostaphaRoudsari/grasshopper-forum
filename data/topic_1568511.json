{"body": "\nDear \u00a0all,\n\nI am trying to find optimum tilt angle with ladybug by using TOF component.\n\nis it necessary\u00a0to know what is inside the TOF and which formulas are used for estimating total annual solar radiation as well as the\u00a0optimum tilt angle. But the problems\u00a0are the formula inside the TOF. EPW gives us 8760 hours data file that feeds into the diffuse and direct and ground-reflect solar radiation. but, it is not clear that we used all 8760 hours data or average the data for a whole year or....?\n\nand second questions is there is no any azimuth parameter inside the formulas. And how mesh is created without considering any azimuth parameter (see picture below).\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pBewlkvOZIi0VZBN1ryto3rNKN9mV0UlS6nha5ez8I8-QF8qJt95n-DMAtKhS3Vy01bwaPA6SfY0-wxQquUOjkH4f6*2Pe5h/5.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pBewlkvOZIi0VZBN1ryto3rNKN9mV0UlS6nha5ez8I8-QF8qJt95n-DMAtKhS3Vy01bwaPA6SfY0-wxQquUOjkH4f6*2Pe5h/5.png)\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hamid", "created_at": "July 19, 2016 at 7:31am", "created_by": "Hamid549", "topic": "TOF algorithm", "id": "topic_1568511"}
