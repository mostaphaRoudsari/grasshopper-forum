{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nSorry to revive such an old post but I was wondering if you could shed some lights to the considerations in how we put together a complicated model with many zones.\n\n\n\nI am trying to run a 121 zone building but I keep running out of memory (pc just never writes the .idf file). My computer is quite strong so I am wondering if I'm doing something else wrong.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 04:03AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1224015", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1277430"}
