{"body": "\nHello All,\n\nI am having issues running the energy analysis with blinds. I have tried to use the regular output (HBObjWShades) or the shades breps\u00a0as context. In both cases, the energy analysis doesn't run. When I run the analysis using the\u00a0HBObjWShades output, I get two errors, showed in the attached picture (UsingOutput). On the\u00a0other hand, when I try to use the shdesbrep\u00a0output as context for the analysis, it gives me the error in the attached image (UsingContext). I have no idea how to fix these issues, I have tried to generate my own shade material based on Energy Plus documentation.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for the help in Advance,\u00a0\n\n\n\nJP\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1573955", "name": "EnergyAnalysisMultipleZones2.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1573956", "name": "UsingOutput.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1573957", "name": "UsingContext.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Joao Pedro Carneiro", "created_at": "July 31, 2016 at 03:13PM", "created_by": "JoaoPedroCarneiro", "topic": "Blinds Issue", "id": "topic_1573958"}
