{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\nI'm not sure if there is a different HVAC Availability schedule based on program types. As you can see the availability schedule is set to Always On which means whenever that zone needs cooling or heating the HVAC will be available.\u00a0In this case system will be used based on set-points and not the schedule. You can plot cooling loads and heating loads and any hour that the loads are not 0 it means the system has been on.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 28, 2015 at 2:06am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1349911", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1350194"}
