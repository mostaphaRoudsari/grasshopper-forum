{"body": "\nHi Guys,<br/><br/>My goal is to get information about the lighting in a room from arduino sensors and simulate the radiation in grasshopper to optimize an experimental freeform.<br/><br/>I was wondering if there is a way in Ladybug/Honeybee to set the light source manually? So without a certain \"analysis period\" looking for the right position of the sun in the .epw file.<br/><br/>Or is there maybe a better grasshopper plugin for this task?<br/><br/>thank you, Julian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julian Jauk", "created_at": "April 01, 2017 at 02:55PM", "created_by": "JulianJauk", "topic": "Ladybug - set Sun/Light Source manually", "id": "topic_1725208"}
