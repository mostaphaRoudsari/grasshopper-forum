{"body": "\nDevang,\n\nThank you, this is really useful!\n\nI have another question (hope not to bother you). I'm trying to run the daylight analysis as said before. For what concern the daylight analysis everything seems to work properly but when I'm trying to calculate the SunLightAnalysis and the ViewAnalysis inside my classroom, the result is always zero. Do you have any idea of why is that? Is it because these component work only for the outdoor? It seems that the window is not recognize.\n\nI don't know if I was clear enough, so I've attached the gh file on which I'm working on.\n\n\n\nThank you again for your time,\n\nCarlie\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1672358", "name": "Daylight_analysis_CS.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Carlie_3", "created_at": "January 15, 2017 at 11:05AM", "created_by": "Carlie_3", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1672451", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1672357"}
