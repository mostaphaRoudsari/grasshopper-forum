{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nSorry for the confusion with that. \u00a0I had changed the internal method used by the component but not the input description. \u00a0I have just changed it to the following, which correctly descibes what you should input:\n\n\n\n_temperatures: A stream of 8760 temperature values representing temperature at each hour of the year that will be used to evaluate shade benefit. \u00a0This can be the dryBulbTemperature from the 'Import EPW' component, the univeralThermalClimateIndex (UTCI) output from the 'Outdoor Comfort Calculator' component, or the standardEffectiveTemperature (SET) output from the 'PMV Comfort Calculator' component. \u00a0If you are using this component to evaluate shade for a passive building with no heating/cooling, this input can also be the indoor temperature of the zone to be shaded.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 10, 2015 at 4:20pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1239873", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240079"}
