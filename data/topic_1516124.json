{"body": "\nHi dears,<br/> I have some problems in Therm component. First of all I wanted to calculate heat transfer rate for a profile section but therm components couldn't export the real shape to therm software and I faced some errors in grasshopper algorithm. I tried a simpler form to make sure the algorithm works, it did but not with my profile section. I really appreciate if you could guide me how to fix this.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoreover, I couldn't import window glazing text file in to grasshopper. Actually window save the file and I define the path but the component shows an error: \"1. Solution exception:invalid literal for float(): y 10.0 S\"\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "s.ali", "created_at": "April 25, 2016 at 3:31am", "created_by": "seyedali", "topic": "Therm", "id": "topic_1516124"}
