{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nFolks I am confused.\u00a0 Please help clarify what is the difference between the 'Sunlight hour analysis' done via LB vs 'Shadow range study' done using HB/ Radiance.\n\n\n\nOn Hydra I found a\u00a0'Sunlight hour analysis' script which uses a LB component. (see screen capture 1 below).\u00a0 This gave me a wonderful butterfly diagram so I can explain how many hours of sunlight the street or plaza etc will get.\u00a0 (see screen capture 2 below)\n\n\n\nNext on Hydra I found the 'Shadow range study' which uses HB (see screen capture 3 below).\u00a0 I saw a you tube video where Mostapha showed how to run this script (see screen capture 4 below).\u00a0 I was able to run the script and get a HDR image.\n\n\n\nMy question is what is the difference between these two?\u00a0 Can I extract any sunlight/ shadow values from the HB HDR image or is this just a pretty looking visual?\u00a0 I mean how is this informing my design?\u00a0 What should I learn from it.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1755929", "name": "Capture1.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1755930", "name": "Capture2.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1755931", "name": "Capture3.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Ibby", "created_at": "May 22, 2017 at 11:53am", "created_by": "Ibby", "topic": "Sunlight hour analysi LB vs Shadow range study HB", "id": "topic_1755932"}
