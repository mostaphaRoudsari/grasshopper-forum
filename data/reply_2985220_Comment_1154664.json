{"body": "\nAh yes! \u00a0That was a bug in the 'LabelZone Surface'\u00a0component that I wrote and I am sorry for that. \u00a0I was trying to save the user time by copying the data of the zones to memory (if the input geometry did not change) since recalling the honeybee zones from the hive can be a lengthy process of several seconds. \u00a0However, I later realized that this would cause the component to not update if the user made a change to the zones upstream of the component and the input zone geometry did not change. \u00a0Needless to say, I have since fixed the error and I now recall the honeybee sones each time an input to the LabelZones component changes. \u00a0So, if you sync with our github by using the \"Update Honeybee\" component, you should see that the new 'LabelZone Surface'\u00a0component\u00a0will not give you that delay.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 23, 2014 at 8:09pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1153187", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1154664"}
