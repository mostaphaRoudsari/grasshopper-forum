{"body": "\nJust wanted to update that the problem appears to be fixed! \u00a0Although I'm not entirely sure what the original issue was. \u00a0I rebuilt my model step-by-step, testing outputs along the way. \u00a0When I connected the heating and cooling set point schedules this time, they were applied properly and the results show no conditioning outside of occupied hours. \u00a0I used identical schedules &amp; set points. \u00a0The only difference between the original and updated model is that I simplified the geometry for fewer zones. \u00a0I'm not sure why that would have affected assigning schedules. \u00a0Nevertheless, I'm happy that it is working!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Priya Gandhi", "created_at": "July 02, 2017 at 03:29AM", "created_by": "PriyaGandhi", "parent_id": "topic_1777018", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1777214"}
