{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI've been using Honeybee for a while with EnergyPlus, but this is the first time I'm trying to export a file to OpenStudio in order to create an HVAC system. I am using the latest release of HB&amp;LB (from last week). I've downloaded and installed OpenStudio 1.12.0 and made sure all the files are unblocked. Still, when I try to use the Export to OpenStudio component, I get the error\n\n\"Solution exception:The type initializer for 'OpenStudio.OpenStudioModelCorePINVOKE' threw an exception.\"\n\nwhich happens at the line\u00a0 \"model = ops.Model()\" in the script.\n\nI've tried uninstalling OpenStudio 1.12.0 and installing an older version (1.9.5) but get the same error.\n\n\n\nI've read through this thread ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/214](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/214)) but am not sure how to fix it. Any ideas on what to try? Is there any way around this?\n\n\n\nJust fyi, I am using a 64-bit Windows 7 Enterprise desktop PC.
