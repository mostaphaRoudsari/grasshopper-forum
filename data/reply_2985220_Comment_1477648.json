{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, I'd love if you could take a look at two of my files - I have one (#17) that is pulling in my json files from dropbox plus images from both dropbox and an FTP site. But the img and threeD files are being imported as parameters still. I didn't replace all the image/json file addresses with my own files.\u00a0\n\nThen I have a second file (#19) where I replaced more of the line items with my own data but now the 3D images won't load. I have mostly dropbox links (per #17) but also one ftp link. I see this instead:\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"210\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/oZ37sHtG0B*V2CZvRypSKxAb2cDxm6-c3kZeE8G2BXbZidTWywscYwgAqdlDLMqSVJL1WoQ9S7KIrZ34wDor2R4aRAvxOnpQ/DE_json.PNG?width=721\" width=\"391\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/oZ37sHtG0B*V2CZvRypSKxAb2cDxm6-c3kZeE8G2BXbZidTWywscYwgAqdlDLMqSVJL1WoQ9S7KIrZ34wDor2R4aRAvxOnpQ/DE_json.PNG)\n\n\n\nWhen I loaded my json file from dropbox or the ftp site into a plain webpage, it looked very similar to the dropbox json links from the DE example file. So I don't think it's the file itself.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1477649", "name": "DesignExplorer_SelectedResults17.csv"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1477650", "name": "DesignExplorer_SelectedResults19.csv"}], "created_by_name": "Lizzie Adams", "created_at": "March 4, 2016 at 6:26pm", "created_by": "LizzieAdams", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1474808", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1477648"}
