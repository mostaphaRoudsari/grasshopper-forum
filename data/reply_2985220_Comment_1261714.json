{"body": "\nHi Awkweird,\n\nGlad you use a simplified example. I tried the original and it was very heavy, so i dropped it.\n\nNow i checked this last file and it works for me. I noticed that you are not using the most updated components. It can be a reason of the error (though i'm in doubt). Just in case attached an updated file with last components version.\n\nAs Mostapha said, it can be a \"confusion\" with an existing file. Please check in:\n\nC:\\ladybug\\Test2\\EnergyPlus\n\nif you get the Test2.csv file and it is about 24Mb size.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1261716", "name": "Honeybeeissue3_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 13, 2015 at 1:55am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1261399", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1261714"}
