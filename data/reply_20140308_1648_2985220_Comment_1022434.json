{"body": "\nHi Yassin,\n\nThank you for reporting this. It is fine to use the latest version of GHPython (I actually added a check to ask the users to update to the latest version!)\n\nI guess this is an error with Copy.DeepCopy(). Can you test the attached file? It should work on your system but also give you a warning.\n\nI also added a component that should print paths and version of Python that you are using. Can you please send me an screenshot of the output on your system?\u00a0\u00a0That can help to track down the issue.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pVOWqi0dq19LSHVYldeg3c6uSLre2lCSZ9C5LU6t9pr6zwgUo4nQxOTRO82OTaFVuR*3oVcndElUCkzHf9pWJEQpqm3vMH*F/pythonVersion_.png?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pVOWqi0dq19LSHVYldeg3c6uSLre2lCSZ9C5LU6t9pr6zwgUo4nQxOTRO82OTaFVuR*3oVcndElUCkzHf9pWJEQpqm3vMH*F/pythonVersion_.png)\n\nThanks,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1022435", "name": "glazingPercentageVerticesError_II.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 08, 2014 at 04:48PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1022167", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1022434"}
