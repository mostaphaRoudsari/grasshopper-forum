{"body": "\nChris,\n\nThanks so much for the detailed reply.\n\nAs you suggested, I'm modeling hot-water separately now, and though it is fractional when cooling/lighting/equipment loads are set to normative values for current standards, when you push towards passive house standards it becomes a fairly large number. We're also interested in understanding the impact of new, highly efficient heat-pump water heaters. There is one that uses CO2 as a refrigerant with a COP of about 5 if I remember correctly. As a follow up question, do you know of any good resources for calculating equipment loads based on per appliance level details? (Online calc, or books?) We want to project the potential equipment loads from advances in efficiency (where we think they may occur) in future decades. We've done this fairly easily for lighting, but getting good numbers for stoves, laptops, etc., is not as clear-cut.\n\nRegarding heat recovery, I agree that we should be saving a fair amount on cooling (and non on heating), especially because we are setting ACH to about 0.35 (which is the local minimum requirements for new construction). I will look more into it and get back if the numbers continue to not make sense.\n\nI understand and expect the COP to be ignored since we're using ideal air loads. I am adding 5% after our COP division to try and be conservative on the actual impact. I know real-world systems will not behave as efficiently as ideal air load models.\n\n\n\nThanks again Chris.\n\n\n\nBest, David\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Birge", "created_at": "June 17, 2017 at 04:32PM", "created_by": "DavidBirge", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1768386", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1770548"}
