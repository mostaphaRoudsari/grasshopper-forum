{"body": "\nThank you very much, Chris!\n\n\n\nSomehow, I cannot reproduce the error I reported now... strangely...\n\n\n\nNevertheless, here are the original EPW and DDY files for Singapore downloaded from energyplus.net for your reference. Originally, I only have the EPW file in my system for simulation.\n\n\n\nI think it is not fair to you to take a lot of time to change the code of the Run Simulation component to suit for a particular weather file that may or may not generate error. So, maybe we can just follow your suggestion to use the Export to OpenStudio component from then on?\n\n\n\nThanks, again!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1570353", "name": "SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1570354", "name": "SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.ddy"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "July 23, 2016 at 06:52AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570431", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570352"}
