{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\n\nAwesome thanks! =D I am hosting several focus groups here in New Zealand to understand the possible barriers to implementing workflows using Honeybee and Ladybug in the design process within our building industry. Before hosting the focus groups, I will be introducing the practitioners to Honeybee and Ladybug by taking them through some exercises.\n\n\n\nHopefully it should be a lot of fun!\n\n- Elly\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "December 17, 2015 at 07:55PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1423244", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1423157"}
