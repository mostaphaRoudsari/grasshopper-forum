{"body": "\nHi Chris and Abraham,\n\n\n\nThank you for your replies.\n\n\n\nYe it's a big file, surface and zone data for the whole year. The shading reps are there so I can check the impact of vertical shading on the building (linking it on and off).\n\nI managed to actually make it run now. One of my zones had a double surface on the one side. I found and closed the brep. Not sure if that was the case but at least now it runs. The preview is still bugged though. I tried to check the normals but didn't work (changed all normals and problem is still there). Baking does bypass it as all I want is to visualize and save a .jpg for now.\n\n\n\nThanks for all the help!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 17, 2015 at 6:23pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1226317", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1226470"}
