{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI have a problem with the openstudio component. I get an almost empty file please find it attached. I got an old file previously fixed by Mostapha ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-export-t...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/hb-export-to-open-studio-not-working)) this one worked but when I updated the file with the new version I got back the 13.9 kb .osm file.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAm I missing something?
