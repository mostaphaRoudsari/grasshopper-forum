{"body": "\nHi Jose!\n\nHave you tried to run it manually by double clicking on the bat file? Go to c:\\ladybug\\SANTIAGO_CHL and try to manually execute the SANTIAGO_CHL_cumulativeSky.bat\u00a0file. If the same error pops up then I assume GenCumulativeSky.exe hasn't been fully downloaded on your system. You can download it from [here](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A821714), copy it to c:\\ladybug and retry. I hope it solves the problem.\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 05, 2013 at 06:39PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_844981", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_845667"}
