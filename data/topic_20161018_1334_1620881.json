{"body": "\nHi Everybody,\n\nI wanna do some optimization in Honeybee. I tried Galapagos coupling with Honeybee. The problem is I need to automate a procedure which optimization is a part of it. But Galapagos has an editor and needs to be started manually, therefore it is not a good option for me. A friend of mine here\u00a0suggested me to develop my own algorithm for my optimization. I want to know if anybody has done it before here. \u00a0I do appreciate any suggestion and feedback.\u00a0\n\nThanks a lot\n\nSaeed\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saeed", "created_at": "October 18, 2016 at 01:34PM", "created_by": "Saeed390", "topic": "Optimization by custom algorithm in Honeybee", "id": "topic_1620881"}
