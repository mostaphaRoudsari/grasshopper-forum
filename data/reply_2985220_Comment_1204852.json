{"body": "\nIf I want to create a Honeybee routine that samples a space with using this spherical sensor, how would I go about doing that?\n\n\n\nIf your interseted, here is my circumstance and how I'm currently gathering results.\n\nCurrently i'm modifying the pts vector in the grid analysis to always look up (+Zvector), rather than normal to the test surface in order to get a better result in section (otherwise they'd be shooting out into a wall). It still is only sampling as a hemisphere. The hemisphere makes total sense when evaluating the performance of a work surface, and room performance, but when evaluating an atrium in section, light comes from all angles, especially if the building opens up to side rather than just from above.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/51GNwYDFQ0SeWUst*Z2nvZeooSpP9uxO3MxBDjVxvnMmsxeI63y5mXjTAAPo6dx*4NUt8-Z5aQs-IeD99LSLxZXhjEn3V18p/141203L4Section2.0.jpg?width=750\"/>\n\n\n\nIn this image you can see the atrium has a bright spot part way down. This is from an opening in the building, and with hemispherical sampling, your not getting a complete picture of light behavior.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "will krzymowski", "created_at": "January 15, 2015 at 1:02pm", "created_by": "willkrzymowski", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1189547", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1204852"}
