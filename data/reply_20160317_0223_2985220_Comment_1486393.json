{"body": "\nI would recommend you to set a schedule for the blinds and be sure that the setpoint for the blinds to be on. You set 10 w/m2. I suspect the blinds are always on because of those conditions and then you don't get any change in the results.\n\nKeep in mind that the geometry the component is giving you is not relevant for the blinds. Only when you use the shadeBreps output as context.\n\nDon't know what to suggest to reduce the number of surfaces, beyond what Chris suggested in a different discussion. For your case it is not very effective. Maybe i'll use simple surfaces parametrically controlled.\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 17, 2016 at 02:23AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1486420", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1486393"}
