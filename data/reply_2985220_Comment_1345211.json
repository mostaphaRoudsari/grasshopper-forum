{"body": "\nHi Blanca,\n\nDo you have them added to the custom library or are you creating them live inside the file. If you're creating them in the file make sure you're not running Honeybee_Honeybee again which will overwrite the memory library (It is a bug which I need to fix soon). Adding them to custom library will solve the issue for now.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 18, 2015 at 8:14am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1344527", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1345211"}
