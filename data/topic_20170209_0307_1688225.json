{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI'm blaming myself a lot for not having considered this before, and it may be saying something really obvious, but I needed to check and I'm not finding the answer.\n\n\n\nIs ladybug considering the apparent solar time (sun-hour) or the mean solar time (clock-time)? As far as I understand it is the apparent solar time. So, could anybody confirm that my guessing is right saying:\n\nBeing less than 1degree longitude from the centre of my time zone (less than 1km from Greenwich):\n\n12:00 ladybug winter time = 12:00 clock\n\n12:00 ladybug summer time = 13:00 clock\n\n\n\nAm I right?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nJulia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julia T", "created_at": "February 09, 2017 at 03:07AM", "created_by": "JuliaT", "topic": "ladybug analysis period: sun-dial or clock-time", "id": "topic_1688225"}
