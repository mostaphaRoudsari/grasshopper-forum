{"body": "\nHi Anders,\n\nThank you for the kind comments! I'm so happy that you liked Ladybug. :)\n\nI should write a discussion or capture a video to discuss \"sunlight hours\" versus \"radiation\". I'll be traveling for the next 10 days and probably I won't be able to do that before I come back! The quick reply is not to use sunlight hours for shading design. Sunlight hours is mainly a city planning measure.\n\nLadybug [as it is right now] doesn't consider indirect bounce and reflections [so material doesn't matter]. As far as you are using Ladybug for radiation analysis for outdoor analysis/massing studies it is fine but if you have surfaces with high reflectivity then you should use a more advanced tool like Honeybee/RADIANCE where you can assign the right material to the surface!\n\nThank you for keeping an eye for bugs inside the 'bug!\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 20, 2013 at 8:53am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_813266", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_813306"}
