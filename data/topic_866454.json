{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\nwhat is for the input Parallel\u00a0in Sunlight Hours Analysis component?\n\nIt need to be set to True if we have more Sunlight Hours Analysis\u00a0components (one each object to analyse) working at the same time? Like in the image I attach.\n\nActually i am working on a simulation to find the optimal reciprocal solution of three buildings (using Galapagos) so each time, in each\u00a0Sunlight Hours Analysis\u00a0component one building is the geometry and the other two are the context.\n\n\n\nThank you\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/NqkuYxlxVg3TKuAfb1asRb-78r8iv4hvNqGJ0s6*I62SxmZgoiP5IEMd4fu1K4QRySPudZ0GMR8XYkEPxxitwgUg-iMpCJrV/Parallel.JPG\" width=\"677\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/NqkuYxlxVg3TKuAfb1asRb-78r8iv4hvNqGJ0s6*I62SxmZgoiP5IEMd4fu1K4QRySPudZ0GMR8XYkEPxxitwgUg-iMpCJrV/Parallel.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "June 5, 2013 at 3:28am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "Parallel input in Sunlight Hours Analysis component", "id": "topic_866454"}
