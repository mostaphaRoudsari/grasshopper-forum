{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI've been playing a lot but so far i don't like the game ... :-)\n\nPlease see attached, where i tried to summarize what i tried. Maybe you have more ideas and probably better.\n\nI have 7 zones. In zones 3 and 5 i splitted the floors/ceilings in order to enable the E+ full shadow calculations.\n\nThe top of the table shows the default situation. I use the decomposeByType floors for the distFromFloorOrSrf_ input in the viewFactor component. At the right of this you see the influence of changing the grid size: The 0.5 change the configuration of the zones. Grid size 1 joins more areas resulting in less zones (comparing to the original number).\n\nAt the bottom i joined the floor meshes for the relevant zones (3 and 5). The result is even worst. Some areas are missing in the mesh calculation of the viewFactor.\n\n\n\nRight now can't think what else to try. Do you have any (brilliant) idea?\n\nImportant to say that there are airwalls between zone 5 and all other zones.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1651739", "name": "ViewFactorCases.docx"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 4, 2016 at 7:03am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1650659", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1651738"}
