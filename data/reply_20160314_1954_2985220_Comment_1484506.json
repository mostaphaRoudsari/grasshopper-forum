{"body": "\nHi Derin,\n\nThanks for testing out the components and for your post.\n\nThe issue you raise about boundaries makes sense. \u00a0They really should be optional as they are not necessary in order to write the THERM file. \u00a0I just committed some updated components to the github that have made them optional:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/a8e7255e89b1ab4...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/a8e7255e89b1ab4bab0cc8993789844c7834924e)\n\nYou will also find these components in the attached example GH file.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vsrr84R9iSyVIODpDtTgPlffUQx3zRtgkv6*Uw3BSQXMuUyrI3ZLfgRym*YOYVRxPXLSPOn39szxlOVJbOk5pqtnQI116sGZ/OptionalBoundaries.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vsrr84R9iSyVIODpDtTgPlffUQx3zRtgkv6*Uw3BSQXMuUyrI3ZLfgRym*YOYVRxPXLSPOn39szxlOVJbOk5pqtnQI116sGZ/OptionalBoundaries.JPG)\n\n\n\nI did not put in an option to change the angle of the window if it is in plan since I figured that, from a physics standpoint, all rotations of window sections in the XY plane would behave the same. \u00a0However, I realize that, if you want to coordinate your THERM model with other Rhino geometry, you might want to rotate these windows in plan. \u00a0Let me know if this is the reason why you would like to rotate the windows and I can find a way to work it in.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1484508", "name": "Galzing System From WINDOW.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 14, 2016 at 07:54PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1484413", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1484506"}
