{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\n\n\nThanks for the response. Yes I have thought of a typical WWR simplification. The external conditions are exactly the same, given that this is a roof in a more or less flat roof building, which will be situated in a quite open landscape (no buildings around shading). So while I agree that simplifying will not affect much on the exterior I still think it affects a lot on the interior. The roof spans many different zones, which will be impacted if there is one huge skylight in the centre.\n\n\n\nI am probably thinking of splitting the WWR in zones on the roof and then simplifying that per zone. I am guessing, really not sure, that will give more sensible results. I was just hoping there would be some workaround, e.g. using Window to produce some kind of perforated pattern or some shading component that could be applied. Guessing not though.\n\n\n\nAs for the InternalMass component, I believe it was Chris who said that the mass is only a thermal mass. So it won't really impact on solar radiation. I was looking for a way for internal shading (perforated screen pattern again).\n\n\n\nHey is there anyone out there working on an energy simulation software for such complex geometries? I know E+ is probably way ahead of anything and simplifying usually doesn't impact accuracy but it would be interesting to test.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 30, 2016 at 12:19am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519323", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519106"}
