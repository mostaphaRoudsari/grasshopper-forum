{"body": "\nAbraham, thanks for your help, but I have a few more questions. The wires are still orange in your work. does not it mean that there is something wrong? the next question, I set 10000 lux for sky illumination, does not it cause any problem? and the last one my honeybee is 59 and yours is 58 and the outputs of my daylight simulation is a bit different as you can see in the picture. which output should I choose instead of ResultFiles to see my RadMaterials? Thanks for your time.[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7d2WojAUVaoTipT51IRt6EYE*6o73VZTVPJh0HlspTgUJhoTYkNzmOBTrLT*tqq84kh83X27yftZsZzFajHzAk9dp6ClfFB7/tamrin2.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/7d2WojAUVaoTipT51IRt6EYE*6o73VZTVPJh0HlspTgUJhoTYkNzmOBTrLT*tqq84kh83X27yftZsZzFajHzAk9dp6ClfFB7/tamrin2.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1492901", "name": "tamrin.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1492902", "name": "tamrin2.png"}], "created_by_name": "ehsan sovizi", "created_at": "March 27, 2016 at 1:29am", "created_by": "ehsansovizi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1492988", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1492899"}
