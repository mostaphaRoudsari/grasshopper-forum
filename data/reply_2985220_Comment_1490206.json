{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nSorry I was out of office all this time didn't have time to check it. I believe I will be running the case again tomorrow so I can check it then. Have you tried yourself in the meantime? Let me know if you do. I didn't try the top view per se I just saw the patterns of light and shadows seemed to be opposite, from the attached pictures.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 22, 2016 at 8:23pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1487362", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490206"}
