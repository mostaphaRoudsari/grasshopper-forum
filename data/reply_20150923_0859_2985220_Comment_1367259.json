{"body": "\nHi Elzine and Mostafa,\n\nunfortunately I didn't take a picture or saved the result, actuly it was conclusion of a series of calculation.\n\nbut it had difference was high,\n\nfor example I tested some WWR according to UDI in Tehran, and the best one was 40% in the first computer and the same gh file on the other computer showed me 16% which sounds wired!\n\nNow, I am working on the second computer and don't have access to the first one, I guess something is wrong with this computer, I can't trust on the results! Is there a way I get sure that the results are OK?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Fahimeh Motazedian", "created_at": "September 23, 2015 at 08:59AM", "created_by": "FahimehMotazedian", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1366930", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1367259"}
