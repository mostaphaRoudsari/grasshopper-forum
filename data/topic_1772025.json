{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nSince a few days I have searched solution for my project and I couldn't find, so\u00a0I hope\u00a0you will be able to help me.\n\nI have to do Sun analysis for my final project and I found out that the\u00a0best for it is Ladybug,\u00a0so I have been starting to watch some tutorials ( also it's my first time when Im using Grasshopper)\u00a0in order to fix it.\u00a0I think\u00a0that\u00a0less or more\u00a0I've done\u00a0my\u00a0Sun Path, but now there is a problem which I cannot solve.\n\nMy building is the green one, and I want to extend it as long as I can. But becouse of regulations I cannot\u00a0overshadow the building (\u00a0only the red surface) \u00a0which is next to my. The minium hour of shadowed has to be 1,5 -2.\n\nIs it any chance to extend my building according to requirments which I wrote ? Some parametric solution ? Or do I have to do it manually by trial and error?\n\n\n\nPs. I heard that Galapagos is a tool which could help me, but I've no idea what it is :([<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/yu7QMiCGvgFbiojKWKM*9Jfkp8HLnLZfSLWAw6FYfVo4F1n53B1bEWoJpOn72fpJB3*kZjp9HbAhOUaFObr8XX5Owe0TOe0J/SunPath.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/yu7QMiCGvgFbiojKWKM*9Jfkp8HLnLZfSLWAw6FYfVo4F1n53B1bEWoJpOn72fpJB3*kZjp9HbAhOUaFObr8XX5Owe0TOe0J/SunPath.jpg)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1772023", "name": "Sun_Path_lepszy_RhinoAutosave(20388).3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1772024", "name": "Sunpath_part3.gh"}], "created_by_name": "\u0141ukasz Dwulit", "created_at": "June 20, 2017 at 12:20pm", "created_by": "LukaszDwulit", "topic": "SunPath", "id": "topic_1772025"}
