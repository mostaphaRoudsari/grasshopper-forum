{"body": "\nHi Mostapha/Chris,\n\n\n\nA quick question. \u00a0I am running an office daylight simulation and would like to model the user behavior like this: \u00a0Glare is indicated by horizontal illuminance above a certain level X. \u00a0If - at any point during the day - the average illuminance exceeds X, then the blinds are closed. \u00a0The blinds only have two opportunities to reopen during the day: \u00a0First thing in the morning and right after lunch (since people probably won't be experimentally opening the windows every hour).\n\n\n\nFor bonus points, it would be nice to add a further detail. \u00a0I'd like to assume that the blinds will be closed if either of two conditions are met. \u00a01) the average illuminance exceeds X and 2) the illuminance at any sensor point exceeds Y.\n\n\n\nIt can be done in excel - but would be cooler/quicker to do the whole thing in Grasshopper.\n\n\n\nThanks much!\n\n-John\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Sullivan", "created_at": "June 14, 2015 at 06:11AM", "created_by": "JohnSullivan", "topic": "Custom blind control in Honeybee", "id": "topic_1308772"}
