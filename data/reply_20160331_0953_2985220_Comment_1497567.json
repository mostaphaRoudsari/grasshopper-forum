{"body": "\nDear djordje.<br/> <br/> Thank you for your generous answer it really helped a lot.\u00a0 All of the suggestions you made are so meaningful to my small research, and I think I will consider number 3 which seems more suitable to my case. I tired the **PV SWH system** component but it only worked on ground (xy) plane. I cannot wait to try your updated component and let you know if there are any other things regarding this issue. <br/> <br/> Once again, thank you very much and have a great day!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "March 31, 2016 at 09:53AM", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1497434", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1497567"}
