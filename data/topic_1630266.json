{"body": "\nHello\n\n\n\nI have downloaded E+ version 8.4 and it works currently in my HoneyBee. However, I want to use Importidf feature in HoneyBee and I want to import an idf file generated by GBS. E+ version to open an idf file created by GBS should be anything higher than 8.4 (confirmed by E+ support group).\u00a0\n\nNow my question is what version of E+ should I have in HoneyBee to be able to use \"importidf\" and read my idf file created by GBS.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks a million.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 1, 2016 at 12:40pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "EnergyPlus Version in HoneyBee", "id": "topic_1630266"}
