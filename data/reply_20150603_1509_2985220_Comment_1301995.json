{"body": "\nDaniel,\n\nFind\u00a0 a working file.\n\nA lot of things to fix:\n\nNo material were defined/assigned for the surfaces in your file, so no wonder it didn't find (or i understood something wrong in your comment). I defined and set them. (See blue group)\n\nNo windows in the external facade. Added one. Also set a material for it (see red and yellow groups)\n\nThe RunE+ was updated in your file, but the component changed input numbers, so there was a need to reinsert.\n\nProbably i'm forgetting something else ...\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1301997", "name": "HBgeneration_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 03, 2015 at 03:09PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1301608", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1301995"}
