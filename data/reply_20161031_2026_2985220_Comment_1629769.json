{"body": "\nHi Lyndon,\n\n\n\nSorry I think we are out of reply nesting.\n\n\n\nThe case you are referring to is kind of a classic case for CFD studies. It is something that has been done and validated in OpenFOAM (as far as I know) and you can even find similar examples in the OF tutorials (like the Dam case).\n\n\n\nIn that sense, yes Butterfly is able to handle that. Coupled with Rhino/GH makes BF able to provide a link to a very good 3D modelling environment and to parametric possibilities (e.g. see the effect of changing the radius of the pipe, and so on).\n\n\n\nThat said, such cases might require considerable experience in meshing, running and post-processing. It's a bit out of my expertise since I focus mainly on the built evironment. However, apart from the OF tutorials (you can find them in your OF installation folder, search for dam) there's a lot of information about all this in cfd-online.\n\n\n\nGood luck, let us know how it goes!\n\n<br/>Kind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "October 31, 2016 at 08:26PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1629602", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1629769"}
