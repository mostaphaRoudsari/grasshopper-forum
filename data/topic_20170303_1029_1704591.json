{"body": "\nHello I am trying to analyse the radiation or light wave distance vs intensity - maybe creating a chart to see the the units?\n\nI have done the chart of sunpath and radiation but how may i find out the length and intensity at certain time?\n\n\n\n[please see images and a skecth of what i have done already and please advise on to make it calculated?\n\n\n\nThank youuu :)\n\nAna\n\n\n\n\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/sunlight-wavelength-in-lo...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/sunlight-wavelength-in-london?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1704814&amp;xg_source=msg_com_forum)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1704588", "name": "22.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1704589", "name": "Untitled (1).png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1704590", "name": "2233.png"}], "created_by_name": "Ana Sidorova", "created_at": "March 03, 2017 at 10:29AM", "created_by": "AnaSidorova", "topic": "sunlight wavelength vs intensity(heat)in london", "id": "topic_1704591"}
