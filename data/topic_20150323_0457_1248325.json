{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI have a model where I need to add custom glazing and properties to some zones.\n\n\n\nCurrent process: I take BREPs that I turn into HB Surfaces, then I add the glazing BREP to get HB Surfaces with Glazing, and ultimately I get HB Zones.\n\n\n\nProblem: I'd like to solve adjacencies between these zones.\n\n\n\nBut the Honeybee_IntersectMasses component, as stated in the code: \"only works with raw Rhino brep geometry and not HBZones.\u00a0 Use this component before you turn your breps into HBZones\".\n\n\n\nSo considering I have already turned my raw Rhino geometry to HBZones, is it possible to intersect them then?\n\n\n\nOr should I do the intersection using all my initial surface BREPs, and explode that, select to find the relevant surfaces and start the \"Current process\" stated above again?\n\nIf so, is there an easy way to select the relevant surfaces after the intersection process?\n\n\n\nI would like to avoid running the intersection tool, baking the geometry in Rhino and start the process, and this is not my final design and therefore I'd like it to stay linked to Rhino if possible.\n\n\n\nThanks for any help you can provide,\n\nJulien\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julien Marrec", "created_at": "March 23, 2015 at 04:57AM", "created_by": "JulienMarrec", "topic": "Intersect when creating Zones from individual surfaces", "id": "topic_1248325"}
