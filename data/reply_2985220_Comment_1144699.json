When you add it to the library using the component it will be in the memory and won't be written to any file (I know what you are thinking about now, read the next one).\n\n\n\n3 &amp; 4. In case you have materials and constructions already created just copy them to\u00a0\"LadybugFolderOnYourMachine\\userCustomLibrary.idf\" and it will be loaded every time you let the Honeybee fly. This is your custom library and won't be ever overwritten. You can copy any standard material, construction or schedule and it will be added to Honeybee library.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 7, 2014 at 3:07pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1144663", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1144699"}
