{"body": "\nHi Nita,\n\nSome good news but also bad.\n\nAttached a file where i get the geometry clean so the zone is finally a closed brep. One of the problems was that the shaded area in the corner was defined as part of the zone. You should define this as shading elements. I put at the left those geometry surfaces that are not necessary for the zone creation. Also deleted what is not necessary, just for my own sake trying to understand the mess.\n\nThe bad news is that the EnergySimulation component is giving a severe error that i can't get what is it. The error says:\n\n[1 of 7] Writing simulation parameters...<br/>Runtime error (IndexOutOfRangeException): index out of range: 34<br/>Traceback:<br/>\u00a0 line 813, in groundTempData, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/>\u00a0 line 1070, in main, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/>\u00a0 line 1430, in script\n\nChris or Mostapha should know how to deal with this one, hopefully.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1267425", "name": "TestHB2_NEW_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 19, 2015 at 3:10pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1267313", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1267424"}
