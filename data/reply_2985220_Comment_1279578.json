{"body": "\nHi Ding,\n\nTo give a slightly theoretical/philosophical answer, I removed the total energy output because the second law of thermodynamics places energy in a hierarchy from most concentrated/ordered/high exergy/low entropy\u00a0to dispersed/disordered/low exergy/high entropy. \u00a0AC or DC electricity is a very highly ordered form of energy and thus is very valuable while thermal energy is a very disordered form of energy and thus not so valuable (or just much easier to obtain). \u00a0Accordingly, it is really not correct to draw an equivalence between thermal and electrical energy, which is what you are doing when you add them together.\n\nYou can always use the \"Separate Data\" component and the native grasshopper math components to add the E+ results together but I wanted users to be aware that this is not a method favored by the scientific community.\n\nFrom what I understand, the daylight threshold had never really been implemented on the back end. \u00a0We might do this at some point.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 3, 2015 at 10:17pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279420", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279578"}
