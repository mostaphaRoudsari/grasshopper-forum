{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm fairly new in PV panel design and I'm wondering if it is possible to optimize the placement of PVs using HB/LB. If this isn't possible using HB/LB can anyone recommend another plug-in. I've tried Archisim but I wasn't able to get any results out of the PV simulation component for some reason.\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "March 19, 2015 at 12:09PM", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "topic": "Is there an ideal workflow for optimizing the placement of PV panels?", "id": "topic_1246046"}
