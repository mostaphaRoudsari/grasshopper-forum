{"body": "\nDoes it really matter when doing energy simulation when the EPconstruction type is same?\n\nYou should also consider the Boundary Condition which for a slabOnGrade is Ground but for exposedFloor is Outdoors. Your input 2.25 is underground slab and not 2.5 slabOnGrade. In any case, Decompose based on type is for visualization and as far as the construction and boundary condition is set correctly it will work fine in EnergyPlus.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 11, 2017 at 7:05am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1749657", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749744"}
