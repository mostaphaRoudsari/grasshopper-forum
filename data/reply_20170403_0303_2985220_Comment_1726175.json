{"body": "\nHi all!<br/> On my windows 10 I couldn't install the 9.0 version of matlab runtime (I got the message \"this app can't run on this pc\", maybe some new update of w10 made it not compatible with earlier version?). I've been able to install the last one (9.2), now I've got problem in finding the UWG installer (can't find a \"download\" button on the page you linked). I contacted last week the developer because on the download page it was saying \"UWG code available upon request\" but I still didn't get any answer...\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Filippo", "created_at": "April 03, 2017 at 03:03AM", "created_by": "Filippo", "parent_id": "topic_1595761", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726175"}
