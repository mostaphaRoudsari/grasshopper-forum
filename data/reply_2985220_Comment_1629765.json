{"body": "\nHi Lyndon,\n\n\n\nSorry for the late reply. As Mostapha said these are the links to download.\n\n\n\nConcerning the differences between the two versions, if you are interested you can check this very interesting (and TLDR) post ([http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam/165322-openfoam-v3-0-a.html](http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam/165322-openfoam-v3-0-a.html)). Especially Wyldckat's post #13 onwards goes almost over the whole history of OF development and the nuances therein.\n\n\n\nOn a production side, we hope to have BF working with the new OF4.0 very soon. Actually it should already work as is even if you installed the new version up to the running the case. Post-processing would not however. We will try and include this in the next release.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "October 31, 2016 at 8:01pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1629662", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1629765"}
