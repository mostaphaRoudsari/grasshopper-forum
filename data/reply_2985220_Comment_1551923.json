{"body": "\nHi Jacek,\n\n\n\n... \"humidex\" or \"Discomfort index\" give a result drastically lower, I think it was even 1-5% comfortable.\n\n<br/>Some of the thermal comfort indices you see in the \"Thermal Comfort Indices\" component are experiential or location specific. For example:\u00a0[humidex](http://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=6C5D4990-1#humidex) has been derived and widely used in Canada.<br/>Also both humidex and discomfort index should be used in in-shade conditions.<br/>For universal applications and locations, you should concentrate on either PET or\u00a0[UTCI](http://www.utci.org/) (this is what \"Outdoor Comfort Calculator\" component is based on).\n\n\n\n<br/>I have found out, that for instance - OutdoorComfortCalculator - which considers temperatures of 9-26 and other factors, gives the % of comfortable time outdoor for instance in Kenya in Africa (high temperatures and humidity) 55%, whereas within the same .epw data and some additional factors added to the Thermal Indices component, the \"humidex\" or \"Discomfort index\" give a result drastically lower, I think it was even 1-5% comfortable.<br/>How is that?\n\n<br/>Yes, this is one of the issues that I have with UTCI index: the authors wanted to make it as an index applicable in any type of climate. To create the UTCI comfort categories a number of data has been collected from different locations (for hot humid climate, it was the data from Madagascar. I may be wrong on this). This resulted in universal comfortable range of 9 to 26 C which you mentioned. How would the people in Madagascar perceive the feel like temperature of 9 degrees as comfortable is beyond my understanding.<br/>Thermophysiology of a human in Madagascar, and in Poland is the same. However their acclimatization is quite different, which raises the issue with the upper universal comfortable range. In general people who live in hotter climates have a bit higher tolerance to high temperature than those living in continental climates. And vice-versa: their tolerance to lower temperatures is lower than the tolerance of the people from the continental climates. Here is a comparison of the UTCI - PET stress categories:\n\n\n\n**UTCI**\n\nall climates\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 stress category\n\nabove +46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 extreme heat stress<br/>+38 to +46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 very strong heat stress<br/>+32 to +38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 strong heat stress<br/>+26 to +32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 moderate heat stress<br/>**+9 to +26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no thermal stress**<br/>+9 to 0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 slight cold stress<br/>0 to -13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 moderate cold stress<br/>-13 to -27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 strong cold stress<br/>-27 to -40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 very strong cold stress<br/>below -40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 extreme cold stress<br/><br/><br/>\n\n**PET**\n\n(sub)tropical humid climate \u00a0 temperate climate \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 stress category<br/><br/>above +42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 above +41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 extreme heat stress<br/>+38 to +42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +35 to +41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 strong heat stress<br/>+34 to +38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +29 to +35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 moderate heat stress<br/>+30 to +34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +23 to +29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 slight heat stress<br/>***+26 to +30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +18 to +23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no thermal stress***<br/>+22 to +26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +13 to +18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 slight cold stress<br/>+18 to +22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +8 to +13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 moderate cold stress<br/>+14 to +18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +4 to +8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 strong cold stress<br/>below +14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 below +4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 extreme cold stress\n\n<br/><br/>I attached below an example of PET humid climate comparison with UTCI, for in-shade and out-shade conditions.<br/>As it can be seen UTCI shows the percent of time comfortable: two times higher than PET.<br/><br/>\n\n<br/>Thank you Pin, for the useful comment, on usage of \"Analysis period\" component.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1551925", "name": "pet_vs_utci_humid_tropical_climate.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "June 21, 2016 at 6:06am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "topic_1551290", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1551923"}
