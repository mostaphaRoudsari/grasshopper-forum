However, weather file data is not ( data is give on the hour: 7:00, 8:00, 9:00 ...) and DAYSIM seems that it dose not calculate external horizontal diffuse illuminance.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Khalid Al", "created_at": "December 31, 2015 at 01:29AM", "created_by": "KhalidAl", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1428472", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1428719"}
