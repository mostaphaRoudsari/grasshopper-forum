{"body": "\nThanks J for your response.\n\nI had a look at your suggestions. \u00a0Several notes:\n\n1. I switched the simulation from \"Full Interior &amp; Exterior\" solar distribution to run on \"Full Exterior\" solar distribution. \u00a0This switch did get all of the severe E+ errors to disappear.\u00a0 Also, it initially got the glazing surface results to read. \u00a0Then I ran the simulation a second time and the results disappeared again. \u00a0Any idea why the surface results disappear the second go round? \u00a0\n\n2. \u00a0As for the surface normals, the normals of the surfaces coming out of the \"Glazing Based on Ratio\" component do seem to be oriented both in the correct direction, both oriented outward. See the image below. \u00a0I've also tested it using the Child Surface method with the \"addHBglz\" component, and all of those surfaces are also correctly oriented outward. \u00a0When I rerun both simulations, the surface data still does not read surface results for the glazing (it does read the surface results from opaque portion of the wall). \u00a0\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" height=\"308\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/rhqcRsJl7aRfhBxK**a1nS13OkYE6YorU-0gWwSdFVaIqAjE-10rwfKo*maFj*4LOb78H*hU2muxSB1Ia1xe3tKuEvs-2Jcg/GlazingSurfaceNormals.JPG?width=721\" width=\"607\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/rhqcRsJl7aRfhBxK**a1nS13OkYE6YorU-0gWwSdFVaIqAjE-10rwfKo*maFj*4LOb78H*hU2muxSB1Ia1xe3tKuEvs-2Jcg/GlazingSurfaceNormals.JPG)\n\n\n\n3. 3.Lastly, any suggests for getting an off the shelf mech system hooked up so the results will read as End Use Energy Consumption, rather than the Ideal Air Loads? \u00a0Any suggestions would be great!\n\nThanks for your help.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Patrick Keeney", "created_at": "April 17, 2015 at 03:26PM", "created_by": "PatrickKeeney", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1264553", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1266164"}
