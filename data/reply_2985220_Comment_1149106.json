{"body": "\nGreat,\n\nAs Always Chris you've\u00a0come to the rescue. I wish at some time I'll be able to post some images and workarounds of these projects. So far they are in a confidential state and I can't show anything. But in time I'll try to post something.\n\nOne more question: How can I control the reflectiveness of the mirror like Srf as it requires R-G-BReflectance (I guess that is RGB colors) if the glass reflects 27% of the light should I input 27 for all three. I try to understand the Radiance materials (www. artifice.com) but it does not say much. And what kind of sky should be used for the analysis recipe\n\nThank you\n\nCheers\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "October 15, 2014 at 7:49am", "created_by": "Claudio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1149024", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1149106"}
