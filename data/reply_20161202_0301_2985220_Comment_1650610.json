{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nI am supporting MMerlin in this activity.\n\n\n\nI followed your instructions and I used EP materials with mass.\n\nHowever, I have still serious issues about schedules. I would like to define two standard cases, one for winter and one for summer,\u00a0 occupation 5 days per week from 9.00 to 18.00. \u00a0\n\nAs you can see, during the range above I have defined the setpoints for heating (20\u00b0C) and cooling (26\u00b0C), leaving 0\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C (respectively for heating and cooling) to simulate the hours we do not want the HVAC system working (holidays, night, etc.).\n\nIt seems there is something wrong on this approach because I still obtain just a result for cooling. We have tried to follow an alternative path, creating a .csv schedule, but it does not work for the OpenStudio Command.\n\n\n\nSo, how can I define a working schedule, considering the information above?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nRiccardo\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1650612", "name": "Thermalloads_FORUM2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Riccardo Diaferia", "created_at": "December 02, 2016 at 03:01AM", "created_by": "RiccardoDiaferia49", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1643940", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1650610"}
