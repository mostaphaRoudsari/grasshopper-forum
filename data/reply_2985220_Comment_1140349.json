{"body": "\nHi Chris, no worries.\n\n\n\nMy internet connection is behind a corporate firewall and very difficult to get around, so I agree it could be an issue here.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately the openstudio files downloaded and placed in the spec'd location didn't have an effect.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt did however highlight for me that not all content is defaulting to c:\\ladybug.\u00a0 Model results seem to go between that location and the appdata\\roaming folder for ladybug instead.\u00a0 I copied the openstudio files into there as well, but no luck.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, which is even stranger, my GH file asks for HB and LB to be flown even after the file has initialised (346.7 seconds...), so I have to delete and re-drop them onto the canvas.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll very strange, and my colleague who is running an older version of HB and LB doesn't have these issues.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLast but not least, these issues are happening on my new system as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks for all the help, let me know anything you ned from me to help identify what this could be!\n\n\u00a0\n\nCheers\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ben Foster", "created_at": "September 30, 2014 at 10:04pm", "created_by": "BenFoster", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1140021", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1140349"}
