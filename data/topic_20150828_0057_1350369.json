{"body": "\nIt seems a customized schedule produced by the **Honeybee_Create CSV Schedule** component is not acceptable by the **Honeybee_Add to EP library** component.\n\n\n\nMay I ask how to add a customized schedule to the project library and call it for other use? Otherwise, we may need to manually connect the **csvSchedule** output node on the **Honeybee_Create CSV Schedule** component to other place requesting a schedule.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks![<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-oaic7y9RVRar7dxRhKlvCgEuw7TyFuZUUYGvLnwwoflir1pbEXsFVWEYqBrGJOeZI8yZqjRz3HBIIntkyVLfSpGU0ENCiRA/09.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-oaic7y9RVRar7dxRhKlvCgEuw7TyFuZUUYGvLnwwoflir1pbEXsFVWEYqBrGJOeZI8yZqjRz3HBIIntkyVLfSpGU0ENCiRA/09.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1350368", "name": "schedule.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 28, 2015 at 12:57AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "how to save a customized schedule to the project library?", "id": "topic_1350369"}
