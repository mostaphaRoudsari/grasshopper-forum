{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThanks for your comment.\n\nI guess regards to my project I should do it in the first way you said (if I understood it correctly). because I need to define the variables out of the optimizer and then optimizer\u00a0just automatically generate values of the variables and evaluate the objective function. before I used GenOpt coupling with EnergyPlus and here Galapagos with Honeybee; but since I haven't written an optimization code by myself, I wanted to see if somebody has done it here then maybe I could use the same algorithm and also know how to integrate it with Honeybee. Above, John suggested DEAP, but it seems there are some difficulties to use it in Grasshopper! \u00a0 \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saeed", "created_at": "October 19, 2016 at 12:08PM", "created_by": "Saeed390", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1621354", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1621660"}
