Yes, HB+ will replace the legacy version (the \"current\" one) at some point, although it will be at least several months before all of the features of the legacy version are in the plus version. \u00a0Stay tuned to that github to find way to get involved.\n\n2. HB[+] is intended to work with many different versions of python, including ironPython (that which is used by Rhino 5 and Rhino 6), Python 2.7, and all of the way to Python 3.6. \u00a0There will be no need to let HB_HB fly or to use sticky as most code will be in external .py files. \u00a0As such, it will be cross-platform. \u00a0See here for the list of reasons why the code is being re-written:\n\n[https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybee/issues/122](https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybee/issues/122)\n\nI hope this helps clarify,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 28, 2017 at 1:08pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678755", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1680116"}
