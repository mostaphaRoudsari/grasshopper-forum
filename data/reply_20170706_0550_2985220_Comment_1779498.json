{"body": "\nThank you Chris for this pretty quick answer !\n\n\n\nI'm going to watch theses videos right now...\n\nBut in any case, the radiation analysis isn't matching my needs since there is a direct relationship between the total radiation received on the shell (that i try to increase) and the shell surface area (that i'm trying to minimize according to heat Loss)... After Optimization, it leads to an irrelevant pareto front, thus the need to measure inside performances and microclimate data to be abble to compare results properly ...\n\nAnyway, thank you very much fo your help and as you said, i'm going to improve the definition on a more regular shape to quickly isolate geometrical issues from basic HB mistakes i've made\n\n\n\nBest regards\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "edwin szabo", "created_at": "July 06, 2017 at 05:50AM", "created_by": "edwinszabo", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1779491", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1779498"}
