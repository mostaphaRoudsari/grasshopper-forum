{"body": "\nVladir,\n\nThanks for spreading the knowledge of the bug and bee to Brazil. \u00a0A few quick notes about your model:\n\n1) You are using an older version of Honeybee and I would suggest updating to the latest one.\n\n2) There is no need to decompose the zones into surfaces. \u00a0The new HBGlzSrf component can just take all your zones and all of your window geomtries and assign them to correct zones. \u00a0E+ cannot take 100% glazing surfaces and there must always be some offset between window boundaries and wall boundaries. \u00a0Just add the window geometries manually after scaling the wall surfaces down a bit.\n\n3) The most important part of having a decently accurate energy model is that you get the programs and uses of the zones correct. \u00a0As such, I would recommend organizing your model with each program type having its own mass2Zone component.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 30, 2016 at 10:02pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1493332", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1496788"}
