{"body": "\nHi Daniel,\n\nThe file runs totally fine on my system. The line that you get the error (271) is the line that component tries to import the results and it can't find any. Can you try the attached file again.\n\nIf it didn't work can you share with me the files inside the analysis folder?\n\nHave you tried to run other type of analysis (e.g. daylight factor) on your system. I wonder if the issue is with running Radiance on your system or just cumulative analysis?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/VRZzgEZ7j933knpRMV2-jqHWd89S4XR-*qflSNEAMKnwKM1RIxvNeZfQmakiTlqiQ9KT6waJwiEprsWdxMvM4ZOu7ht-7lDu/cumulativeRadiation.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/VRZzgEZ7j933knpRMV2-jqHWd89S4XR-*qflSNEAMKnwKM1RIxvNeZfQmakiTlqiQ9KT6waJwiEprsWdxMvM4ZOu7ht-7lDu/cumulativeRadiation.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1200110", "name": "radiationanalysisbug_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 06, 2015 at 03:30PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1200244", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1199808"}
