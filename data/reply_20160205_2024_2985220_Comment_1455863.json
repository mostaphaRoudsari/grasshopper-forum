{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for the reply. What I was asking is something much more lazier than that! :)\n\n\n\nI was thinking if we could generate those namedViews by plugging in a zone to a component/input. Maybe the view could be positioned just inside of the middle of one of the walls, looking in? Now that I think about it maybe I can do it with native components. It should be easy to get the normal and the point, can you get a view out of this in GH? If we could also manipulate lens from GH should be set. I'll look into it after my break perhaps native GH can do it.\n\n\n\nIn any case, could be something useful or not. I know that it could be useful in this simulation but not in many others (maybe glare).\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 05, 2016 at 08:24PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455860", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455863"}
