{"body": "\nI know related issues have been discussed here many times, but I am not sure I understand how the update Honeybee component is supposed to work. I need to update an old Grasshopper file with components from the newest HB release. Do I have it correct that this is what \"updateThisFile\" is supposed to do? When I toggle this input to true, I get the following error:\n\nDownloading the source code...<br/>Runtime error (MissingMemberException): 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'Objects'<br/>Traceback:<br/> line 133, in getAllTheComponents, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/> line 278, in main, \"&lt;string&gt;\"<br/> line 289, in script\n\n\n\nI have dozens of HB components in this file and it would be tedious to update them one by one. I dropped new Honeybee and Update Honeybee components on the canvas. \u00a0Any help would be much appreciated!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ernst Bay", "created_at": "March 29, 2017 at 1:19pm", "created_by": "ErnstBay", "topic": "Honeybee updateThisFile error", "id": "topic_1723549"}
