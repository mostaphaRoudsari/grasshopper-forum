{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nthank you so much for your time and help. I did realize that after the simulation my surfaces where missing pieces and I kept working on the geometry until this didnt happen. I even tried on a shoebox model and\u00a0I got confused when it did work with an EP weather file but not with a meteonorm one! Next time I'll keep checking my geometry and how it comes in and out of the HB components instead of just my curves.\n\n\n\nThank you so much:) I am happy you got to learn a couple of thing on the way!\n\nBlanca\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Blanca Dasi Espuig", "created_at": "August 05, 2015 at 05:17AM", "created_by": "BlancaDasiEspuig", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1338075", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1338551"}
