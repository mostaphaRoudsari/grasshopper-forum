{"body": "\nThe culprit is the dielectric material....rays tend to get \"lost\" inside it (or something like that).\u00a0 Especially if it is a solid where light is supposed to enter and leave. I used to think that it had something to do with total internal reflection. Since Radiance is a stochastic ray tracing engine, there will always be some rays that undergo total internal reflection.\n\nI once had an\u00a0[online discussion](https://unmethours.com/question/11541/how-does-one-correct-errors-related-to-truncated-images/?answer=11571#post-id-11571) with Greg Ward\u00a0 about this. I am pasting the relevant excerpt below:\n\n\n\nIs there a way to debug or track a rendering processes during runtime ie to know if it will render at all ? Secondly, is there a likelihood of something like total internal reflection happening and light rays not escaping ?\n\nThe progress reports are the best way to make sure that the renderings are progressing, which they seemed to be doing until they got killed. Even in cases where total internal reflection prevents rays escaping, the tracing will hit some limit (either -lw or -lr and setting both to 0 will give an error) to prevent an infinite loop. Believe me, if there were any infinite loops in Radiance, people would be complaining about it!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "February 22, 2016 at 09:50PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1469416", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1469257"}
