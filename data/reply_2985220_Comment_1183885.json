{"body": "\nIt was a bug and it was deep down in the Honeybee_Honyebee reEvaluateHBZone. I'm surprised that no one has reported this before. Looks like it is not happening in all cases. Maybe a good reason to have a new release. Thank you both for reporting and checking this.\u00a0Just checked with Chris and he has number of examples for construction test which is working fine.
