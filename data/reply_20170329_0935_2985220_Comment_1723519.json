{"body": "\nHi Florian,\n\nDo you have all the HDR images in the same folder? As Rob already answered in radiance mailing list you can use radiance pextrem command ([http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/pextrem.1.html](http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/pextrem.1.html)) to get the location and the value. Then you need to parse the output to get the max value and then store it in a text file. We don't have a component but this is an easy enough task to do if you know a little bit of scripting.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 29, 2017 at 09:35AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1723264", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1723519"}
