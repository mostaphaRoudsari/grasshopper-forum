{"body": "\nHello everyone!\n\n\n\nI have encountered a problem running a daylight simulation on one of our computers. When running the simulation, the cmd windows just show up very briefly without any content in. Then the end I get this message.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"228\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bdcrBfX-ENsrn4N2zYsj8738M8k02D8KS-Xt6zH9uXNO75Fi3WJ1LSK5Ze-g5aYXFZZeKa*qVtkY6u6z79drpadtBSrnZEYg/ladybug3.PNG?width=750\" width=\"385\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bdcrBfX-ENsrn4N2zYsj8738M8k02D8KS-Xt6zH9uXNO75Fi3WJ1LSK5Ze-g5aYXFZZeKa*qVtkY6u6z79drpadtBSrnZEYg/ladybug3.PNG)\n\nAfter going to the source folder it seems that some files have not been generated (for example the .oct file). So it seems that no results were generated, as I understand oconv did not run at all.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"220\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bdcrBfX-ENus2M9XIDeWv8sfVFctj-nLqgsGIlx5IDIhZx03y1C8mmsPXI0IPRTx-DpuvMX3rcqOJ0mLFKgpKKZFg0PA7Isy/ladybug2.PNG?width=750\" width=\"386\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bdcrBfX-ENus2M9XIDeWv8sfVFctj-nLqgsGIlx5IDIhZx03y1C8mmsPXI0IPRTx-DpuvMX3rcqOJ0mLFKgpKKZFg0PA7Isy/ladybug2.PNG)\n\nEverything was recently reinstalled, using all of the newest versions of Radiance, DAYSIM, Energy plus and LB and HB.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDo you think it is an Radiance installation problem (even though all files seem to be in place) \u00a0or LB &amp; HB?\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have never had this problem before, so if anyone has a solution please let me know.\n\n\n\nM.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mihail Todorov", "created_at": "September 08, 2016 at 03:17AM", "created_by": "MihailTodorov", "topic": "empty cmd when running daylight simulation", "id": "topic_1595847"}
