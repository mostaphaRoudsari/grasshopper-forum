{"body": "\nChris and Ale,\n\nThank you guys for your help. I'm working on two projects right now, one of them studies the glare caused by PV panels, I think I'm going to use a mirror material for the PV panels. The other project is to examine interior daylighting conditions based on changes to an exterior lightshelf and ceiling material. I think I'm going to use the trans material for this project, I'll test run the trans material as you suggested.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ninja", "created_at": "May 4, 2015 at 5:09pm", "created_by": "RaniaLabib", "parent_id": "topic_1278640", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280359"}
