{"body": "\nHi Michael,\n\n\n\nThis issue is related to parsing Radiance materials from strings. Inside the [Honeybee source-code](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeybee_Honeybee.py), parsing of Radiance materials from strings is done by the functions called\u00a0[createRadMaterialFromString](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeybee_Honeybee.py#L1011-L1042) and\u00a0[analyseRadMaterials.](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeybee_Honeybee.py#L912-L972) The parsing logic within these functions is only compatible with the basic Radiance primitive format documented in page 4 of the [Radiance File Formats](http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/filefmts.pdf).\n\n**modifier type identifier**\n\n**n S1 S2 S3 ..Sn**\n\n**0**\n\n**m R1 R2 R3 ..Rm**\n\n\n\nAliases, which are mentioned in Page 5 of the same document, are not implemented in Honeybee. In the Grasshopper scheme of things, it is easier to implement a simple script that swaps out the name of the original (stored) material with the name of material in the scene.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 3, 2017 at 7:43pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1744249", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1745421"}
