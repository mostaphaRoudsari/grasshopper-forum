{"body": "\nDear ladybug community,\n\n\n\nI am reading since 3 years the topics in this community and it was always very helpfull. But today I am facing an issue, which I cant solve by simple googleing...\n\n\n\nI ran a Radiation analysis with the ladybug component. It worked great, but now I need to place it into a PDF presentation.\u00a0\n\nThe \"bakeit_\" input of the radiation component seemed to be the right choice, but I am recieving the following error:\n\n\n\n\"1. Solution exception:global name 'projectName' is not defined\"\n\n\n\nPicture of my definition is attatched.\n\nWould be great if somebody can give me a hand with this.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1743238", "name": "Radiation error.png"}], "created_by_name": "Ben Slos", "created_at": "April 30, 2017 at 06:57AM", "created_by": "BenSlos", "topic": "Ladybug Radiation Analysis - Bake Error \"'projectName' is not defined\"", "id": "topic_1743236"}
