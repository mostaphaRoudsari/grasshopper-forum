{"body": "\nI still think that the result won't be affected. From the radiation you get it doesn't matter if you have one window of 10 m2 or 10 windows of 1 m2.\n\nIt may affect daylight if you happen to put the sensor just behind the opaque envelope instead behind the window, since you have up to 2 sensors in E+.\n\nIn E+ you can model the geometry of the thermal mass (as is the case of the component i mentioned) or define an area (or volume) of it. This can make a difference.\n\nAgree that the looks may be more appealing if you show the openings but the results will be similar.\n\nI suggest you test with just a few windows (say 4) and one concentrated and see what you get.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 30, 2016 at 01:15AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519106", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1519425"}
