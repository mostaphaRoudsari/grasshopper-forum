{"body": "\nHello again,\n\nI tried to use idf file created by DesignBuilder and imported that idf file to HB. The geometry is imported much nicer and cleaner. However, energyplus simulation crashes in HB.\u00a0\n\nWhen I use \"find Adjacency\" tool, it fails and I am not pretty sure why.\n\nWould you please tell me if I can make this clean file work or should I give up on importing idf from Revit totally?\n\n\n\nThanks\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 28, 2016 at 4:13pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647745", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647762"}
