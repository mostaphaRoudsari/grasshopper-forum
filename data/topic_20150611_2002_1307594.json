{"body": "\nHi all ,\u00a0\n\nI'm working hardly to finish my master's thesis , but stuck in the case study's energy simulation . I'm trying to have air temperature charts of building zones &amp; don't have problem with the main building but when I'm connecting the outer kinetic facade the simulation stops as in the attached pic .\n\nI made the outer facade as a zone as a first trail \u00a0&amp; couldn't have results . and made as shading device as second trail but can't have results also . so I need to know what is the problem with my file ?\u00a0\n\nnote :\u00a0\n\nI need to have results when the facade closed &amp; 50% opened &amp; 100%opened . so it's important to make the outer facade a part of the main building .\u00a0\n\n\u00a0If any one can help me so please find attached my case study file .&amp; Thank you In advance :)\n\nRegards,\u00a0\n\nMona Rezq\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1307593", "name": "Untitled.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "mona rezk", "created_at": "June 11, 2015 at 08:02PM", "created_by": "monarezk", "topic": "urgent , connecting kinetic facade problem", "id": "topic_1307594"}
