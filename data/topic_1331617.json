{"body": "\nAs a part of my research/dissertation-work I am writing custom modules to include some Radiance components, in addition to what is present in Honeybee, into my workflow. I noticed that the Honeybee source code employs Popen as well as a windows batch files. Is there a specific reason to use one over the other in Grasshopper?\n\nI have a fairly decent understanding of Radiance and Python but I haven't used Grasshopper enough to be aware of any issues that it might have with IronPython/Ghpython integration. So, any inputs from the veteran developers on this forum would be of great help.
