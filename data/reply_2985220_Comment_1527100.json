{"body": "\nHi\u00a0[djordje](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topic/listForContributor?user=2h2kxq6q1lacq)!\n\n<br/>Thank you for your answer and sorry for replaying just now.\n\nAs you said, the problem was the lack of HOY in the \"Thermal Comfort Indices\" component. I guessed that that was the problem, but I couldn't find the way to connect the \"ExtremeHotWeek\" output of \"importStat\" component in the previous one (I still have some problems in managing the Data Tree).<br/><br/>As regards the air temperature thing: well, as you said my work is just an academic exercise, so I don't really need to calculate very accurate values, but anyway thank you for having noticed it :)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Scarpati", "created_at": "May 10, 2016 at 4:52am", "created_by": "FrancescoScarpati", "parent_id": "topic_1521933", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1527100"}
