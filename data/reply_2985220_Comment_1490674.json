{"body": "\nThanks Chris, this is all fantastic and resolves the issue of Window insertion. Although I haven't had a great need to use rotated glazing systems within Therm, I understand the importance of allowing this functionality.\n\n\n\nOne further question that has come up in our experiments relates to the creation of Therm materials directly in Grasshopper. The frame cavity materials in the default Therm library have properties related to the cavity itself, such as 'Gas Fill' and 'Cavity Model' which define how the cavity is considered in the final analysis.\n\n\n\nIt would be interesting to know if these properties could be added to the properties that are defined in material creation in Grasshopper, so that both solids and cavities could be created from scratch.\n\n\n\nThanks again for the prompt response!\n\nMike\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mike", "created_at": "March 23, 2016 at 4:43am", "created_by": "Mike185", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490583", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490674"}
