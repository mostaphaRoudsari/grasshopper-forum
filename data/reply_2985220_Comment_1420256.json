{"body": "\nHi Hamed,\n\nThank you for reporting the issue. Fortunately it was only a mistake in the input description. The code was written as expected:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/w9Yv73A6XmCj*Rc9co81OU8QaiMMQZ1MKCLACiFaGwKI90rWseuwUH8OqLKCOSQUWfUTg8escJrRD-5Wa9IxrS23Q8lZOhgu/CDD_HDD.JPG\" width=\"543\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/w9Yv73A6XmCj*Rc9co81OU8QaiMMQZ1MKCLACiFaGwKI90rWseuwUH8OqLKCOSQUWfUTg8escJrRD-5Wa9IxrS23Q8lZOhgu/CDD_HDD.JPG)\n\n\n\nThe descriptions are also fixed now:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/w9Yv73A6XmBu4K0t0Lp5ISgegh9cpVzFzj1U10ra5ollOJME5Gp*2YCpBy3S-tQrhAYOf5UCS2wvqkVDxhsi41QHuGxpkPrs/description.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/w9Yv73A6XmBu4K0t0Lp5ISgegh9cpVzFzj1U10ra5ollOJME5Gp*2YCpBy3S-tQrhAYOf5UCS2wvqkVDxhsi41QHuGxpkPrs/description.JPG)\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if the values are also part of your discussion but Ladybug's base temperatures are selected based on [arguably] comfort temperature range and not ASHRAE. As you have probably already know you can adjust them by changing the input values.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 12, 2015 at 11:39am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1420053", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1420256"}
