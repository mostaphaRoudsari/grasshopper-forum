{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI'm pretty new to Grasshopper and Honeybee and I'm trying to run a daylight/energy analysis for custom shading. I want to calculate heat gain with the E+ analysis putting my shading in as context shading.\n\n\n\nThe analysis runs fine without the shading, but as soon as I connect the context shading component it fails. I've tried using some other breps as shading just to check if the problem is my shading geometry (is it possible that it's just too complicated?), however, so far, the only thing that worked was a plain cube.\n\nIf I aditionally connect a transparency schedule, even that fails. Depending on what I tried, I got all different kinds of warnings, so I don't really know what to do anymore.\n\n\n\nI've attached the file with the analysis. Hopefully somebody here can help me out.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1410046", "name": "Analyse Alu ohne Versatz eplus.gh"}], "created_by_name": "S221B", "created_at": "November 26, 2015 at 4:06am", "created_by": "S221B", "topic": "Problems with Honeybee E+ context shading component", "id": "topic_1410047"}
