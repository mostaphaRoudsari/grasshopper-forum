{"body": "\nFor some reason when I used the userCustomLibrary to add new schedules to honeybee, the idf file that was written wrote some parts in the wrong lines.\n\n\n\nWould you be able to direct me to the documentation that explains the way userCustomLibrary works, as I assume it must write the added objects to a master template file? I cannot find the names of the new schedules in any of the master template idf files which are within the ladybug directory, so cannot check if it has simply copied the objects wrong.\n\n\n\nI've attached the idf testing file which had been written. The schedules have all been written over well, but for some reason one of the added schedules via userCustomLibrary has found itself in amongst the ScheduleLimitTypes of the idf file?\n\n\n\nCould this be because honeybee works with version 8.1 and we have 8.2 installed at the university as the EnergyPlus version?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1338435", "name": "Office_Test.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "August 4, 2015 at 10:50pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1336060", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1338434"}
