{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI am having trouble with this new wonderful tool that allows adding a group of windows to various zones. Everything seems to go well until I run the E+ simulation and it abort calculation because a lot of severe errors with the window geometry and zones recognition, so I guess the problem occur when adding multiple child surfaces. \u00a0\n\nI tried changing individual windows for WWR and works well. That until I update the components of the file. Now is giving an error too.\n\nPlease, it will be very appreciated if anybody can give me a hand with this.\n\nFind detailed explanations to the GH model; I tried to make it as clear as possible.\n\nAlthough the geometry was internalised, I add the rhino model, just to see if you can give me an extra clue about how adding internal child surfaces with this new method (adding multiples child surfaces), since Chris\u2019s method is not applicable in this example.\n\nKind Regards\n\nJavier\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1330233", "name": "07_RhinoModel.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1330234", "name": "07_RunWithErrors.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Javier", "created_at": "July 21, 2015 at 7:47pm", "created_by": "Javier387", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1316675", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1330231"}
