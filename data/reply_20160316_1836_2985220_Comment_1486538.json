{"body": "\nHi Colin,\n\nNice to see you on the forums!\n\nIt's difficult to know exactly what is going on without having the GH file. \u00a0If you upload the file on this thread, we can re-create the situation on our own machines and help you more precisely.\n\nIn the meantime, I can tell you that, if you are using the \"Run Simulation\" component and the ideal air system, I am certain that you will be able to use the existing components get the controls working in a manner that gives you results that make sense. \u00a0In particular, you should check out the \"Set EnergyPlus Loads\" component, the \"Set EnergyPlus Schedules\" component, and (most importantly) the \"Set Ideal Air Loads Parameters\" components. \u00a0Also, requesting zoneHVACParams on the \"Generate EP Output\" component and using the \"Read EP HVAC Result\" component will give you some more outputs to help debug your model:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fOv0QAWOziitSpsO1qqpoAFgbw82mY5CdLeDvZ5FtUCzcBjibLP87fm9RLA5m80oONRV7HjE8BrryWRwymwpyqAzh6Fkf5t*/DebuggingIdealAirSystem.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fOv0QAWOziitSpsO1qqpoAFgbw82mY5CdLeDvZ5FtUCzcBjibLP87fm9RLA5m80oONRV7HjE8BrryWRwymwpyqAzh6Fkf5t*/DebuggingIdealAirSystem.JPG)\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 16, 2016 at 06:36PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1486519", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1486538"}
