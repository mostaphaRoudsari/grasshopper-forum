{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\n\n\niam new to honeybee and ladybug! When i try to launch honeybee the honeybee icon in grasshopper is highlighted red and always prompts this error message:\n\nI reinstalled honeybee and ladybug and followed the installation instructions line by line. Nothing changed. So i tried to figure out the problem and found this discussion. I read the messages and tried every possible solution mentioned in this thread, but nothing changed.\n\n\n\nI attached an image of the output of the honeybee_honeybee_DEC_08.gh file\n\nMostapha replied to another user: <br/>\n\n\"that this might be a permission issue and happening for the same reason. Let's do this. If you check output of Ladybug_Ladybug component it should tell you where the default folder is set to. It can be C:\\Ladybug or\u00a0C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ladybug\\. Can you check and see if the folder is already created? If not can you create it and let the Honeybee fly again?\n\nI tried this but honeybee didn't fly!\n\nAnother reason that I can think of is the %USERNAME% on your system. Hopefully it doesn't have a white space.\"\n\nCan somebody please help me solving this problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1306437", "name": "Error message.png"}], "created_by_name": "Sigi Streitfelder", "created_at": "June 9, 2015 at 11:03am", "created_by": "SigiStreitfelder", "topic": "Honeybee Runtime Error: Win32Exception", "id": "topic_1306438"}
