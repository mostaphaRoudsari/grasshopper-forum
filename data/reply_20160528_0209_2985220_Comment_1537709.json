{"body": "\nHi Fransesco,\n\n\n\nThat sounds good! I'll pass my email over and we can coordinate more on this.\n\n\n\nI do understand the timeframe of CFD simulations no worries. The workflow we are working on also includes CFD simulations, using the open source OpenFOAM software. Given my usual hectic schedule, and depending on the size of your model, I think that it would take a few days to find a slot and run it.\n\n\n\nThe LB/HB part of the workflow comes after that and utilises the point wind velocities the CFD simulation provides.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTherefore, we can either compare that to your workflow utilising Envi-met or if Envi-met gives wind velocities (I must admit I'm mostly ignorant to its details) then we can also try and see how to insert that data to the workflow.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 28, 2016 at 02:09AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537705", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1537709"}
