{"body": "\nHi Devang,\n\nI tried to run the galapagos component in order to optimize the amount of lux inside my classroom. I linked the genome and the fitness as in figure, defining as threshold 300 lux (which is the maximum reachable for my class).\n\nAfter one night of running, this is the result (which again seems zero), could be the same problem of the unrecognized window?\n\nhow can I obtain some visible results?\n\n\n\nI attach the gh file and the pic of the galapagos so you can understand better (I switch off all the component so it doesn't take to long when you open it).\n\nThank you very much,\u00a0your kind assistance on this is very\u00a0much appreciated.\n\n\n\nCarlie\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1672831", "name": "galapagos1.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1672832", "name": "Daylight_analysis_CS_gala.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Carlie_3", "created_at": "January 16, 2017 at 2:13am", "created_by": "Carlie_3", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1672370", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1672830"}
