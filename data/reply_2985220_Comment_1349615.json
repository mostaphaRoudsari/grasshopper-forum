{"body": "\nFahimeh,\n\n\n\nIts possible for a space to be in a cooling mode during the winter. E+\u00a0balances the following loads:\n\n-solar heat gain\n\n-heat transfer through the glass\n\n-heat transfer through all other facades\n\n-internal program loads (people, plug loads, electric lighting, etc.)\n\n-infiltration\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe heat transfer through the glass/faced and infiltration will be positive or negative depending on the exterior condition, but the internal loads and solar gain will always be positive. If the internal loads and solar loads are greater than the fa\u00e7ade heat transfer and infiltration loss, you will need to cool the space.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI recommend reviewing each of the loads listed above, particularly the internal loads settings. It is likely that one of these is too high, resulting in cooling all year.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "August 26, 2015 at 10:46am", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "parent_id": "topic_1349292", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1349615"}
