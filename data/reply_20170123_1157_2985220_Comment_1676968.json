{"body": "\nFirst, thanks a lot to all the people who worked on Ladybug/Honeybee all these years, you made it wonderful !\n\n\n\nCurrently developing the use of these software in my company, i think that there could be several ways of simplifying things, especially for newcomers like me :\n\n- correct some (or all) descriptions ! some small mistakes here and there put together can be very misleading for people like me at the beginning.\n\nOn the same level, maybe a guide/explanation on some parts could be nice (if it does exist, i'm interested :)). For instance i found controls for ventilation &amp; lighting quite hard to play with at first compared to other tools because of the lack of info on this.\n\n\u00a0\n\n- It might be a WIP, but a tool to add/change some parameters could be nice. For instance temperature control based on operative T\u00b0 instead of air T\u00b0 or other very small things like that that could lead to a perfect customizable tool !\n\n\n\n- Other small things:\n\ncomponent to add surface properties to shading/context geometries.\n\nif possible: get the losses trough the envelope of the building to add to the energy balance.\n\nchange only one surface of an existing HBzone (maybe it is possible now actually)\n\n\n\nAgain, thanks for the great work you did with all this !\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aurelien Keller", "created_at": "January 23, 2017 at 11:57AM", "created_by": "AurelienKeller", "parent_id": "topic_1677014", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1676968"}
