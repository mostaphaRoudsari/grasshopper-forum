{"body": "\nHi everyone,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI've been having some problems with the false color image renderer. I can't figure out why it is generating invalid images (only 1kb in size).\u00a0\n\nI'm including a the gh definition.\u00a0\n\nControls are on the upper left corner.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEverything else works fine, the image based simulation does render out a scene and is can be converted to GIF.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI've also included copies of the original HDR and the 1kb false color HDR.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any ideas.\u00a0\n\nThank you,\u00a0\n\n\n\nMauricio\u00a0[<br/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ZNt8FIknlRNhk*N2bYiscWFcRbJYBXbzxAayFcR97QaWGI347BZev4zJ8mP8Lc3xDGQdtYT8zhPEgqda2iAGQ4weVXpBR0za/GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC.epw)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1322040", "name": "FalseColor.rar"}], "created_by_name": "Mauricio Aguilar Cardenas", "created_at": "July 08, 2015 at 05:30AM", "created_by": "MauricioAguilarCardenas135", "topic": "False Color Not Generating Valid Images", "id": "topic_1322041"}
