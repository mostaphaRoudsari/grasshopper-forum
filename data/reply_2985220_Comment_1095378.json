{"body": "\nHi Ding-\n\n\n\nSo in my experience, there are very few tools that import both geometry and schedules/constructions from gbXML. \u00a0Nearly every tool I am aware of only imports geometry. \u00a0Because of this, in the first release, we have been more concerned with exporting geometry and focusing on schedules and constructions for future releases.\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of known bugs related to schedules in grizzlybear currently, which I am in the process of correcting.\n\n\n\nI would be surprised if DesignBuilder takes schedules and constructions from gbXML.\n\n\n\nAs for your second question. \u00a0You ask about converting gbXML to XML. \u00a0I'm not sure what format DB wants for this...gbXML is XML, so I also think we need to wait to hear back from design builder. \u00a0Currently I certainly am not intending to build a plug in specifically to import a special XML format into design builder only.\n\n\n\nAre you still having trouble with GrizzlyBear?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chien Si Harriman", "created_at": "June 30, 2014 at 9:38am", "created_by": "ChienSiHarriman", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1101608", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1095378"}
