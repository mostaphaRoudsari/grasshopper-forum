{"body": "\nDear All,\n\nI'd appreciate it if you could reply the following questions:\n\n\n\n1- A building code requires:\u00a0Thermal Transmittance (Summer U value)\u00a0U= 1.9 **W/m2K** (max) for glazing elements performance.\n\nI'm wondering what number to assign to the \"_U_Value\" input of the EPWindowMat\u00a0component. The Honeybee hint tells that it should represent the conductivity of the window in **W/mK**, and it refers to NFRC's U Factor under winter conditions.**<br/>**\n\nOn the other hand\u00a0[here](http://www.nfrccommunity.org/blogpost/925129/226115/Understanding-Window-U-Factor) NFRC defines: \"U-factor indicates how much energy will be lost from a building through its windows by specifying how many **BTU**s can pass through one **square foot** of material in an **hour**.\"<br/> <br/> I'm a bit confused what unit and what number to assign.\n\n\n\n2- By knowing a Summer U Value, is it possible to estimate the Winter one?\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nA\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1795167", "name": "UValue.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Aryan Shahabian", "created_at": "August 7, 2017 at 10:55am", "created_by": "AryanShahabian", "topic": "EPWindowMat U Value", "id": "topic_1795164"}
