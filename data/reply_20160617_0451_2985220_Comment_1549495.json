{"body": "\nHi Guys. I have a question regarding the PVGen component.\n\n\n\n&gt; The old component had the surface area input, the current version doesn't have it. How do I input/check the SA of each component?\n\n\n\n&gt; I'm not sure if I understood NoParallel and NoSeries correctly. Do they refer to the number of components x-axis and y-axis (respectively, or the other way around?). Since I don't know the SA for each component, how do I calculate the number of components to be placed on the x and y-axis?\n\n\n\n&gt;Regarding the power output per module, is it in Watts/m^2?\n\n\n\nThanks.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pin", "created_at": "June 17, 2016 at 04:51AM", "created_by": "Pin", "parent_id": "topic_1350615", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1549495"}
