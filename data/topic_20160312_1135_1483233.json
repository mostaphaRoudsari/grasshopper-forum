{"body": "\nDear All,\n\nIs there a way to take-off average daylight results in LB+HB instead of hourly based results ?\n\n\n\ncause i'm trying to study more than 100 different parametric openings and their effect on daylight values so it will take me a veeery long time to study each of the window sizes on each hour every single day in a whole year. i know its not accurate to take the average but at least it can limit the options that i should consider.\n\n\n\nThanks and appreciated.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ataur Rahman", "created_at": "March 12, 2016 at 11:35AM", "created_by": "AtaurRahman", "topic": "Average Daylight Results ?", "id": "topic_1483233"}
