{"body": "\nHi,\n\nJust to strenghten Chris's comments and without checking the files. Radiance simulations are stochastic , so there is a factor of randomness in the simulations. That's why the same simulation can give slightly different results. There are plenty of comments on this. Not sure that in this forum, but for sure in others.\n\nSo if this is the case, i'll be fine with this 0.2% difference for the same parameters.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 22, 2015 at 09:05PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1347417", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1347340"}
