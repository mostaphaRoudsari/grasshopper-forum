{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\ndoing the test I see that some IES files are not converted by the new component. I mean that ies2hb creates a batch file in the folder without make it running. If I execute it, however, it creates the file (*.rad &amp; *.dat) and everything goes ok. Actually I have no idea about where the problem is: the command in Python looks fine but I'm not good at programming [line 175: runCmdAndGetTheResults( \"/c \" + batchFilePath)\u00a0].\n\nIn addition to this I guess that creating an input (domain 0 -&gt; 1) able to modify the multiplier parameter in the IES file before the conversion to the radiance format would make it complete.\n\nI have attached the IES file to let you try how it runs.\n\n\n\nlet me know your thought,\n\nClaudio\n\n\n\nPS: the IES attached is taken from\u00a0[http://www.zumtobel.com/com-en/products/1338.html?42915795](http://www.zumtobel.com/com-en/products/1338.html?42915795) . It is also quite curious how the component creates two polygons where is applied the light material.\n\n\n\nI have found some interesting data sheets about IES file format:\n\n[http://www.ltblight.com/English.lproj/LTBLhelp/pages/iesformat.html](http://www.ltblight.com/English.lproj/LTBLhelp/pages/iesformat.html)\n\n[http://www.cn-hopu.com/upload/file/IES.pdf](http://www.cn-hopu.com/upload/file/IES.pdf)\n\n[http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2013/ENU/index.html?url=files/GUID-45C...](http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2013/ENU/index.html?url=files/GUID-45CAAF1C-7C9D-49A7-B18D-00CA5E2ED380.htm,topicNumber=d30e153989)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1054574", "name": "42915795_(STD).IES"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio Campanile", "created_at": "April 22, 2014 at 11:09AM", "created_by": "ClaudioCampanile", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1049875", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1054573"}
