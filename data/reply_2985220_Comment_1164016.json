{"body": "\nLudvig,\n\nYou could set up a Honeybee Energy simulation and plug in the \"infiltrationLossGain\" to the annual hourly data of the wind rose. \u00a0That infiltration loss/gain will show you the hourly heat gained or lost to the zone by infiltration, which seems to be what you are interested in. \u00a0You could then use the conditional statement to select the hours when this infiltration loss is the worst. \u00a0That's the best way that I would think of it.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 7, 2014 at 10:31am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1163763", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1164016"}
