{"body": "\nHi all, hi Chris,\n\n\n\nI am in trouble with the Honeybee_Solve Adjacencies component (the connection between internal zone and a ground floor) and i was not able to find the error in the workflow. There is something in the model that i cannot recognize as an error. Can someone help me? I am going crazy. The reed baloon says just this \"1. Solution exception:bce01e33-8f6a-46ac-8de9-d1d1f728b0d0\".\n\n\n\nAttached you can find the file with all the data internalized.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nBest,\u00a0\n\nAngelo\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1734360", "name": "Outdoor_Microclimate_Map_5_SIMPLIFIED.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Angelo Figliola", "created_at": "April 17, 2017 at 08:29AM", "created_by": "AngeloFigliola", "topic": "Problem with Honeybee_Solve Adjacencies component", "id": "topic_1734361"}
