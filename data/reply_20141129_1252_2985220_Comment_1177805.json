{"body": "\nHi Daniel,\u00a0Thank you for the reply.\n\n\n\nMy experience with gbXML hasn't been that good. It is usually supposed to carry the data but in reality it doesn't! At least output from Revit/Vasari doesn't include data for constructions. The one that you can download from GBS does. This project came out recently that should ease the process of converting xml &lt;&gt; idf to each other:\u00a0[https://github.com/MarcusJones/EnergyParser](https://github.com/MarcusJones/EnergyParser)\n\n\n\nYou are right about the gap and I can also see that in the model that you posted on github.\n\n\n\nWell, I'm not sure why people do it but maybe since it is easier to customize your model with Honeybee, or visualize the results.\n\n\n\nFor now I fixed idfImport component so one can import idf file as Honeybee objects, modify the model and run it in Grasshopper and visualize the results. In this example I change construction for glazing. The process doesn't input data related to systems. It imports geometry, materials and constructions. It imports schedules but don't assign them to zones. That should be an easy fix for later.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/alJLWH62eMTWJhyCFI28pirIrglfe2vJsKdcoY4jH9HzLK6V-l9pjp1gxOua0DfnFRnksbyerG952mNyiLL8yx4hl0aAyVlV/importIdf_toHoneybee.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/alJLWH62eMTWJhyCFI28pirIrglfe2vJsKdcoY4jH9HzLK6V-l9pjp1gxOua0DfnFRnksbyerG952mNyiLL8yx4hl0aAyVlV/importIdf_toHoneybee.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1177807", "name": "importIdf.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 29, 2014 at 12:52PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1177750", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1177805"}
