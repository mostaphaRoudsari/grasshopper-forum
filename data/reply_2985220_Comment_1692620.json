{"body": "\nHi Jeremy,\n\n\n\nI have checked your file and it should work fine.<br/>Firstly, I suggest that you update your LB version, the last one is 0.0.64.\u00a0(Feb).\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2BC2RpaeA-iqpFyuT5TVhs4RMPUdIMNSHraKv53XCI-4dtWsvFmNqTkKJZOcy3I3rkFhMs01EuGBWOgJtcIyP6B/lb_test_DNA.png?width=450\" width=\"450\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2BC2RpaeA-iqpFyuT5TVhs4RMPUdIMNSHraKv53XCI-4dtWsvFmNqTkKJZOcy3I3rkFhMs01EuGBWOgJtcIyP6B/lb_test_DNA.png)\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2Dr6Rh56ek61gOfbOYdCZVjkkm1GHdMnSuZDD4SLS0t0stf5KuqjkOlSUbnOh4FTvpBXivR5samtg326Lhjdett/lb_test_DNA_2.png?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KZdONCIBf2Dr6Rh56ek61gOfbOYdCZVjkkm1GHdMnSuZDD4SLS0t0stf5KuqjkOlSUbnOh4FTvpBXivR5samtg326Lhjdett/lb_test_DNA_2.png)\n\n\n\nThere are two things you should to do when you use LB sunlightHours:<br/>1) check the direction of analysis surfaces, sometimes it doesn't work because they are flipped.<br/>2) when the model is huge like this one, try to simplify it. If it is not possible, try with a part of it and when you are sure and all it is fine, run the complete model. Moreover, for the first tests of your model I suggest that you use a big gridSize, e.g. 10 meters.\n\n\n\nLet me know if it works\n\n\n\n- Antonello\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1692622", "name": "LB_sunLightHours_DNA.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "February 15, 2017 at 3:00pm", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "topic_1691433", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1692620"}
