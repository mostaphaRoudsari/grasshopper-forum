{"body": "\nHi Yassin,\n\n\n\nI read your research paper 'Optimizing Creatively in Multi-objective Optimization' and I find it really interesting. Being able to compare the form as shown the image from your research (attached) is really really useful. Would you please be able to explain in more detail how you managed to get the different forms colored based on their performance?\u00a0\n\nThanks so much for your help.\n\nDan\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/p9ey71ICjWdsWRlb0b9oRU15cdUmnl1FDB7eJyO-xuBrA*0BZTxtBFRAlg3QcnDmUUoJ8T5SZB5cgAYa5YnQV5MKfKAbuSiU/YassinAshourresearchpaperscreenshot.JPG\" width=\"580\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/p9ey71ICjWdsWRlb0b9oRU15cdUmnl1FDB7eJyO-xuBrA*0BZTxtBFRAlg3QcnDmUUoJ8T5SZB5cgAYa5YnQV5MKfKAbuSiU/YassinAshourresearchpaperscreenshot.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Danijel Rusovan", "created_at": "February 12, 2016 at 9:18am", "created_by": "DanijelRusovan", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1229685", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1461734"}
