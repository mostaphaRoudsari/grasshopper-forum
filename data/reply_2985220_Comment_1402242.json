{"body": "\nHi Vinu, Anton,\n\n\n\nI have been following the post with great interest since I have been trying to set up a remote analysis using multiple analysis on the background of network desktop. Unfortunately I cannot get the simulations to run neither on the network machines nor on my local desktop. Could you please upload the last successful definition maybe? You only used the .idf's created by the \"runEnergySimulaiton\" component without running it?\u00a0\n\n\n\nthank you for opening up this discussion by the way. It is very helpful so far.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "November 17, 2015 at 9:32am", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1404023", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1402242"}
