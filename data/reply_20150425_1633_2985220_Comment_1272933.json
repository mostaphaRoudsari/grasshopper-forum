{"body": "\nHi,<br/><br/>I have just checked\u00a0White Box Technologies website, and looks like I was wrong.<br/>Historical weather data is an 8760 hour record of weather data for particular year. So when they say \"year range from 2001 to 2012\" it literally means they have an hourly annual data for each of 2001 to 2012 years. I would say that this kind of data is not suited for simulations we are performing.<br/>On composite year historical data, you can't simply concatenate months from different years. [Users Manual for TMY3 Data Sets](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43156.pdf), section \"2 Procedures for Developing TMY3\" provides an insight into different methods by which months from particular years were picked and concatenated to form TMY datasets.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "April 25, 2015 at 04:33PM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1272124", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1272933"}
