{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nThe ladybug radiation analysis does not include any ambient bounces and so it should only be used in outdoor cases where there is not a lot of complex or deeply self-shading geometry (it seems like you are skirting the line here). \u00a0The Honeybee radiation analysis is effectively the same exact thing as Ladybug but with the ability to have several ambient bounces and I imagine that this is the reason for the difference between your two types of geometry. \u00a0I am getting pretty comparable results between the two simulations:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/14StazH4QF5kSZEEGXOvLAByEAFHFgXbXkSASSxs4OgU-HoING7VKQj6resAFlT6GjJ62ZGtl1qhNy8FZhTQ5xZgFhSENskj/ComparableResults.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/14StazH4QF5kSZEEGXOvLAByEAFHFgXbXkSASSxs4OgU-HoING7VKQj6resAFlT6GjJ62ZGtl1qhNy8FZhTQ5xZgFhSENskj/ComparableResults.JPG)\n\nThe annual daylight analysis is only calculating illuminance and other daylight metrics derived from illumionance (not radiation). \u00a0Annual analysis with Honeybee should really only be used to evaluate daylight on the interiors of buildings since illuminance is not a very useful metric in outdoor conditions (generally, you have good light if the sun is out). \u00a0In your file, you have 3896 test points. \u00a0For each of these test points, you are trying to import 8760 values of illuminance for each hour of the year. \u00a0This means that you are effectively bringing in:\n\n3,896 x 8,760 = 34,128,960\n\ndata values, each of which is ~ 6 digits long. \u00a0I imagine that 34 million 6-digit numbers would max out the memory of all except a super computer and so I would recommend narrowing your test region to just an interior floor of the building.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 9, 2015 at 6:33pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1376434", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1376484"}
