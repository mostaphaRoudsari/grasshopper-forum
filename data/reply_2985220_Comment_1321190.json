{"body": "\nHi Vinu,\n\n1. To clarify with the sill height, this input works on a surface-by-surface basis and is not absolute to the zone (that could easily create conditions where the input glazing ratio did not match the actual geometric glazing ratio produced).\n\nYou probably want to use the addHBGlz component for your case and make a custom window surface (perhaps doing so parametrically with native GH components if you still want to be able to change the glazing ratio). \u00a0I think this addHBGlz component will be particularly helpful if you sync with the Honeybee github since Mostapha just put in the capability to plug in an entire zone to this component a few days ago. \u00a0Now that you can plug in an whole zone and the component will automatically figure out which surface of the zone the window should be belong to. \u00a0Immensely useful for cases like yours.\n\n2. Are you looking to evaluate the effect of the blinds on thermal performance or on daylight?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 6, 2015 at 8:32pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1321100", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1321190"}
