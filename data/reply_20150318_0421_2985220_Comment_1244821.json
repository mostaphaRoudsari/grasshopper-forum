{"body": "\nHello again Mostapha,\n\nI developed a simple model with basic settings to check again the\u00a0lightingControlGroups feature of the\u00a0Honeybee_Read Annual Result I. But it doesn't work yet, as you can see from the print of the Daysim report there is only one lighting group result. Hope you can tell me what's wrong in it.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/afJNJUtdOc6xh23z92jwP9Zz47qM3Dav2HumiTJXQXMbodSnKFZG6QW267LkDm2KZNYyC-AV0JRbP4A3Hp4ZBjf*M78ier1N/DaysimSimulationReport.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/afJNJUtdOc6xh23z92jwP9Zz47qM3Dav2HumiTJXQXMbodSnKFZG6QW267LkDm2KZNYyC-AV0JRbP4A3Hp4ZBjf*M78ier1N/DaysimSimulationReport.jpg)\n\n\n\nI made a simple box room, and I divided the room in three lighting groups using as sensor points for the three lighting groups three groups of test points. You can see in the Rhino screenshot the red, yellow and blue points.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/afJNJUtdOc7mcKKqGcbAfeQq3V5mH7c*kp2RYQ*c9vyRzNhPK3VSPmk6kFkJAfIbGM-uQo4rW296cxkphzl4Sp2CjsUoSM*v/room.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/afJNJUtdOc7mcKKqGcbAfeQq3V5mH7c*kp2RYQ*c9vyRzNhPK3VSPmk6kFkJAfIbGM-uQo4rW296cxkphzl4Sp2CjsUoSM*v/room.jpg)\n\n\n\nYou can check the definition screenshot and the gh file I attach (this is also for Lu Xiangting that was asking for files)\u00a0so you can tell me what is going wrong.
