{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\nAt this moment i would say that if you receive any results, take them as garbage :-)\n\nI would recommend you to master the technique you are trying to do with a simple box. It will be a lot easier to understand where the problems are.\n\nAs for your model, as far as i checked the main issue i see is this. E+ walls host the windows. The size of the windows CAN'T cover the whole wall. You need to leave even a very small part of the wall, but never cover it all with the window. You need to leave a frame (all 4 margins) of wall. Your window parts are covering the whole wall, so i think this is the main reason this is not working. But, again, maybe there are more reasons, but you need to fix this first.\n\nAlso check you are not having \"extended\" walls. I've noticed one corner where the wall extends beyond the limits. This is not critical, though.\n\nGood luck,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 03, 2015 at 01:11AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1235347", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1235266"}
