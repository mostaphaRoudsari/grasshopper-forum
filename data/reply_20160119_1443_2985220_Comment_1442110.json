{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you for the quick response! Unfortunately I am still having the same issue, the error message says \"Solution Exception: Index out of range: 7\". As someone very new to coding, this error is alien to me...\n\n\n\nIn reassigning the inputs, I find that it only comes up with that error when I connect the HBZones. The computer is able to do parrallel processing, the only difference I might be able to note is that we have 8.2 and not 8.3 but I don't recall that being essential for this analysis...\n\n\n\nUnsure why my zones would cause an issue as well, since there is only one at this stage. I will experiment a bit more, but I donnot know what that error message is meaning.\n\n\n\nCheers, Elly\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 19, 2016 at 02:43PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1441303", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1442110"}
