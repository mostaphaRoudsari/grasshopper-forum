{"body": "\nThanks for taking a look at this Chris. (Thanks also for the ctrl+B tip!) \u00a0I've spent a few hours testing the revised component and I'm having a hard time understanding the results. \u00a0I'm still finding that adding the economizer makes almost no difference in the cooling energy use.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HoverOver description for the modulateFloworTemp parameter is confusing, but after looking at the IDF files, here is how I understand what you've done:\n\nmodulateFlow = True: sets Outdoor Air Method to \"None.\"\n\nmodulateFlow = False:\u00a0sets Outdoor Air Method to \"Maximum.\"\n\nairSideEconomizer = True: sets\u00a0Cooling Limit to \"LimitFlowRate,\" Maximum Cooling to \"autosize,\" and Economizer Type to \"DifferentialDryBulb.\"\n\nairSideEconomizer = False: sets\u00a0Cooling Limit to \"NoLimit,\" and Economizer Type to \"blank.\"\n\n\n\nFirst, I found that when the Outdoor Air Method set to None, the Economizer is not available so coupling the Economizer with your \"VAV\" method yields no difference in the results.\n\n\n\nSecond, I'm baffled by the results when the modulateFlow is False and the airSideEconomizer is True. \u00a0I'm seeing the ventilation airflow increase (compared to no Economizer) but the cooling energy remain identical.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/njfi925B3DBCBIs0XrX*ofoiX947B3xV5Axrf*x7IdHHPQYbw*zXOOONZz7OElKFuoSldfwCaU6NaF3Yx2OZa6nShdX361ez/CoolingComparison.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/njfi925B3DBCBIs0XrX*ofoiX947B3xV5Axrf*x7IdHHPQYbw*zXOOONZz7OElKFuoSldfwCaU6NaF3Yx2OZa6nShdX361ez/CoolingComparison.jpg)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/njfi925B3DCjf7kgElPtNIIgmws9MChhdYrb2LvFenKWZSpGxehc20*P2P4hd067RkoK*cfhD*w8vKAY4XwKMtxGzNwbag3y/ACHComparison.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/njfi925B3DCjf7kgElPtNIIgmws9MChhdYrb2LvFenKWZSpGxehc20*P2P4hd067RkoK*cfhD*w8vKAY4XwKMtxGzNwbag3y/ACHComparison.jpg)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/njfi925B3DALmb25PrqQd1PGyMFfay3ISkhkpPN*wjHSWI-ecOSf6kp52OfCURb5xA6iOptBQm6MTZRBZnflZ6xRZFzR1axI/SupplyAirflowComparison.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/njfi925B3DALmb25PrqQd1PGyMFfay3ISkhkpPN*wjHSWI-ecOSf6kp52OfCURb5xA6iOptBQm6MTZRBZnflZ6xRZFzR1axI/SupplyAirflowComparison.jpg)\n\nThird, this doesn't hugely impact the results but as an aside, if you were to use the\u00a0\"Sum\" of the area and occupant ventilation (rather than the Max), it would more closely reflect ASHRAE ventilation requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, forgive me for asking a dumb question, but after updating LB and HB the Ideal Loads Component does not update to the one you attached. \u00a0Is this because your new component isn't committed to github yet?\n\n\n\nSorry for the lengthy response - I hope it helps clarify.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Burin", "created_at": "February 28, 2015 at 04:27PM", "created_by": "Burin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1231170", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1233761"}
