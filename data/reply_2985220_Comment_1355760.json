{"body": "\nHi Mostafa,\n\nI wrote my problem in this link:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/appcrash-error?commentId=...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/appcrash-error?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1355849&amp;xg_source=msg_com_forum)\n\nUnfortunately, David couldn't help me find the problem, at least he suggests waiting to see if it will crashes on Rhinoceros 6 and that's a long time for me.\n\nDo you have any other suggestion for me with this file? Is there any other way to get the results (I want to find the best angle and dimension of a lightshelf in every hour on some specific days). It took a long time for me to learn Hb and it's not logical to leave in this stage inconclusive.<br/>Thanks\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1355761", "name": "5-1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Fahimeh Motazedian", "created_at": "September 6, 2015 at 11:49am", "created_by": "FahimehMotazedian", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1355294", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1355760"}
