{"body": "\nHi Francesco,\n\n\n\nI see what you're talking about. Please make a note that legend changes too when you add the second building. The legend is getting chagend\u00a0due to change in High Bound and Low Bound values. These values will be different in the case of one building and in the case of two buildings. I believe, that's the reason why you have that\u00a0difference in visualization output.\n\n\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "January 10, 2017 at 7:41am", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "topic_1669294", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1669735"}
