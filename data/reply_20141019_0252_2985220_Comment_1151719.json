{"body": "\nHi,\n\nThanks for your both replies.\n\nI get it to work. I added a NONE schedule in my custom definitions.\n\nI have a couple of issues, not exactly related to the discussion subject, but still, i'll write them here.\n\nAttached the file i'm using and my custom definitions IDF, so you can test also.\n\n1. In the isConditioned input i gave a list where one zone is not conditioned and the other 5 are. The ColorZones component is failing (1. Solution exception:index out of range: 5) - see point 5 in the file. The reason is that it is expecting that all zones are conditioned. When i input temperatures (for instance) it works fine. How you suggest to work out this (very) possible situation?\n\n2. Naming and assigning a list for the zones (point 1 in file) in certain order is not consistent with the order i can show the different zones (for instance point 7 in file). Is there a way to have more control in the naming and programing a zone (besides doing one by one)? Or any other suggestion you have for this file wil be welcomed.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1151720", "name": "H_Bldg1.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1151721", "name": "userCustomEPLibrary.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 19, 2014 at 02:52AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151398", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151719"}
