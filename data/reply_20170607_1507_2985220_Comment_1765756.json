{"body": "\nHey Mostapha,\n\nthanks for your reply. I know from the Windows version, that you can simply \u00bbdrag and drop\u00ab Ladybug into your grashopper interface and then you're ready to go. That doesn't work with Mac and I have no idea, how to install it. What are those userobjects you are talking about?\n\nFurthermore, do I have to install Python or is it already included in RhinoWIP?\n\nAlfred\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hoal", "created_at": "June 07, 2017 at 03:07PM", "created_by": "Hoal", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1763906", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1765756"}
