{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha, Chris and group members,\n\n\n\nThe **Ladybug_AnalysisPeriod** component could set a continuous period of time not the discontinuous or separated. So how to set a same period of each day (ex. the 5 a.m to 7 p.m of everyday from June 5th to July 9th), and a certain time during a long period (ex. 12 a.m of every day on June)?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n\nBi Xiaojian\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "January 6, 2017 at 12:33am", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "topic": "Simulation Period Setting", "id": "topic_1667548"}
