{"body": "\nAlso, are there some documentation on Daylight Factor? The simulation works perfectly, it's a really great feature that it support multiple cores and has a quality setting! Priceless when trying out multiple designs. But I cant wrap my head around how to set north and location (or .epw)?\n\n\n\nDaylight factor is a geometrical calculation and won't change based on orientation or climate, that's why you don't have an input for north or epw file.\n\n\n\nFor the rest of daylight simulations (except annual) you can rotate the sky.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 4, 2015 at 8:12pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1243628", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256625"}
