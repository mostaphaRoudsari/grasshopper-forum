{"body": "\nHello Francesco and sorry for taking a while to answer.\n\nRegarding the situation you're describing, I can see it as useful and with the component I sent you or with your solution it's attainable (just a bit more work). Extending the component to act the way you describe might make it a bit complex as it is very specific. The other issue would be that it introduces a degree of freedom. Imagine that you're providing a list of sun vectors and also a specification that a certain facade must receive 4 sun hours. If there are 10 sun hours in the sun vector pool then what does the component do? take the first 4? take the 4 with the biggest altitude angle because that would (probably) create the biggest envelope? look at the radiation and choose the 4 hours with the most radiation? and so on. The user has less control and knowledge as to what actually happens which is something I tried to avoid for this stage.\n\nNow what if we have more than 4 orientations or the building is not aligned to the north? How accurately will the envelope represent the actual requirements then?\n\n\n\nHaving said that, I agree that the user might want to simply say, I want so and so hours or so and so radiation on my facades, give me an envelope which does that, currently it's not as direct.\n\n\n\nRegarding python vs gh, I think that at some point you reach a glass ceiling using just visual programming, but of course it all depends on what you want to do...\n\n\n\ncheers,\n\nboris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Boris Plotnikov", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 02:00PM", "created_by": "BorisPlotnikov", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1407882", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412726"}
