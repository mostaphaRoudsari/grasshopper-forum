{"body": "\nI echo mostapha's comment and this has definitely to do with your mesh. The boundingbox patch is the artificial box Butterfly is adding around your geometry as a background mesh.\n\n\n\nIf you location is **inside** the room and the geometry is closed then the boundingbox should not remain in your patches (or be there with 0 faces which would not be an issue). So you should check either of those things. Visualizing the mesh will let you know where things were bad, most of the times.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 18, 2017 at 03:38AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1734293", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1735048"}
