{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nA few months ago, I made it so that, if you are running the UTCI comfort map with only outdoor surfaces, the only thing that you need from the EnergyPlus simulation is the outdoor surface temperature.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/QSAjpdZCfl30aLf4LSebA*UNbopx44QZnQTyiEO-H0AwSDgs*-b7d5NRJz5YR-WqzZMUv69L7L3HzoZ9sJMOdcWI3MpSppM*/FastOutdoorClimateMap.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/QSAjpdZCfl30aLf4LSebA*UNbopx44QZnQTyiEO-H0AwSDgs*-b7d5NRJz5YR-WqzZMUv69L7L3HzoZ9sJMOdcWI3MpSppM*/FastOutdoorClimateMap.JPG)\n\nThe image above and the file attached show you that you can really boil it down to just this one output that you need from the E+ simulation for your case. \u00a0You can even connect up a panel with only that output to the **Run Simulation** component to get a much faster import of data from the CSV.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1454937", "name": "FastOutdoorClimateMap.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 4, 2016 at 2:52pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1454673", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1454936"}
