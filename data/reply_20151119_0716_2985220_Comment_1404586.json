{"body": "\nBeautiful, thank you Vinu, Anton, Mostapha, by now I ve managed to farm my company's desktops for E+ analysis of a massive Dome shaped building with high computation time. I used Flux to communicate the directories, and to copy libraries between the different desktops inspired from [this](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profiles/blogs/acadia-2015-hackathon-sending-snippets-via-flux)\u00a0post. I had some issued since E+ wouldn't run files located in shared folder so I needed to work around that and automatically copy the result files back to the shared folders when analysis is done. (any ideas how i could skip this step?)\n\nI was also wondering if I could have LB and HB looking if the \"_defaulFolders\" already exist and if so not to create new ones as in this case I will not need to copy all the created materials from one machine to the other.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFinally Mostapha I was wondering if I could run .bat files for Daylight analysis as described\u00a0[here](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/running-honeybee-in-parallel-across-multiple-computers-in-a). I tried to run the .bat files created from the \"runDaylightAnalysis\" component but unfortunately I receive no results so far.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you again for the posts!\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "November 19, 2015 at 07:16AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1404024", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1404586"}
