{"body": "\nThank you, guys. \u00a0I learned 90% of what I know about Python from you and your code, Mostapha, so a sizable amount of the credit still goes to you.\n\n<br/>Marco, to be clear about how to factor in a COP with the Ideal Air System, you only get raw values of sensible and latent heat to be removed/added to the zone when you run an ideal air system. \u00a0This is what is coming out of the Read EP Result component. \u00a0To give yourself a rough estimate of how much\u00a0electricity\u00a0or gas that this sensible and latent heat corresponds to, you can divide these sensible/latent loads by your COP. \u00a0We could have done this automatically for you in the cooling/heating results but we felt that it was very important that users be aware that just dividing by a COP is a very rough way to estimate energy use and so you should do this with the Separate Data component and the native grasshopper Division component.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 09, 2015 at 01:00PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1221045", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1221254"}
