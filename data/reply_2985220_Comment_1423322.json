{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThis is the thesis I was referring too [http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/142386/files/EPFL_TH4587.pdf](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/142386/files/EPFL_TH4587.pdf).\u00a0 I haven't gone through the whole thing to make sure but from what I see it provides a pretty good literature review and compilation of behavioral modelling for important user actions on different building components like windows, doors, thermal parameters, etc. He also goes through a lot of different mathematical frameworks one can use to model these.\n\n\n\nI'll try and extract useful information out of this and other papers and perhaps make my own review of sorts and share it with everyone here. See where that takes us.\n\n\n\nI did find another interesting thing looking around, researchers from UPENN were combining ABM methodology and EnergyPlus. They used the MLE+ framework ([http://mlab.seas.upenn.edu/mlep/](http://mlab.seas.upenn.edu/mlep/)) to connect matlab and E+ and allow the actions of the agent in their example to interact with the E+ simulation at each timestep. Is something like that available today in GH or LB/HB? Sounds like an interesting platform, allowing for these connections to E+ but man don't let me go into Matlab :(\n\n(link of the paper [http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2013/p_2464.pdf](http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2013/p_2464.pdf))\n\nKind regards,<br/>Theodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "December 17, 2015 at 8:11pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1422670", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1423322"}
