{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nThank you for your thoughts.\u00a0 I should also mention the alternatives that I am considering:\n\n\n\n1) The component can sense whether the windSpeed data is aligned with the _dryBulbTemperature and _prevailTemperature and, if so, I just output 1 branch of data using the wind speed at each hour.\u00a0 It sounds like you would advocate for this and, as I am thinking about it more, this makes sense to me too.\n\n2) Instead of outputting 2 polygons, I could just output 1 that represents the mean wind speed for the whole year.\u00a0 I am not sure if this is better.\n\n3) Instead of outputting 2 comfort polygons for the min and max windSpeed, I could run some statistical analysis on the data and output two polygons for 1 upper and lower standard deviation.\u00a0 This might be more representative of the range over the year but, again, I am not sure.\n\n\n\nAny thoughts on this or suggestion of other options is much appreciated.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 23, 2016 at 09:15AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490718", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490772"}
