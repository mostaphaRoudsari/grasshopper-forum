{"body": "\nMostapha, hello again. To follow up with this (didn't want to bug you yesterday, busy;)\n\n\n\nI've played around but haven't gotten it working yet. In the image attached, for instance, I plugged in a number to the srf index, and ran through all possible indexes for the surfaces with windows (0-5, and then 6 for good measure) without triggering any action.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt seems like, like you said, it would be straightforward--I might be running into a bug?\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/RVyZE3N-GnY5zeXLAL*xIiHxGfXQaFD-SsqU-Rg6wAVquXMM8DhqWIZBqkTDQa4NNOvpln-cfwHeCojTLPGiRHb5SVZOWqr-/Clipboard02.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/RVyZE3N-GnY5zeXLAL*xIiHxGfXQaFD-SsqU-Rg6wAVquXMM8DhqWIZBqkTDQa4NNOvpln-cfwHeCojTLPGiRHb5SVZOWqr-/Clipboard02.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, this is the script that's up in hydra - I renamed (\"Armature...\" and re-tagged it (spawning what looks like new scripts on the front page, even though they're copies...I'll enter a feature request to delete old scripts we don't want to share anymore;)\n\n\n\nThanks and all the best in in PA\n\nNick.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Novelli", "created_at": "September 28, 2015 at 3:04pm", "created_by": "NickNovelli", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1367032", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1370217"}
