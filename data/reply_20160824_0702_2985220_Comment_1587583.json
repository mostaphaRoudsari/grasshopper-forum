{"body": "\nHi Theodoros and thank you for the example.\n\nI've found a problem when changing the wind direction. I corrected this in the attached (the rotation of the vector wasn't right).\n\nAlso i have a question on this. In the HumanUI window it says that the wind direction go: 0 North, 90 East, 180 south, 270 West. If this is right the example should be fixed too in order to give the right data. Right now giving 0 means that the wind is blowing from the south.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1587585", "name": "160818_ButterflyHumanUI_OutdoorCFD_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 24, 2016 at 07:02AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1583936", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1587583"}
