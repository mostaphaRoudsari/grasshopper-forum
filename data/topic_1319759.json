{"body": "\nHi all!\n\nI wonder if there's any possibility in getting hourly radiation results from a daylight simulation with cumulative sky (W-output).\n\nThe only possibility, for now, is to step by step anaylizing 8760 hours/year and combining the results then. But there's no need to explain the effort.\n\nHow can I get out hourly data from this simulation result?\n\n\n\nThank you very much in advance,\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1319758", "name": "GETTING HOURLY RADIATION DATA OF EACH LEVEL.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "July 3, 2015 at 5:48am", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "topic": "LOOKUP DAYLIGHT FOLDER - GETTING HOURLY RADIATION FILES", "id": "topic_1319759"}
