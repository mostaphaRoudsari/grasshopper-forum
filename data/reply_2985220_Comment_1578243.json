{"body": "\nHi Djordje,\n\nThanks.\n\nAfter your previous response i get a bit confused regarding the \"correct\" size of the mask in relation to the model geometry.\n\nNow i want to think out loud and tell me if i'm right or wrong:\n\nRunning the terrainMask without context gives you the mask with the original sunPath scale.\n\nThis mask is calculated up to about 100km from the location.\n\nThere is no need to scale anymore the mask? But here, is one doubt. Say i have a large model or a small one. For the fomer i want the mask to be beyond the limits of the model, so i'll scale it down ...? This won't affect the solar/radiation calculations results (or the other way around: scale up.\n\nThis is the kind of example/situation i want to be clear. I suppose and assume other will alsodo.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 7, 2016 at 10:35pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578119", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578243"}
