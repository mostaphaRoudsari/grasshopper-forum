{"body": "\nMichael,\n\nSorry for the late response. \u00a0Your interpretation of what is going on is correct. \u00a0You are having trouble running the MATLAB compiler on your system but the generation of the XML is running smoothly. \u00a0By default, Dragonfly installs the actual UWG Engine in C:\\ladybug\\UWG\\ and the MATLAB compiler installs in the\u00a0C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MATLAB\\ folder. \u00a0Can you check to be sure that this is where everything is installed on your system?\n\nCould you also confirm that your Dragonfly_Dragonfly looks like this?\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/K9K2PXYzbAvbwa0UFQ1y649GwzU8A18rG7954OWRJh8Cqbx2NfJls8KZDhztVQnrxW6Csl4zrN8zj9dTEpgG9T5KNpt04rE5/DF_DF.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/K9K2PXYzbAvbwa0UFQ1y649GwzU8A18rG7954OWRJh8Cqbx2NfJls8KZDhztVQnrxW6Csl4zrN8zj9dTEpgG9T5KNpt04rE5/DF_DF.JPG)\n\nThanks,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 7, 2017 at 1:08pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1763296", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1765607"}
