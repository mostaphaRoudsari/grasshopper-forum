{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a thermal zone with 2 windows in the same size, one on the north wall, the other on the south wall, which fit the criteria of window-based wind-driven cross ventilation as you explained.\n\n\n\nMay I ask how to use two **setEPAirFlow** components **in tandem**, as you suggested, to specify the **_windowAngle2North**?\n\n\n\nI noticed that in your natural ventilation demo file on Hydra, there are three thermal zones, two of them have windows facing opposite directions. However, only one zero value is assigned to the _**windowAngle2North** input node on the **setEPAirFlow** components for the **2) Custom Chimney Object** workflow.\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "September 20, 2016 at 4:08am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1601452", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1602636"}
