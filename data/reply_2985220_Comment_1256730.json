{"body": "\nThank you both very much for your answers!\n\nI updated honeybee to the last version and the issue with the EP construction is solved :)\n\nAs for the adaptive comfort, I solved with the simulationOutputs_, as you saw in the file; unfortunately, I cannot use the ladybug component, as I am currently working in Italy and Germany.\n\nI also thank you very much for the new ground temperature component, it does exactly what I was looking for :)\u00a0\n\n\n\nAbout the additional_Strings component, I am not sure I understand its functioning, so I will try to explain how I think it should work.\n\n1) Does it overwrite everything that is defined with Honeybee?\n\n2) Some of the schedules I want to add are nested inside the internal gains (for example, in People gains, I would like to add the Clothing insulation). Therefore, I should use the additional_Strings to substitute the whole internal gains component from Honeybee with the E+ object, am I right? However, as I don't want lose all the advantage of a parametric software like grasshopper and the optimization of Galapagos, I would like to define all my schedules with the csv schedule component of honeybee and call them afterwards with the additional_Strings as external files.... this way everything should work, right?\n\nNext week I will give it a try and let you know if it worked.\n\n\n\nthank you again\n\nLetizia\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Letizia Martinelli", "created_at": "April 5, 2015 at 2:28am", "created_by": "LetiziaMartinelli", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256246", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256730"}
