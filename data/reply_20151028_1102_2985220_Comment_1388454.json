{"body": "\nHello all!<br/><br/>I am having the same issue of the component reporting \"Can't find the results for the study\" even though the .ill files are actually appearing in the working directory. After digging quite deep into why this is happening, I have found out that the Honeybee function\u00a0isTheStudyOver fails to report that the study is actually still running, meaning, that it returns \"yes, it's over\" even though all the cmd windows are still open. And that happens because the proc.stdout simply does not contain any records.<br/><br/>An interesting point is that the same GH file runs fine on all computers in our studio except the one which has Windows 10 installed. Other than that I cannot find any differences between the different computers and why it would not run on one of them.<br/><br/>Does anybody know if win10 is actually the problem here or if I am missing some other reason for this problem?<br/><br/>Thank you!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rusne Sileryte", "created_at": "October 28, 2015 at 11:02AM", "created_by": "RusneSileryte", "parent_id": "topic_1203169", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1388454"}
