{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\n\n\nGlad that you're excited. \u00a0All of your old GH files will still work as they originally did. \u00a0The only issue is that, if you want to edit these old files using the new LB+HB components, the old version is not compatible with the new components and you will get a warning from any of the new components that you are not using the latest version if you drop it onto the canvas of an older GH definition.\n\n\n\nIf you have a GH definition that you must update so that you can edit it, the safest way to do this is to go through component-by-component in your definition and replace the old Ladybug + Honeybee components with new ones in your LB+HB tabs. \u00a0This is what I would recommend for the majority of the Ladybug community and in cases where you want to be sure that everything works correctly in your new GH file.\n\n\n\nOf course, I know that this process above is tedious and, if you are willing to risk not having a perfect file in order to maximize your speed, I will mention that there is a way of trying to update your old GH definitions using the Ladybug_Update Ladybug component. \u00a0The \"updateThisFile\" input can search through your GH definition and try to replace the code in all LB+HB components with new code. \u00a0HOWEVER, this does not always work - particularly in the cases where a new component does not have the same inputs and outputs as its older version. \u00a0Such components with different inputs/outputs have to be updated manually as stated above after the initial run of the Update Ladybug component. Also, this process with the\u00a0Update Ladybug component\u00a0technically syncs the components in your GH definition to what is on our github, which is not as stable as the version that we release here so be wary of bugs in files updated this way.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 15, 2014 at 01:50PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1131492", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1132047"}
