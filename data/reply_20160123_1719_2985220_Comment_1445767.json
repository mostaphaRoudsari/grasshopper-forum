{"body": "\nHi Grasshope\n\n\n\nI have done two type of analysis about your results and I think that it's right.<br/>At 1:00 , there is no sun, the air temperature and relative humidity are more high than 14:00, while the wind speed is low. So it's more probable to have situations of discomfort with this assumptions.<br/>In fact, the high wind can decrease the sensation of discomfort during the summer as well as low levels of humidity.<br/>Besides this check one can see where there are shaded zones. So, it's possible to check the results using \"comfort in shade\" method.<br/>**1 AGO 14:00**\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zRe4LlmRG6amACzxPG3YI1TA*NqoiPH7FLzeImjqnrIo1m*8OvZc3-bKYQ8PRL8S0DRhfkT6NfDwLE4ALRSvOrTApJtJ5Ww8/Canvasat003351.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zRe4LlmRG6amACzxPG3YI1TA*NqoiPH7FLzeImjqnrIo1m*8OvZc3-bKYQ8PRL8S0DRhfkT6NfDwLE4ALRSvOrTApJtJ5Ww8/Canvasat003351.png)\n\nIf you compare the image above with yours , you'll see that the yellow areas overlap the shaded zones.\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/zRe4LlmRG6YJSBNW4SkrmpM*kb9rvZlJrptcyL4-1MbKqn-FhaPGuY-qtOiUCdXGwNNK1E5FMrc-dgEzIK56yQoIU4lTI8Lz/Demostration_01.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/zRe4LlmRG6YJSBNW4SkrmpM*kb9rvZlJrptcyL4-1MbKqn-FhaPGuY-qtOiUCdXGwNNK1E5FMrc-dgEzIK56yQoIU4lTI8Lz/Demostration_01.png)\n\n\n\nBests\n\nAntonello\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "January 23, 2016 at 05:19PM", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "topic_1445825", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1445767"}
