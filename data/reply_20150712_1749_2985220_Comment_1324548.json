{"body": "\nHi Yao,\n\nI'm sorry that nobody get back to you on this sooner. What you really need is the output of the energy simulation and not the comfort tool.\n\nBack to your file for an energy simulation you need to create a zone which is a closed Brep. You also need to make sure that you set is conditioned to False if you want the space not to be ventilated.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/JHmXNI-tCTp9m4Tuo4yQwadQPEjh7gTh6Rjj8OSsUgVmBeAECyxbTVCfa2HOK5pES1iA08TQ*AkZzQXaKHnflCfo2wYulQNy/indoorvsoutdoorTemp.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/JHmXNI-tCTp9m4Tuo4yQwadQPEjh7gTh6Rjj8OSsUgVmBeAECyxbTVCfa2HOK5pES1iA08TQ*AkZzQXaKHnflCfo2wYulQNy/indoorvsoutdoorTemp.png)\n\nCheck the attached file for a working example for box room. I used Mass2Zones component to create the zone but you can also create it surface by surface if you want.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1324550", "name": "HBinvsout_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 12, 2015 at 05:49PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1284915", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1324548"}
