{"body": "\nGrasshope,\n\nThanks for the detailed explanation. \u00a0At the least, I can put in an extra check in the Run Simulation component to see if the ddy file is incomplete and, if so, we just size the system using the extreme periods in the weather file like we did before I made the change. \u00a0I should also say that there is a check for this right now but it doesn't catch your case. \u00a0If you remove the ddy file from the epw folder, you should see that the Run Simulation component works fine.\n\n\n\nTo add the extra check in the Run Simulation component and to make sure that I catch your case correctly, I am going to need the ddy file that is next to the epw file on your system. \u00a0If possible, it would also be great to have the epw you are using.\n\n\n\nRight now, your GH file works for me because I am running it with one of the EPW files from the DOE website. \u00a0Once I get the ddy file, I can make sure that it is fixed.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "July 23, 2016 at 5:13am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570205", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570518"}
