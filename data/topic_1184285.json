{"body": "\n\n\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI'm running an annual daylight simulation with honeybee using multiple cores creating multiple results files. When trying to analyse the results files using \"Honeybee read all the hourly results from Annual Daylight Study\" I've found it only reads half of them.\n\n\n\nIn the below picture I've created a test surface with 8 points but only 4 points are read.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas please let me know\n\nThanks\n\nJames\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3WL4yNYnOoZtU66p93WVwx6qpwHwF-yvuM-tZfTuTJUVNM5CFcNHzVLAyJM4npGx7EUMIuNwjdImT4kXD9Up-ER0Iia1KdcS/AnnualSimulation.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3WL4yNYnOoZtU66p93WVwx6qpwHwF-yvuM-tZfTuTJUVNM5CFcNHzVLAyJM4npGx7EUMIuNwjdImT4kXD9Up-ER0Iia1KdcS/AnnualSimulation.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James Lacy-Smith", "created_at": "December 9, 2014 at 7:47am", "created_by": "JamesLacySmith", "topic": "Honeybee annual simulation problem", "id": "topic_1184285"}
