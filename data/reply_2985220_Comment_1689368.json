{"body": "\nHi Elzine,\n\n\n\nThank you for sharing this with us. Enjoyed reading the paper. It very well echoes the current sentiment in the industry. The paper made me recollect something a professor once shared. He said, \"If you're an architect and you think you need a Sustainable design consultant then there's something wrong.\" I believe in what he said. It is an architect's responsibility.\n\n\n\nI like the way engineers work. They always back their designs with analysis &amp; calculations. I often think architects could do the same with right education. When I discuss this with other architects, the common response is, \"But it may hinder the creative design process.\" However, I am not in agreement with that.\n\n\n\nA great read indeed. Thanks a lot!\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "February 11, 2017 at 4:59am", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "topic_1688501", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1689368"}
