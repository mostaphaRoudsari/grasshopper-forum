{"body": "\nThanks Mustapha for the quick reply.\n\n\n\nI have checked both this example you gave here, and also the workshop in youtube to make sure, a part of searching here in the posts, but I am still not able to visualize the annual radiation values for the surface I want to calculate.\n\nThe Output I can have with the \"readAnnualResultsI\" component allows me to have the DA, UDI, etc.. that depends on occupancy, illuminance levels, etc...\n\nI have tried with other component but without any luck.\n\nSo I am stuck where I was before.\n\nI enclose part of the file I am working on.\n\nAs you can see what I can visualize are DLA, UDLI, CDA and sDA only, I cannot find the option to see the annual radiation.\n\nIf you can have a look it would be very helpful!\n\nThanks again for the support,\n\n\n\nFederico\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1765857", "name": "Example_Radiation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Federico", "created_at": "June 07, 2017 at 08:24PM", "created_by": "Federico587", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1765396", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1765855"}
