{"body": "\nHi Sarith,\n\nThe result will be very similar. I use Popen in cases that the analysis doesn't take long time (e.g. evalglare), or I don't want command editor to pop-up during the analysis. Also I had a better experience with Popen for permission issues. That's why I use it for FalseColor.exe for instance.\n\nExcited to see the results of your research. Are you going to present it at Radiance's workshop this year?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 24, 2015 at 10:51PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1331617", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1331880"}
