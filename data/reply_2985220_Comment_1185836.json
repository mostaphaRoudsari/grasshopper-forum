{"body": "\nhi Mostapha and Chris, I just had to jump into this conversation about natural ventilation. I have been trying to look into different ways to model heat transfer - like Cfdesign that went through acquisition into autodesk simulation package and some catia plugins that I cant afford. and what you two talk about sounds like music to my ears. The closest thing I know is [ambiens by Tas suite](http://lmnts.lmnarchitects.com/featured/tas-ambiens/), which got covered by Lmnts. below you see an image of my design it is based off your work - ladybug radiation analysis. right now its more ore less an artistic illustration, esp the wind part shown as arrows. I am designing an advanced facade system that integrate louvers, solar chimneys and natural ventilation. identifying development application is one thing but withouth enough climate data sets that might also be an animatable parameter using native grasshopper components.[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/YRV3Lv4YkEJm3H4tuuFuKCVTs5KDaOhilFCXP0HR6OtrxT8iZuT4mv4xGWb4iPGde9nHuPLUynnkCXHE-iKfQ7bOUYe938yN/tttfacadetest32_rendercollagewitharrows.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/YRV3Lv4YkEJm3H4tuuFuKCVTs5KDaOhilFCXP0HR6OtrxT8iZuT4mv4xGWb4iPGde9nHuPLUynnkCXHE-iKfQ7bOUYe938yN/tttfacadetest32_rendercollagewitharrows.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Youngjae chung", "created_at": "December 10, 2014 at 11:28pm", "created_by": "YOUNGJAECHUNG", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1185833", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1185836"}
