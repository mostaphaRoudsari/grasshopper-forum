{"body": "\nDear Chris and Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThe IDF file is generated from a workflow similar to Chris' outdoor microclimate map demo file on Hydra. So, only the output variables relevant to microclimate map analysis and total thermal energy are specified.\n\n\n\nThe huge size of the IDF file might be attributed to the total number of zones (77) and the hourly time step for simulation.\n\n\n\nWhy I need annual hourly results is because I want to calculate the percentage of outdoor spaces with an annual average UTCI temperature within the comfortable range of 9-26 degrees.\n\n\n\nUnless I'm only interested in the UTCI of a particular hour, I'm not sure how I can simplify the workflow to reduce the size of the csv file and consequently, reducing the time to read the csv file...\n\n\n\nAppreciate your advice!\n\nTHanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "February 4, 2016 at 9:32am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1454219", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1454560"}
