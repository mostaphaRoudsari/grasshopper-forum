{"body": "\nHello!\n\nI have a quick question concerning the view analysis component.\n\nWhen I input a list of BREPS in the _geometry plug, are they also taken into account as obstacles to the view? or should I add them to the context_ plug?\n\nIn practice: if I input some building fa\u00e7ades in _geometry, _viewpoints can see through fa\u00e7ades as if they were transparent when the same fa\u00e7ades are not in the context_ plug?\n\n\n\nIn other words: _geometry can block view rays to other sensors on the same _geometry?\n\n\n\nThank you for your answer. Hope it was clear enough\n\nPietro\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pietro Florio", "created_at": "January 21, 2016 at 9:00am", "created_by": "PietroFlorio", "topic": "view analysis component on Ladybug", "id": "topic_1444172"}
