{"body": "\nHi Atika and Mostapha,\n\nI have the same problem before, after I read about your suggestion, I try to use the weather file from energy plus folder and It worked. But when compare my weather file with the weather file from energy plus, both of them were identical, so the problem wasn't about the weather file. And when I move the weather file to another folder, It failed again.\n\nSo the problem is about the name of the folder, if we put our weather file inside folder c:\\New Folder (for example), our simulation will failed, but if we put our weather file in c:\\New_Folder or c:\\newFolder or something else without spacing, It will worked.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Agus Hariyadi", "created_at": "June 18, 2014 at 8:37am", "created_by": "kirpytus", "parent_id": "topic_1089161", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1089808"}
