{"body": "\nHello everybody,\u00a0\n\nI am running lately some studies about external glare/veiling Glare.\n\nI found really difficult to play with Radiance glass material because cannot input a \u00a0selectivity to it. how can I sort out this problem?\n\nI used 2 different glass transmittance and i get higher luminance value on the external facade for the glass with higher transmittance, which does not make much sense to me.\n\nAny hint on that?\n\nI added a picture as well to show which is the effect that i am looking to replicate.\n\nThanks!\n\nAmedeo\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1254317", "name": "photo.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1254318", "name": "GlassTramittance0.8.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1254319", "name": "Glasstrasmittance0.6.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "amedeo scofone", "created_at": "April 01, 2015 at 05:26AM", "created_by": "amedeoscofone", "topic": "Reflective Glass in Radiance", "id": "topic_1254320"}
