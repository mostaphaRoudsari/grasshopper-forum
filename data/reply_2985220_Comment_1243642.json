{"body": "\nSorry for that.\n\nI'm using Dimitrius file as a basis for the example.\n\nWhen i connect the output of the EPWindowShades to the LB_ComfortShadeBenefit inputs i'm getting the error i mentioned (See 1 in file). When i exploded the trees for both shades and windows and connect just one branch of each it works (see 2). You can see that both trees corresponds well.\n\nHope it is clear now.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1243643", "name": "Shade_Benefit_Evaluation_01_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 16, 2015 at 3:05pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1243428", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1243642"}
