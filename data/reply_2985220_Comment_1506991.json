{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha\n\n\n\nLooking back, my question wasn't very well phrased. I currently have a facade where each panel's normal is perpendicular to the sun angle. The goal is to instead use radiation values as a parameter and have the facades angle to optimize interior radiation values. I used your test file and replaced all sunlight hour analysis with solar radiation and it still won't work. I get a non-sequence stackvalue error and occasionally, an error at the genskymatrix node. Any ideas?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bomin Kim", "created_at": "April 12, 2016 at 11:59am", "created_by": "BominKim", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1481691", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1506991"}
