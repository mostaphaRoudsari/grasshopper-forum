{"body": "\nHi Taso,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if you had any success with linking BSDF materials to EnergyPlus. I would love to be able to use the vast database and ease of Window 7.3 in my simulations.\n\n\n\nAs for the non BSDF idf files that window can create, is there an easier way of importing them in HB than simply copying all the values manually to a new material construction?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1430662", "name": "GlzSys_LowE_Avg.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1430663", "name": "GlzSys_LowE_Bsdf.idf"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1430664", "name": "GlzSys_LowE_Spec.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 04, 2016 at 08:27PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416180", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1430661"}
