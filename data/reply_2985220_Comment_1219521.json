{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for posting the components, I am playing around with them now.\n\n\n\nI have sucessfully run a simulation with large areas of my building solely mechanically ventilated.\n\n\n\nI am trying to run the adaptive comfort models but my computer freezes every time I try to create the mesh. Now, I understand it is my model, it is quite a large building. Is there an option I can choose to make it run faster? I suppose a larger grid size would help. The problem is that computer starts freezing even when I bring the mesh view factor component on the canvas (with nothing selected).\n\n\n\nI'll keep you posted when I actually manage to run the comfort tools. Thanks!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 5, 2015 at 11:57pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1218985", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1219521"}
