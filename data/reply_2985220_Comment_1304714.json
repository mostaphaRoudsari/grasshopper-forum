{"body": "\nHi Daniel,\n\n1. See\u00a0[this discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/unable-to-set-the-floor-constructions?xg_source=activity) for the ground floor question.\n\n2. Use the HB_addToEPLibrary to add the materials\\constructions for your active project. In your file you didn't connect anything to the component. If you want those to be permanent you need to manually add them to the userCustomEPLibrary.idf file, usually located at c:\\ladybug, but can be at another location in your case.\n\n3. You need to set the isConditioned input to True in the HB_createHBZones.\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "June 6, 2015 at 1:56pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1303921", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1304714"}
