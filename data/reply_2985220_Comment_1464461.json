{"body": "\nHi Ejnar,\n\nCheck the attached file. Parallel views are tricky but fortunately Rhino provides the info that we need to re-create the view in Radiance. I thought I [have already fixed this two years ago](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/6)\u00a0but seems that was not the case.
