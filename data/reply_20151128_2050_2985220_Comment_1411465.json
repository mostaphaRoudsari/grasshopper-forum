{"body": "\nDear Mostapha, thank you for your reply!\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if I explained my point clearly. So, let's use the following example of a building surface with two patches after subdivision for simulation, each having a test point at its centroid with an irradiance reading.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/FAP00mbKuci5gQ5iQ4kx9Xu-V2ixYZKpLdHa7XVBkmHlD9y0ARde*8dqiD9J-aQpT2EThj4r0VogsVqfq5q0HGO4WR4PPADX/Picture1.png\" width=\"451\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/FAP00mbKuci5gQ5iQ4kx9Xu-V2ixYZKpLdHa7XVBkmHlD9y0ARde*8dqiD9J-aQpT2EThj4r0VogsVqfq5q0HGO4WR4PPADX/Picture1.png)\n\nSo, shoudn't the total radiation energy for this surface be calculated as the sum of the radiation energy for patch A (3*2=6kwh) and that for patch B (5*1=5kwh) which is 11kwh?\n\n\n\nThe result for the current summation method used in Ladybug is (3+5)*(2*1)=24kWh.\n\n\n\nAs far as I understand, irradiance is an \"intensity\" variable, so, we need to multiply it by area to get the value of the absolute amount of radiation energy for a surface.\n\n\n\nPlease kindly comment.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "November 28, 2015 at 08:50PM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1411460", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1411465"}
