{"body": "\nHi everyone.\n\nI was wondering whether it would be possible to calculate only one output of a component in Ladybug.\n\nI would like to optimize the orientation of a panel with Galapagos, where the:\n\n- Genome = Panel Orientation\u00a0\n\n- Fitness = ACenergyPerYear\n\nThis is running very slowly and I was thus wondering if all the other outputs of the Photovoltaics Surface could be disabled to make it run faster. Any other suggestions are welcome as well.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0N6V1bax3FM0aY6-6QskfFb7If*QNgXvfD4wZkzUExMhNjyTfNG30XZXT6hAna1k4ETeP3KPZV4nmBOOpBmVixtudKMpkDRC/Capture14.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0N6V1bax3FM0aY6-6QskfFb7If*QNgXvfD4wZkzUExMhNjyTfNG30XZXT6hAna1k4ETeP3KPZV4nmBOOpBmVixtudKMpkDRC/Capture14.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erik Pelicaen", "created_at": "July 08, 2016 at 04:38AM", "created_by": "ErikPelicaen", "topic": "Ladybug Simplify Component Calculation", "id": "topic_1561998"}
