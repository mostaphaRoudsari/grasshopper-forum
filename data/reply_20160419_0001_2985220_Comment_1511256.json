{"body": "\nHi Sarith, yes that's the one.\n\n\n\nI know it's available, and I might go ahead and play around with it this week. Was just wondering if it is compatible with the whole LB/HB project (by compatible I meant easily transferred). I know the amount of work that is going on atm behind the scenes though so this isn't really a (high priority) request.
