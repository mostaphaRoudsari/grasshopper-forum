{"body": "\nHi Jose,\n\nWelcome to the camp! ;)\n\nLocked version and unlocked version are the same code. It's a Windows 8 \u00a0permission\u00a0issue. Can you try to sign in as Administrator and let me know if that solves the problem?\n\nAnother option is to change the working directory to a folder that you have the full permissions.\n\nI'm running Ladybug on Windows 8 on my laptop with no problem. It's going to be a\u00a0common\u00a0problem thoughand I should probably find a way to run the batch files in \"Elevated Mode\" or re-write GenCumulativeSky in Python so Ladybug doesn't have to run it as a batch file. I added this as an [issue](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/32).\n\nThank you for reporting and let me know if any of my suggestions solves the problem.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 02, 2013 at 01:30PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_843075", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_843091"}
