{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI think there should be an option to include sun vectors up to and including the end of the period as this is required when doing say solar access analysis.\n\n\n\nI've just been tripped up by this when creating a Solar Fan for a solar access exclusion zone to a public space between 11am-4pm. An initial pass using only hourly intervals effectively only calculated a solar envelope for 11am-3pm as the last vector (4pm) was not included!\n\n\n\nIt did not seem right to me the i realised the last vector was missing, so i increased the intervals to 12 (i.e 5min intervals) which then means the last vector is 3:55pm.\n\n\n\nIdeally the sun vectors produced from a sunpath would include the last period, and components would include or exclude this depending on their purpose (e.g Solar Fan would include, Shading would exclude but perhaps with an option to include, etc). But this would mess up existing definitions so understand it might not be the way to go\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Owen Sharp", "created_at": "July 13, 2016 at 07:23PM", "created_by": "OwenSharp411", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1206756", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1565307"}
