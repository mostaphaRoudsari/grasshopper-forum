{"body": "\nHoneybee and Ladybug work great when using relatively simple geometry, either generated in Rhino or Grasshopper. However, sometimes I receive a more complex file for analysis, and when I try to use that geometry for analysis, Honeybee becomes extraordinarily slow.\n\n\n\nIt seems like writing a RAD file takes many many minutes for a Rhino file of ~20mb, which for DIVA is a walk in the park - a few seconds and it's done.\n\n\n\nI want to move most of my workflow from DIVA-based to Honeybee-based but this is quite a big obstacle.\n\nI have managed to run an analysis in DIVA and then connect the results to Honeybee's analysis files for better analysis, but it would be great to have one simple workflow.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reinier Zeldenrust", "created_at": "August 29, 2014 at 4:33am", "created_by": "ReinierZeldenrust", "topic": "Handling complex geometry in Honeybee vs DIVA", "id": "topic_1123312"}
