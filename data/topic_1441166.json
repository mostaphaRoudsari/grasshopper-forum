{"body": "\nHi All!\n\n\n\nI'm testing out the use of the Thermal Autonomy component, however the prerequisite Microclimate Map Analysis component is not giving out any data.\n\nI've gone over my component inputs and am confused as to where I am going wrong.\n\n\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Please note that I have changed the coding to take 8.2 instead of 8.3 as our uni computers only have 8.2 for the moment\n\n\n\nPS. excuse my file, I am also playing with the parametric iterations for running several simulations at once.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fjCJhks0XLueaItAZXPvOwswzT2PCjoPf01uutf*cDbvbfjzgDPegJpzpU6jVblzvFmkhkoH8-C*9bpAmb8seYxauXEWDATp/AdaptiveComfortIssue.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fjCJhks0XLueaItAZXPvOwswzT2PCjoPf01uutf*cDbvbfjzgDPegJpzpU6jVblzvFmkhkoH8-C*9bpAmb8seYxauXEWDATp/AdaptiveComfortIssue.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1441164", "name": "Workflow_V1.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1441165", "name": "userCustomEPLibrary.idf"}], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "January 18, 2016 at 3:10pm", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "topic": "Error: Microclimate Map Analysis Component not producing data", "id": "topic_1441166"}
