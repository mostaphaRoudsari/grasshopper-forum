{"body": "\nRoudsari,Ok, so the results of BF can be assumed (or proved?) to be the very same as those from OpenFOAM?\n\nYes I know about that comparison. Zarisu is a good friend of mine actually, so I've been on the sideline on that comparison. But my interest is within the thermal investigations in big indoor spaces/semi-outdoor spaces as I am studying temperature distributions in atria. So it was regarding those kind of comparisons.\n\n\n\nI sure hope I have time within my project to test out BF and hopefully compare to Ansys. I'd btw be using the k-w SST solver in Ansys. Which solvers are available in BF for indoor studies?\n\n\n\n- Lasse\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lasse Hamborg", "created_at": "November 30, 2016 at 05:12AM", "created_by": "LasseHamborg", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1648351", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1648873"}
