{"body": "\nHi Tim and Abraham,\n\nTim, Github is free unless you want to have private repository. You can just select the free plan. Example files on Hydra are usually synced with the version on Food4Rhino (which is the stable release) and not the github (which is the production version). Orientation analysis issue looks like a bug. The reason it hasn't been fixed is that I want to re-write the component for sunlight-hours analysis. The current version is such a mess.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 8:29pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1411085", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1412677"}
