{"body": "\nDear Ladybugers and Honeybeeers,\n\n\u00a0\n\nI would like to use this medium to spread the word about a paper that might provide guidance and support in the implementation and use of complex frameworks using LBHB.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe paper depicts a framework for optimizing passive performance by exploring elements such as geometry, building orientation, fenestration configurations, and shading devices in response to particular program requirements, site-specific constraints, and climate conditions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nASHRAE 90.1 was used as compliant reference model for four different climate zones, incorporating real sites and urban overshadowing conditions. The results showed improvements within a range of 4% to 17% in Energy Use Intensity reduction, while improving daylighting within a range of 27% to 65%, depending on the location and climate.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOverall, the framework provide guidance to make more informed decisions in early-stages of design, where as many know, the impacts can be the greatest.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf interested, please visit one of the following links:\n\n[Elsevier Publication.
