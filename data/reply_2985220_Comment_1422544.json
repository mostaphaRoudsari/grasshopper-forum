{"body": "\nWhat is the outdoor temperature during the peak cooling condition?\n\n\n\nIf it is lower than the internal zone temperature, then the zone is shedding heat to the outdoors. In this case, lower wall thermal conductivity leads to lower peak cooling load.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Octagon26", "created_at": "December 16, 2015 at 10:43am", "created_by": "Octagon26", "parent_id": "topic_1422475", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1422544"}
