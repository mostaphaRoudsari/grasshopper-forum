{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to test a bunch of different geometry options (different window to wall ratios, etc) in Honeybee and E+ for daylight factor, energy performance, etcetera.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHowever when I want to input a list of options - say 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 WWR - See attachment - for the South Facade I only get one result, as the glazingCreator component only creates one surface, and the runDaylightAnalysis component combines all the inputs into one geometry for testing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThere a few ways around it:\n\n\n\nBut they all don't exactly do what I want and can be quite a bit of hassle. Is there an easier way to do it?\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1116146", "name": "Screenshot_WWR_options.png"}], "created_by_name": "Reinier Zeldenrust", "created_at": "August 13, 2014 at 03:20AM", "created_by": "ReinierZeldenrust", "topic": "Testing a list of options using Honeybee / E+", "id": "topic_1116147"}
