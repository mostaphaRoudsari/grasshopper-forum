{"body": "\nChris,\n\nYes, even with no stored/internalized geometry and data the problem persists. I'm 100% sure that the component was able to run in an earlier gh definition (see pic) but only with grids with dimensions different than 1m precisely (or larger?...i don't remember). I will try to run the same definition in another machine if possible tonight.\n\n\n\nAbraham,\n\nYou can subdivide any honeybee surface into smaller ones and then join them into a zone, like Chris' hydra examples with EP ground zones. Since conditions inside the superzone are stable, assuming an ideal HVAC system and schedules, each subdivided patch of zone surfaces will yield a different Tsurf result based on the external heat balance and internal temps. Theoretically this freedom to describe surface patches in more detail can speed up calculations and provide better results.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1748905", "name": "Frame_00012.png"}], "created_by_name": "Aris V", "created_at": "May 10, 2017 at 7:25am", "created_by": "ArisVartholomaios", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1749125", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1748904"}
