{"body": "\nHi Antonello,<br/><br/>My apology for taking me too long to reply.<br/>I couldn't test your component on my PC due to it not supporting the System.Net.WebClient class.<br/>I tested your component on my friend's PC tonight, and it worked great!<br/>I can already see some of the nice benefits of its usage. With the Google Earth component, you made a quite a remarkable addition to the Ladybug set of components! Keep up this great work!\n\n<br/>Just as a mention: I am attaching a screenshot of two new components:<br/>The first one: \"Terrain analysis\" performs a couple of terrain analysis types, and the second one: \"Flow paths\" performing the water flow analysis.<br/>Screenshot example of both is given below:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/bcOWtfWqONb90N2hGhF0gw*UMNLNW*r7AuLHoVX*tWKlqt4rhNDW4kvB5Ko0dp99LVJSmTA1HFfBi8yQz5zkp33Y33jHJJEk/hillshade_flowpaths_vesuvius2b.jpg?width=300\" width=\"300\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/bcOWtfWqONb90N2hGhF0gw*UMNLNW*r7AuLHoVX*tWKlqt4rhNDW4kvB5Ko0dp99LVJSmTA1HFfBi8yQz5zkp33Y33jHJJEk/hillshade_flowpaths_vesuvius2b.jpg)\n\nIt would be nice if your Terrain Generator component could benefit from using these two new ones.<br/>In order to do that, Terrain Generator would have to output the terrain in a form of surface as well. My modest advice would be to add the \"type_\" input, which will determine whether the \"terrain\" output is a mesh, or a surface. This will make it consistent with Terrain Generator 2 component.<br/>To create the terrain surface from a grid of points, use the\u00a0[NurbsSurface.CreateThroughPoints](http://4.rhino3d.com/5/rhinocommon/html/M_Rhino_Geometry_NurbsSurface_CreateThroughPoints.htm) method:<br/><br/>\n\nimport Rhino as rc<br/><br/>uDegree = vDegree = 3<br/>uClosed = vClosed = False<br/>terrainSurface = rc.Geometry.NurbsSurface.CreateThroughPoints(pts, numberOfPtsIn_vDirection, numberOfPtsIn_uDirection, uDegree, vDegree, uClosed, vClosed)\n\n\n\nOf course this is just a suggestion, I am not imposing anything.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1608764", "name": "terrainAnalysis_flowPaths_components_example.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "September 30, 2016 at 05:28PM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1598890", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1608763"}
