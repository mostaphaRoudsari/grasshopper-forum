{"body": "\nHi Djordje,\n\nthanks for everything,\n\nI need to draw a figure with azimuth = 180 and tilt angle between 0-90 degrees. because my project is fixed solar panel with azimuth at 180 degrees and various tilt angle between 0-90 degrees. Please see the picture below and tell me how can I separate the values for beam, diffuse, ground-reflection as well as total solar radiation for azimuth at 180 and tilt angle at 0-90 degrees.[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/gnh1ndzD4Nw*zeY-7vuMo78ocsq0*wpOxiYegSj7OnCeku-SnQfv6IsM66MllcjZXtv5R5N-zIqWi-217TGshiNxzBfwQpez/Untitled.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/gnh1ndzD4Nw*zeY-7vuMo78ocsq0*wpOxiYegSj7OnCeku-SnQfv6IsM66MllcjZXtv5R5N-zIqWi-217TGshiNxzBfwQpez/Untitled.png)\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hamid", "created_at": "July 22, 2016 at 02:03AM", "created_by": "Hamid549", "parent_id": "topic_1568511", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1569928"}
