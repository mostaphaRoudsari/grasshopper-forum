{"body": "\nHi Grassoppe,\n\n\n\nThis is a \"divide by zero\" error (see sigfpe). This happens usually due to boundary conditions or mesh quality. The GAMG solver is failing, I'm guessing that is your pressure.\n\n\n\nIf this is the same case working earlier I would guess it's a mesh error. If not, please share your folder here and I'll take a look.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "August 09, 2016 at 06:23PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1580144", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579626"}
