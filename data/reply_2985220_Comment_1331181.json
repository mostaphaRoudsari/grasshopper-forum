{"body": "\nHi Daniel,\n\nit makes sense to me what you are getting.\n\nThe result is the output f the component\u00a0shadeNetEffect. It means that it takes both the Benefit and the Harm and gives you the annual evaluation of the proposed shading element. It means that your blue areas have more benefit than harm and the red areas the opposite. The harm means that you are spoiling the space for winter time (which is different that saying \"not useful\" as you wrote or ask). Though the shade can also be useful for summer.\n\nYou can try to map just the\u00a0shadeHelpfulness/shadeHarmfulness outputs and see the \"real\" seasonal effect of the shade device. If you need an axample for that i can provide.\n\nHope it helps.\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 4:52am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1331137", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1331181"}
