{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\n\n\nI having some trouble with the create legend component. I keep getting \"to many values to unpack\". I get this error with all data I plug in to the the component. The component is up to date (version 0.59) and just to be sure I reinstalled all ladybug's user object components. Any thoughts?\n\n\n\nGr,\n\n\n\nSam\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1257242", "name": "create legend problem.png"}], "created_by_name": "Samuel de Vries", "created_at": "April 06, 2015 at 06:27AM", "created_by": "SamueldeVries", "topic": "Create legend problem", "id": "topic_1257243"}
