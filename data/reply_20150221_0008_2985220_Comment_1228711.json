{"body": "\nHi Chris and Cesar,\n\n\n\nI am not entirely sure how mean radiant temperature is calculated in EnergyPlus but I am pretty sure that to take full advantage of natural ventilation in a building, weather speed might not be the most important factor. For example, there might be a strong wind but the pressure difference in the orientations of the wind direction won't allow the space to take full use of it.\n\nIdeally you would need to run a cfd and get the numbers for such data.\n\n\n\nI wonder though, would honeybee/energyplus allow any cfd-generated schedules to actually influence the results?\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 21, 2015 at 12:08AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1229576", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228711"}
