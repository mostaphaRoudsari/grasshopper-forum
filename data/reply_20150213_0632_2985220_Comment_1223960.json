{"body": "Anastasios ,\nTo be clear about my initial suggestion, you need to create the new ground temperature object, set monthly values for ground temperature, save the new IDF, and then open it in EPLaunch and simulate it. Only then can you bring in the CSV file to GH with the read EP result component.\nRe - running the Run Energy Simulation component in GH will overwrite an IDF that you save with the IDF Editor.\n\nI should emphasize that this is only a rough approximation and it is how I would begin to assess the effect of submerging a building partially in water. It is also probably all that I would get to do within the scope of a built project unless the building was completely submerged and I knew the accuracy would affect the results a lot. If this is the case or it is for a research paper on the topic that demands a really high accuracy result and factors all of the criteria that you mention like possible solar gains through the water, you would probably have to edit the energy modeling engine since this seems to be an uncommon situation. The two types of software I know where you can edit the engine would be trynsys, as Mostapha mentioned, or you could edit the EnergyPlus source code and recompile it into your own version. Both are big feats of research that will probably take a few months so be warned. Before embarking on such a quest, definitelt post the question on the unmet hours site and check if there are not other EnergyPlus objects for modeling this.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 13, 2015 at 06:32AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223763", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223960"}
