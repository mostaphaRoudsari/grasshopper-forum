{"body": "\nHey guys,\n\n\n\nI am in trouble with the preparation of the model for the energy analysis with honeybee. To better explain the design concept i will attach a jpeg file and the .gh file. The idea behind is quite simple: i have an adiabatic room, so no sun exposure, and a surface expose on the south. This surface is discretize by nine opaque's panels, A in the jpeg file, and three glass surfaces, B.\n\n\n\nI set up the model in this way:\n\n- five adiabatic surface;\n\n- two different type of materials for glass (B) and opaque part (A) of the surface.\n\n\n\nThe problem seems \u00a0to be after the Honeybee Create Zones component. If i give the same material, glass, to hall the surfaces it works fine.\n\nI cannot identify the problem with this process. Can someone help me?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance to all of you guys!\n\nBest\n\nAngelo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1766085", "name": "Building Envelope_concept.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1766086", "name": "test room_energy analysis.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Angelo Figliola", "created_at": "June 08, 2017 at 07:42AM", "created_by": "AngeloFigliola", "topic": "TEST ROOM_ENERGY ANALYSIS SET UP", "id": "topic_1766087"}
