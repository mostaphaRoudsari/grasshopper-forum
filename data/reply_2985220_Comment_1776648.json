{"body": "\nOk, let me reply myself:\n\n\n\nThis is a workaround which might be too complicated:\n\n1. convert the zone brep into mesh\n\n2. duplicate the data for each zone based on the number of faces of the mesh of that zone\n\n3. join all mesh and flatten duplicated zone data\n\n4. use recolor mesh component to generate the colored mesh which can be baked into Rhino with the color for rendering or animation.\n\n\n\nI assume that there is more efficient way to do it ... appreciate your kind suggestion.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SAkqTdOA2dsbl6qcDKmxE1u9O65mKYyptHHsO*HfhpE8T6xDA*MVjISPZR-15GL*U9XXDj2D84DBjUaHA9mq1YFPuAuZY8gV/Image14.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/SAkqTdOA2dsbl6qcDKmxE1u9O65mKYyptHHsO*HfhpE8T6xDA*MVjISPZR-15GL*U9XXDj2D84DBjUaHA9mq1YFPuAuZY8gV/Image14.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "June 30, 2017 at 3:21am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "topic_1776396", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1776648"}
