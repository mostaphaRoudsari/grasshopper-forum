{"body": "\nVery awesome component, Djordje! \u00a0This will be useful in a lot of cases.\n\n\n\nI have one fatal error and one comment. \u00a0I am unable to run your component on my machine because of a PINVOKE error (similar to what had halted our work on OpenStudio at one point):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/XAMh5eqrnNQ*Un-IaO8MsbojgoHIGbJk1ugMI*XfQbLFR4lL03Ezat*WbWdPRmewOHkjm0PzTTeHXMeBCJeaD-*oL8uDHt8R/GDALERROR.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/XAMh5eqrnNQ*Un-IaO8MsbojgoHIGbJk1ugMI*XfQbLFR4lL03Ezat*WbWdPRmewOHkjm0PzTTeHXMeBCJeaD-*oL8uDHt8R/GDALERROR.JPG)\n\nUnfortunately, we never found to root cause of this error with OpenStudio as [this long github issue](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/214)\u00a0suggests. \u00a0The error just magically disappeared in the later OpenStudio releases. Mostapha, have you discovered anything related to this issue since the discussion?\n\n\n\nMy comment is that we really need to find some easier way to install this if we would like a large number of people to use it. \u00a0Since the whole application is only 26 MB, I would suggest having an automatic download and extraction the first time that somone runs the component. \u00a0You can sense whether the files are there the next time that the component is run. \u00a0This is similar to what is done with genDayMtx.exe:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/ladybug...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/ladybug_ladybug.py#L746-L783)\n\n... or to the epw files from the URL:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/Ladybug...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/src/Ladybug_Open%20EPW%20And%20STAT%20Weather%20Files.py#L136-L178)\n\n\n\nI also second Abraham's request for a _scale_ input on the component.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 29, 2016 at 05:39PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1557238", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1557854"}
