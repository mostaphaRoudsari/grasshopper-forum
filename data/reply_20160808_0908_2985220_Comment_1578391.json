{"body": "\nOk Djordje ... just because you asked for that ... :-)\n\nThe process of getting the mask is understood. The process of using it as a context for daylight/radiation/etc analysis is less.\n\nSo let's assume two cases for the same location:\n\n1. Small scale. Only one room, where i want to get a daylight analysis.\n\n2. Big scale. Urban area (say 10 by 10 blocks, for the sake of the discussion), where i want to perform a radiation analysis on the blocks.\n\nSo, different scales, and different tasks. The question is, what would be the flowchart to do the job taking correctly the influence of the mask for both.\n\nI believe i'm missing something from your explanation, but hopefully your answer will help not only me, but others to have a good and correct use of the component.\n\nMakes sense what i'm asking?\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 08, 2016 at 09:08AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578207", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1578391"}
