{"body": "\nHi Everyone!\n\n<br/> I\u2019m quite new to Ladybug and Honeybee so I\u2019m writing this post in order to be helped and maybe learn something more about these wonderful tools. <br/> I\u2019m doing for my master thesis in architecture some analysis about outdoor comfort, comparing simultaneously the results of PET PMV and UTCI indices. I didn\u2019t have problem to evaluate the last two ones (PMV and UTCI) but I\u2019m having some problems with the evaluation of the PET index. Apart from the fact that it takes really long to be evaluated (without considering the time that has to be spent for the MRT calculation), I don\u2019t know how I could map on a mesh the estimated values like I easily do for the PMV and UTCI indices. Attached you will find the .epw and .stat files I\u2019m using for my analysis and the .gh file I was using as try. I basically used the file about the UTCI map that Chris uploaded on Hydra, where I just added the two components I used to evaluate the PET and PMV indices. <br/> I hope I was clear enough. Probably it's just some mistake of mine and the solution is easier than I expect, but I wanted to share this problem with you all hoping you can help me.<br/> <br/> Francesco\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1521930", "name": "PMV UTCI PET.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1521931", "name": "ITA_Napoli-Capodichino.162890_IGDG.stat"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1521932", "name": "ITA_Napoli-Capodichino.162890_IGDG.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Francesco Scarpati", "created_at": "May 3, 2016 at 1:12pm", "created_by": "FrancescoScarpati", "topic": "PET evaluation problem", "id": "topic_1521933"}
