{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\n\n\nIf I remember correctly from what Christoph Reinhart told me, you can count a certain space (or point) as daylit if the Daylight Autonomy at the space (or point) is greater than 50%. \u00a0Christoph uses this to draw a line across a lot of large open rooms and divide the daylit part of the space from the not daylit part of the space. \u00a0Interestingly, he has compared this calculated line to surveys of occupants in the space who where asked to draw a line between the portion of the space that they thought was daylit and the portion that they thought was not daylit. \u00a0Ultimately, Christoph and team used this to calculate a \"Daylit Area\" of a given building, which they then used this to argue to developers and planners that floor cost pera are could be higher if a space was considered daylit.\n\n\n\nI am sorry that I cannot find the specific study for you at the moment but I remember that Christoph was working on this with my friends Tarek and Alstan. \u00a0I hope that this helps.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 23, 2014 at 11:49pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1091265", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1092766"}
