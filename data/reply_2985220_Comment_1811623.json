{"body": "\nCarmelo,\n\nThanks for reporting and thank you, Devang, for helping narrow down the probelm to the glazing. \u00a0It seems there was an old unnecessary check in the code pathway taken by curved surfaces with glazing tat was causing this to fail. \u00a0I just fixed it here:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/commit/5c936aedfb41b92...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee/commit/5c936aedfb41b92e5cbeccd9d92517cdec881e61)\n\n... and you can see that the attached version of your file works.\n\nAlso, I would still really recommend planarizing the geometry. \u00a0I know it's a little extra manual work but it will make the calculation so much faster. \u00a0This said, if you hadn't tired this method, then we never would have found the bug. \u00a0So I am glad that you tried this first.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1811625", "name": "energy_model_CGG_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "yesterday", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1811282", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1811623"}
