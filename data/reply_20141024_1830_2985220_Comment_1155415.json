{"body": "\nGlad to hear it!\n\nI think that my\u00a0gendaymtx.exe was downloaded a few months ago when I first installed Ladybug on my computer after a reinstall of windows. \u00a0You are right that the two are different sizes and the 21 KB one must be more recent.\n\nI tried using the 21 KB\u00a0gendaymtx.exe and I was able to replicate the weird radiation results. \u00a0I also noticed that the batch file runs a lot quicker with this 21 KB version, which makes me think that an error is occurring.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-a-FzCyHE-Bl0oEFN*LuSUXexbwCVc44-e5drwBYn2Uj9h92QSnW6jL2dIz5eaFzSlam5npy3l5ZtXTb*mlFu6lx9Zs3F*sA/genDayMtxError.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-a-FzCyHE-Bl0oEFN*LuSUXexbwCVc44-e5drwBYn2Uj9h92QSnW6jL2dIz5eaFzSlam5npy3l5ZtXTb*mlFu6lx9Zs3F*sA/genDayMtxError.PNG)\n\nIf I remember correctly, that link is on Mostapha's dropbox and he should be able to change it. \u00a0Mostapha, did you update the\u00a0gendaymtx.exe link in the recent past at all? \u00a0What was the reasoning behind it and would you consider putting the old one back in light of this?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 24, 2014 at 06:30PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1155183", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1155415"}
