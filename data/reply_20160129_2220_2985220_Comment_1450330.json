{"body": "\nThank you very much, Chris and Abraham, for the detailed clarification!\n\n\n\nI understand the that there are discussions among researchers about the utility of PMV model as compared to the adaptive model, especially for non air conditioned, naturally ventilated space.\n\n\n\nOur own thermal comfort survey in tropical context also indicate that:\n\n1) people felling thermally neutral (thermal sensation vote = 0) tend to be predicted as feeling slightly warm as indicated by PMV value calculated, and\n\n2) the adaptive model (ASHRAE 2013 ) seems to provide a close predication on percentage of people feeling thermally neutral than that indicated according to the PMV values calculated, comparing to the percentage based on people's actual thermal sensation vote in the context of non-AC, hybrid or naturally ventilated spaces.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, I think only through continuous empirical study can we further validate which model is more appropriate under certain climatic context.\n\n\n\nThank you, too, for revising the PMV component!\n\n\n\nCheers!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "January 29, 2016 at 10:20PM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1450418", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1450330"}
