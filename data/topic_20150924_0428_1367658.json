{"body": "\nHi\n\n\n\nI have just run a search of the code on the Python code Honeybee_Honeybee.py looking for Radiance.\n\n\n\nThere seems to be a very small number of places where the location of Radiance is hard-wired into the code. Given that NREL are releasing up-to-date versions of Radiance for Windows as they are released for Unix, and these have been placed into\u00a0C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Radiance as standard, and this is an easily locatable (via PATH settings) standard location, could this requirement to have Radiance installed in a hard-wired location be removed?\n\n\n\n\u00a0[Radiance_Paths_HoneyBee.txt](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Qvxzmt4uuyXAiNgQzDERpSo4TkY2fLxcrVf0EcrauYP6GvtDKWIqEPwTnEyvtk5H7Rqhdhj1nsXbjyWE-XpkyV9QNVN2hyBQ/Radiance_Paths_HoneyBee.txt)\u00a0\n\n\n\nM\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Michael Donn", "created_at": "September 24, 2015 at 04:28AM", "created_by": "MichaelDonn", "topic": "Radiance Paths - a solution", "id": "topic_1367658"}
