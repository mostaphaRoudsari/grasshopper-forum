{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\ni have got a question regarding the\u00a0type of surfaces\u00a0which\u00a0i think create some problem for the simulation.\n\nAs you\u00a0can see from the image below (sorry for the italian names)\u00a0there are two different types of planar surfaces:\n\n1 - the surface in which all the segments are into the geometry\n\n2 - the surface in which not all the segments are into the geometry\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/zEPY4KSmyW9gUkknRXpGHYI7HCaBx0bS54Vp*6FteuVOsWOqxSZ7qBPDU3UaRAmiHsaP3houm1ydbZDU2CVYe6xJPd-pLJ43/figureconcaveconvesse.png?width=328\" width=\"328\"/>](http://api.ning.com/files/zEPY4KSmyW9gUkknRXpGHYI7HCaBx0bS54Vp*6FteuVOsWOqxSZ7qBPDU3UaRAmiHsaP3houm1ydbZDU2CVYe6xJPd-pLJ43/figureconcaveconvesse.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis second one is the one that i think it is creating me a lot of troubles.\n\nIndeed, looking at my workflow in gh, even though i have a closed zone (from the component create HB zone) the simulation continuosly crashes with thousands of errors that i really don\u00b4t understand, like\u00a0\"surface non-planar\"\u00a0 (which is impossible because\u00a0i have checked through the label zone surfaces component and all are planar).\n\nSo my question are: am i right regarding this kind of issues due to the shape of the geometry? is it possible?\n\nIn that case, is there a way in gh/rhino to \"explode the surfaces\" to create correct shapes for the simulation?\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "July 21, 2016 at 7:01am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Wrong/correct shapes of the surfaces", "id": "topic_1569466"}
