{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Willy,\n\n\n\nThanks for your kind help! No the component gave me no errors or warnings. After running the simulation and got the ill files generated, the component shows as below:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fZ7LFFJLJtOoUmEx2frWgiQf7SaW7NHIxRJu*1kH12A3kVLPMKxSLd*3xbcUF-uicNeCe6wnFvX0k6gBA20OxPsqluyrA-kP/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fZ7LFFJLJtOoUmEx2frWgiQf7SaW7NHIxRJu*1kH12A3kVLPMKxSLd*3xbcUF-uicNeCe6wnFvX0k6gBA20OxPsqluyrA-kP/Capture.JPG)\n\nSo I have the East_Shade_0.ill,\u00a0East_Shade_state_1_0.ill, and\u00a0East_Shade_state_2_0.ill, but nothing shows up for annual analysis files or the lookupFolder_Daylighting/illFiles.\n\n\n\nAlso the shading illuminance thresholds may be odd: The assumption is the shade\u00a0could either be pulled back at the corner as a 2 meter solid surface (State 1), or cover the whole glass as a trans material (State 2). The sensor is on the floor next to the glass: when there is direct sunlight (more than 10000 lux at sensor), the curtain expands to cover the whole glass. When there is no direct sunlight on the floor sensor (less than 10000 lux at sensor), the curtain is pulled back at the corner.\n\nSo I adjusted the DSShadingState as below:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fZ7LFFJLJtNrO0RogclyeKZiLpqL*3KvnFNpsMwfpNAAOu2a49pQZJGHZtr4lRo-hSYyUMIlxijQDZnPqOaTe60J7zxW70nS/Capture.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fZ7LFFJLJtNrO0RogclyeKZiLpqL*3KvnFNpsMwfpNAAOu2a49pQZJGHZtr4lRo-hSYyUMIlxijQDZnPqOaTe60J7zxW70nS/Capture.JPG)\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if the shading control threshold won't work this way or any other tests I should run to figure out the problem. Thanks!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nXF\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "XF", "created_at": "March 16, 2017 at 10:36AM", "created_by": "XF", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1713578", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714011"}
