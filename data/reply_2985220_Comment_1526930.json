{"body": "\nHi Djordje and everyone,\n\n\n\nI am greatly enjoying these wonderful components. It is refreshing to be able to produce performance-based analyses of PV systems, as opposed to ideal analyses from programs like Tsol.\n\n\n\nI have a couple of requests or suggestions, if I may:\n\n\n\n1. The components seem to be doing a lot of heavy duty calculations, especially relating to the number of surfaces that are used (I have noticed a correlation with working time and number of input surfaces). In generally, the workflow can get quite time consuming. I was wondering then if it is possible to allow for parallel computation for these tools? Especially in the case of number of surfaces it should provide with a significant improvement (different surfaces assigned to different processors)?\n\n\n\n2. As discussed, the performance-based results according to the specific geometry of the site and building is the greatest advantage of these tools, along with them being integrated to the HB/LB and Rhino/GH community. However, for practical reasons, programs like TSol have very detailed databases for equipment characteristics. I am not entirely sure but I believe that the data for these (propriatory) databases has been extracted from open sources. I was wondering if anyone knows if this is true. If yes, is there a way we can assist in creating a database for these tools in order to quickly and easily select equipment characteristics for our PV systems?\n\n\n\nThank you for all the great work, testing, and feedback!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 9, 2016 at 10:09pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1309523", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1526930"}
