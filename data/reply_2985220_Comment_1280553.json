{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI checked your video and have a few questions.I\u00a0followed the same way of combining the objectives at the end(see image) for total radiation for cooling and heating period.The variable was the glazing percentage of an external wall of one room.\n\nI got a huge number for objectives and the simulation run almost 9 hours through the night and at the end(when I stopped it)there where no results to export.Except of the screenshots I made.I read the octopus manual and tried to understand from the forum discussions on how and what to select but still it seems to have lots of errors.\n\n\n\n- I also wanted to ask you if the generations can be repetead and visualized as in the third part of your video (\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYw7KexxThM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYw7KexxThM) ) without using matlab?only inside the gh canvas with LB HB and Octopus?\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nNita\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7PenrD0QnJMslinZ653BNsyC*AxRWYox9mAvb8mLrhmvA62z*76y2Z*cmHjE*fT5JraUPJ-M6aZmopHsdFm2fGB/objectives.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7PenrD0QnJMslinZ653BNsyC*AxRWYox9mAvb8mLrhmvA62z*76y2Z*cmHjE*fT5JraUPJ-M6aZmopHsdFm2fGB/objectives.JPG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7McCDQSLyYL3ZzvRHbkEhdli8uOath5BjD6SJfw1XleatwaPd-EksJ3V*27SHxQD44t6fFf1hhl3SlBhb6XVlD9/pareto.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/M2P*yMJoo7McCDQSLyYL3ZzvRHbkEhdli8uOath5BjD6SJfw1XleatwaPd-EksJ3V*27SHxQD44t6fFf1hhl3SlBhb6XVlD9/pareto.JPG)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1280554", "name": "WWR_Octopus.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Nit\u00eb", "created_at": "May 5, 2015 at 3:08am", "created_by": "Nita", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1267311", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1280553"}
