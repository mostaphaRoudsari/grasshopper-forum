{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks, I guess I really have to learn about OpenStudio.\n\n\n\nI have some questions regarding HB+.\n\n1. Is it intended to replace the old HB at some point?\n\nIf it is, then a lot of the code has to be rewritten right? Maybe we could help at some point? I think this would be a good opportunity for developers to learn the inner workings of LB/HB. I'm particularly interested in participating.\n\n\n\n2. I've been browsing through the code of HB+ (I'm assuming it's this: [https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybee-plus](https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybee-plus)), and I have to say that it looks really great with all the docstrings, PEP8 and even its own API documentation.\u00a0\n\nI was wondering if this is meant to work with a later version of GhPython/GH/Rhino (Rhino 6 maybe?). I remember from your video tutorials for developers... you've mentioned that at the moment, sc.sticky was used instead of import libraries due to some reasons.\n\nFor some reason, we're going the normal way of development. Maybe it's related to the upcoming Rhino 6? (I remember something like GH would already be part of Rhino with a better Python implementation or something like that).\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pin", "created_at": "January 26, 2017 at 5:08am", "created_by": "Pin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678531", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678755"}
