{"body": "\nHello everyone\n\n\n\nI am trying to generate grid-based daylight analysis and I have trouble setting my grid mesh on the floor. Please see the attached. I don't know why my analysis nodes are generated on a surface parallel to the wall rather than floor. And I don't know how to change the \"DIR\" to inside the box rather than outside.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks and I appreciate your help.\n\n\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1642221", "name": "Test2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 18, 2016 at 05:52PM", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "Setting The Grid for Daylight Analysis", "id": "topic_1642222"}
