{"body": "\nThanks, Abraham!\n\n\n\nCan the LB+HB developer team consider an option for the ****Run Energy Simulation**** component to **choose EnergyPlus version** so that people who don't have the latest EP due to computer admin control on installation can still enjoy using LB+HB?\n\n\n\nJudging from the .bat file for EP to run, this option can enable the users to specify which version of **Epl-run.bat** to use if they don't have the latest EP.\n\n\n\nOf course this is not applicable for some of the latest LB+HB components which may need to utilize the functions of the latest EP.\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 8, 2015 at 11:47pm", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1340195", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1340200"}
