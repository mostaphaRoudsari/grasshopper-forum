{"body": "\nWell ... not good news from here.\n\nI updated the file to the very last github components. The HB_IndoorViewFactor is failing with 1 warning and 1 error:\n\n1. Getting rid of interior walls has caused the connected zone geometry to not be closed.\u00a0 Try connecting all zones of your building or all zones for each floor.\n\n1. Solution exception:name 'testPtsInit' is not defined\n\nThe simulation is taking a lot and the results file is pretty big (~200Mb).\n\nThe component i connected for the EP simulation and IndoorViewFactor is the EPWindowShades (as opposed to those you have). Seems to me more correct. But still ... no success.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 17, 2015 at 05:59AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1225897", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1226035"}
