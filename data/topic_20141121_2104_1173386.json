{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI'm having issues with the solve adjacency function. In connecting multiple zones together, the zone programs get switched and not all interior walls become interior walls. Grafting vs flattening does change things a bit, but it doesn't seem work with the common convention.\u00a0\n\nAny ideas/suggestions on plugging multiple zones into the solve adjacency function?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kyle Vansice", "created_at": "November 21, 2014 at 09:04PM", "created_by": "KyleVansice", "topic": "Solve Adjacencies", "id": "topic_1173386"}
