{"body": "\nHi,\n\nIn doubt where to post this one (here or github) ...\n\nI have a file (attached) that simulates fine (E+). The thing is that the readEPResult complains like this:\n\n1. Failed to parse the result file. The csv file might not have existed when connected or the simulation did not run correctly.Try reconnecting the _resultfileAddress to this component or re-running your simulation.\n\nNeedless to say that the simuation ran fine, all the files are in the proper site and they are not 0 size.\n\nTo make it more interesting the readEPSrfResult accepts the same output file from the simulation.\n\nWhat is the thing i'm missing?\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1217134", "name": "Occupancy.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 4, 2015 at 9:01am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "readEPResult issue", "id": "topic_1217135"}
