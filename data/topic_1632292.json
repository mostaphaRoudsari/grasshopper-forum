(You know it is not an exterior shading device with thermal break. It is a continuous wall with significant heat transmittance)\n\n\n\nThe only way I could imagine to define the thick wall, is to divide it into two parts (interior and exterior), and then define each part as a zone! So 2 new zones would represent the wall. But these zones won't have any cavity or air inside; because the wall is solid. then the question would be:\n\nWhat is the minimum size of a zone? Could a zone be as thick as a wall (e.g. 50 cm width)?\u00a0\n\nWhat is the maximum thickness of a wall/floor/ceiling/etc. in a zone? Could they occupy the whole space of the zone? i.e. Could a wall have a width equivalent to half of the whole zone's width?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you\n\nAryan\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aryan Shahabian", "created_at": "November 3, 2016 at 4:40am", "created_by": "AryanShahabian", "topic": "Thick wall partly penetrating a zone", "id": "topic_1632292"}
