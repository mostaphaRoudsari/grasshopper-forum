{"body": "\nHello HB family\n\n\n\nI know that HB has great capabilities, that I might not be aware of. I would like to ask if it is possible to run parametric runs on E+ variables, such as:\n\n1- U-value of walls, windows\n\n2- Lighting Power Density\n\n3- HVAC system\n\n\n\nand other variables, which are basically assigned to the model via E+.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you very much for your help\n\n\n\nLadan\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "December 1, 2016 at 11:05am", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "Parametric Modeling of E+ Variables", "id": "topic_1650214"}
