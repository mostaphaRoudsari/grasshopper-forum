{"body": "\nI have been studying ways of using the \"Comfort Shade Benefit evaluator\", but the result I am getting (attached image) seems weird.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/aNZ9EZ3f4*zg-KVtiaNUzx8NjWtjRaGG9N1yvid96*X2UF8zqqcpNcutkpmkOTwouOAj*HZ94u27gQzyWrV015NNebVgyJfJ/Ladybug_ShadeBenefit01.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/aNZ9EZ3f4*zg-KVtiaNUzx8NjWtjRaGG9N1yvid96*X2UF8zqqcpNcutkpmkOTwouOAj*HZ94u27gQzyWrV015NNebVgyJfJ/Ladybug_ShadeBenefit01.JPG)\n\nAs written in the output red is harmful shade (not useful shade?) and blue where shade is helpful. If I look at the image/colors with my common sense I would say where there is blue color is areas where the shade is harmful because of the surrounding buildings creates shade, and the red areas is where shade would be useful. But the simulated result gives the opposite result I would say.\n\nInfo about the setup:\n\nThanks,\n\ndaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1331136", "name": "Ladybug_Shade-Benefit-01.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "daniel nielsen", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 01:29AM", "created_by": "arkdanielnielsen", "topic": "Q - Comfort Shade Benefit evaluator", "id": "topic_1331137"}
