{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nTo clarify, I have put a check into the component that identifies any vectors that are perfectly perpendicular to the window, discounts them, and gives a warning. \u00a0Luis is getting one of these warnings in his file and so, to some extent, things are working as we like.\n\nHowever, it is also possible to put in vectors that are \"close\" to being perpendicular, which are tough to identify but can nevertheless make the (sometimes buggy) Rhinocommon intersection calculations go crazy. \u00a0I don't know what exactly what counts as a \"close\" enough vector and I should investigate this in the future when I have time. \u00a0In the meantime, I worry about limiting people's freedom to input different vectors if I try to put in something to take out \"close enough\" vectors without understanding exactly what they are. \u00a0So user self-policing their inputs seems to be the best policy until someone gets time to investigate this.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 19, 2016 at 2:43pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1487170", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1488463"}
