{"body": "\nHI Folks,\n\n\n\nWhat would be the best way to study the impact of applying solar film inside a window?\n\n\n\nI am thinking adding a brep (maybe using a HB context shading) and locating it in the same plane as the glass and adjusting the transparency of the brep material. \u00a0Although I plan to apply the film on the inside of the window, I feel the effect would be as if the glazing and film are in plane. \u00a0Would this be a right assumption?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ibby", "created_at": "June 19, 2017 at 12:42PM", "created_by": "Ibby", "topic": "BEST WAY TO TEST IMPACT OF SOLAR FILM", "id": "topic_1771267"}
