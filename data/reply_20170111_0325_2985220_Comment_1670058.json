{"body": "\nHi Francesco,\n\n\n\nThanks for elaborating. I understand your challenge now. I don't know since how long it has been there, but as a matter of fact,\u00a0**Brep.JoinBreps Method** is being applied to the list of breps that one supplied to the _geometry input.\n\n\n\nSo, when you supply different variations of your building, they are being joined in one Brep for analysis, and I know you already have figured this now.\n\n\n\nA very quick option I think about right now is to use multiple sunlight hours components. I will still look further to find a more elegant solution.\n\n-Devang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "January 11, 2017 at 03:25AM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1669948", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1670058"}
