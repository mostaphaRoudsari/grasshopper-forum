{"body": "\nIf this for an actual project and not just a thought experiment, I think your solution might be overly simplistic. Both\u00a0[CIE 157:2004](http://www.cie.co.at/index.php?i_ca_id=433) and\u00a0[LG8:2015](http://www.cibse.org/Knowledge/knowledge-items/detail?id=a0q20000008I7kIAAS) (which appears to defer to CIE 157:2004) mention limiting illuminance and limiting exposure (lux hours). Hours with direct solar irradiance are likely to exceed the limiting illuminance thresholds, which range from (200 to 50 lux as per Table 3.4 in CIE 157:2004). It makes sense to consider direct illuminance (an ab=0 simulation in Honeybee)\u00a0 separately from a normal illuminance calculation.\n\n\n\nAssuming that the museum exhibits have low to high responsivity to light, an ideal solution would minimize direct sunlight. For daylight from the sky and reflected light, it might be enough to keep the illuminance levels below the recommended thresholds and then sum up lux-hours.\n\n\n\nDaysim, the annual daylighting engine used by Honeybee and DIVA, is not very accurate for direct-sun calculations. You will get more accurate results if you run your analysis with Radiance directly.\n\n\n\nInstead of considering the horizontal illuminance grids, one can create grids that correspond to the dimensions of the exhibit and then average those values. I think single points, as shown in your gh file might not suffice. Calculating lux-hours is by far the simplest part of such a simulation. It will only require averaging these points, extracting them into an array and then summing up that array.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 24, 2017 at 5:29pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1757076", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1757339"}
