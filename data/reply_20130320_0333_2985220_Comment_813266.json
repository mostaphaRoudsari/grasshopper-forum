{"body": "\nThat is indeed very gentle, much\u00a0appreciated\u00a0Mostapha :)<br/><br/>I spent most day yesterday getting\u00a0acquainted\u00a0with the plugin and its various components (and environmental solar analysis in general). Absolutely loving it so far. For some reason I always had the idea that performing this type of work would be highly involved, time consuming and, well, rather boring. Guess I was wrong. Also having it all right in GH really adds a whole other dimension to it. Again, great work!<br/><br/>After having kicked around a couple of simple test studies I see what you guys are saying regarding point number 5). Think I shall just stick to using Breps and the built in meshing routines for now. Other than that I was wondering if you might have any tips on reading material or links on when/how to apply respectively \"Sunlight Hours Analysis\" and \"Radiation Analysis\" when designing a shading system?<br/><br/>I found the following papers from links you posted here in the LadyBug forum:<br/><br/>[http://plea-arch.net/PLEA/ConferenceResources/PLEA2004/Proceedings/...](http://plea-arch.net/PLEA/ConferenceResources/PLEA2004/Proceedings/p1153final.pdf)<br/>[http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/Shaderad...](http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/Shaderade_BS2011.pdf)<br/><br/>Going through them now, however any other resources would also be greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>Hope I can help out on the Python side of things. I'll certainly keep a keen eye out for any bugs and such ;)<br/><br/>Best,\n\nAnders\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anders Holden Deleuran", "created_at": "March 20, 2013 at 03:33AM", "created_by": "AndersHoldenDeleuran", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_812724", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_813266"}
