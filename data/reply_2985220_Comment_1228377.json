{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\nI just ran the GH file that you uploaded here for the whole year without a problem. \u00a0The annual simulation took 40 minutes on my computer, which is quite powerful now so be warned that this is a long process. It also maxed out my memory \u00a0few times so I would really encourage you to run it for short periods at a time.\n\nHere's one of the result CSV files that you can use to plug into the \"Read Indoor Comfort Result\" component:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/r7zh3lvxfniywdj/unnamedOperativeTemp.csv?...](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r7zh3lvxfniywdj/unnamedOperativeTemp.csv?dl=0)\n\nThe issue seems to be specific to your system (or perhaps the weather file you are using). \u00a0Can you try running the attached GH file and tell me what the error message is?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1228378", "name": "OfficeTower_CWM_forTest.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 20, 2015 at 11:20pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228496", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228377"}
