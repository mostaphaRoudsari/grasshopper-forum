{"body": "\nHi Iman,\n\n\n\nThe easiest way I can think of is to create your glazing system with the LBNL Software and then import the gbxml file into Honeybee.\n\n\n\nIn the official site of LBNL there are instructions on which options you enable in order to produce an xml file. After that the software is quite straightforward. In the glazing system tab, you select the number of layers, type of glass (out of thousands in the available library), type of gap, etc.\n\n\n\nOnce you are done you just press the Calculate button and the file is produced. Using the available Honeybee component you can import it into your model.\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to assign your glass properties manually in Honeybee. That method is a bit more difficult because you would need detailed info. You can find that perhaps from the supplier (rarely the have reflectances though) or, again, you can extract it from LBNL Windows (bypassing in a way the creation of the xml file).\n\nI am not aware if there is any impact on the results between the actual xml file and using values (as it would be the case I guess when using no mass wall materials in E+). Perhaps someone more experienced can answer that one.\n\n\n\nHope this is helpful. Good luck!\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "November 29, 2015 at 05:36AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1411699", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1411702"}
