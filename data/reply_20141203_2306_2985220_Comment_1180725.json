{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha,\n\nI don't want you to fix this anymore ... until you get your other tasks done.\n\nThe fix here don't work well. It doesn't collect some other information from the IDF that is needed for the simulation. As a result it fails (see attached).\n\nI can create my idf without shades so it works fine.
