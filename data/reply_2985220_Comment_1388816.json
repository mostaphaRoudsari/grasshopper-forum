{"body": "\nHi Tim. The way the update component works is first to try to remove the current version, which it assumes is located in root of userobjects directory and then copies the new version. If you have moved them from the root folder then it will generate duplicate userobjects. We can change the code to handle cases like yours but my suggestion for now is to have the userobjects in the root folder until we apply the changes. If you use update component you don't need to use remove old version, since it does it by default.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 28, 2015 at 7:27pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1388041", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1388816"}
