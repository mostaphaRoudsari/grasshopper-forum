{"body": "\nHi to everyone!\n\nI'm using HB for Annual Daylight Simulation and I can't find .ill files in the folder. In fact the simulation doesn't run. I have a problem even with the mesh, even if I've used the same geometry for DF simulation. Could you help me, please?\n\nI attach the file too.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1685635", "name": "BW_annual simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Rosaria Revellini", "created_at": "February 05, 2017 at 08:41AM", "created_by": "RosariaRevellini", "topic": "Problem with .ill files", "id": "topic_1685636"}
