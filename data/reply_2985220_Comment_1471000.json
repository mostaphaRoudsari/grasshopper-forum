{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nThanks for the incredible tools. I am trying to understand how to use this type of definition to determine percentage of occupied space filled with a certain level of FC daylight.\n\nI would like to calculate the percent of space filled with a certain level of light. I dispatch the illuminance values and divide them by the total number of values. I believe this is correct? however I would like to display the area that has the level of exposure and am not sure how to do that. Is there a good way to do this?\n\nAlso when I set the bounds off the legend parameters to the actual bounds of the illuminance values I get a very limited display of light. I want to be sure I am displaying the correct colors ... can you advise? Thanks again! -Ethan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1471002", "name": "illuminanceAnalysis_02.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ethan", "created_at": "February 25, 2016 at 12:36am", "created_by": "EthanKerber", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1132812", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1471000"}
