{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nYou are the man! \u00a0If we are starting to discover bugs in E+, I would say that we have reached a new milestone! \u00a0I was not aware of a bug and that would be great if you could report it to E+ team.\n\nBefore doing that, I might just try checking to see if things change when the angle is changed and you are using a low slat width. \u00a0I might imagine that, regardless of the angle, if you have a really long slat width, not much light is getting through the window and so you would not see a change in results.\n\n\n\nTo answer your earlier questions, Abraham, you cannot use the\u00a0SingleGlazing object (define only U, SHGC and VT) with the\u00a0midplane\u00a0object (you probably already\u00a0figured this out). \u00a0The\u00a0midplane\u00a0object requires both panes of glass and air gaps on either side of it.\n\nI understand you desire for dynamic shades. \u00a0I have way too much on my plate right now and I don't think that I can get to it for a very long time. If you are motivated to tackle this in the interim, feel free to overwrite the implementation that I have done, especially if you find something better that accommodates all types of dynamic shades/blinds.\n\nIn the cooling loads comment, I just meant that a simulation run with blinds in the panes of glass had lower cooling energy than a simulation without blinds in the glass. \u00a0I have not compared blinds between glass to external blinds yet but I would imagine that external blinds would be better. Heating loads were also higher with the blinds.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 9, 2014 at 5:00pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184226", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184815"}
