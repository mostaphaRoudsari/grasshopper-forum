{"body": "\nHi Olivier,\n\n\n\nI think we need a little bit more time to make sure all the default values for the 'Heat Transfer' recipe is set correctly, and also provide a more comprehensive example on how to use it for examples such as the ones that you mentioned.\n\n\n\nHi Lasse, A comparative study between the results of your work and Butterfly will be quite variable. Except for the time that you need to run the cases it should take a very short amount of time to generate the options. I have to add that since Butterfly is using OpenFOAM to run the analysis, the first step is to look for similar comparative studies between Fluent and OpenFOAM. We can use your findings to compare, modify the default boundary conditions, however, you are able to set your own OpenFOAM boundary conditions as desired using butterfly. Also [check the comparison here](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Butterfly/issues/15#issuecomment-259799552).\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 29, 2016 at 9:51am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647654", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1648351"}
