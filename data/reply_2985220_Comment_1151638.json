{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\n1. In the results of the glare analysis colors are randomly assigned and has no meaning more than source of the glare. You can read it in evalglare documentation file as \"The color is chosen by chance, no significance is given by the color\"\n\n2. To understand the probability of glare you should check DGP values.\n\n3. The algorithms that are used in evalglare are based of studies for stationary desks and for indoor offices. I'm not sure if using them for an outdoor area will give you any meaningful results. I'm pretty sure that you have see that in Jan's presentations.\n\n- Mostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "October 18, 2014 at 11:20pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151213", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1151638"}
