{"body": "\nHi Mostapha! Won't be the first nor the last to say that the plug-in is incredible!! Thank you and keep up the good work!\n\n\n\nI have a question regarding the solar radiation analysis. I would like to analyse the solar irradiation on a surface within urban context, but as far as I understand the Ladybug_Radiation_analysis tool does not take reflections into account. I also need the hourly irradiation. Is there a way to achieve this with Honeybee?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mihail Todorov", "created_at": "April 11, 2015 at 9:43am", "created_by": "MihailTodorov", "topic": "Honeybee hourly solar radiation", "id": "topic_1260705"}
