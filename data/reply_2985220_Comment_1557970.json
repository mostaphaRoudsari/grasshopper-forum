{"body": "\nHi Chris!\n\nMy fault, you are right and with LegendPar you get the same legend. Thanks\u00a0a lot!!\n\nBut..another question:\u00a0how can I have a more visible difference\u00a0between one temperature to another?\n\nLet me explain: as you can see from the first image attached is really clear where the temperature is cold and where is warm. This was the results when i had the \"wrong\"\u00a0legend that was changing depending on the plotted values. Meanwhile, as you can see from the second image attached, the visual difference between temperatures is not so clear.\n\nI was trying to change the customColors, the gradIndex from the gradient component, the Buondaries, but is never so clear as in the previous \"wrong\" case..\n\nHave you got any suggestions? thanks a lot again!!\n\nThis Forum is ALWAYS so helpful!! :)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1557972", "name": "1.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1557973", "name": "2.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 30, 2016 at 7:35am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1558135", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1557970"}
