{"body": "Hi Dimitrios,\n\nI am pretty sure that I know why this is happening. It is because of the function that generates legends for all ladybug components.\n\nFor any legend in Ladybug, if the range from the highest to lowest values of the radiation mesh is less than 0.1, the legend is collapsed as this means that the legend would have to include values smaller than 2 decimal places. This feature was put in because a large number of decimal places could look weird in a lot of cases. Also, this was originally OK since most data that was viewed with the legend was larger than 2 decimal places. However, now that the hourly radiation is viewed in kWh and the legend is being used for EnergyPlus data now that sometimes have ever small differences, I would say that it is time to edit this function for small decimal place situations.\n\nI will try to get around to this soon and, in the meantime, you can get the legend range to be stable by using the ladybug legend parameters component.", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 15, 2014 at 06:53AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1116586", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1117011"}
