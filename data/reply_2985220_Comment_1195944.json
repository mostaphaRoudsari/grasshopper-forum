{"body": "\nAlejandro,\n\nI've been checking this and found that the problem is that the HB_DecomposeEPConstruction changes the case of the material names (or at least those with Capital). In such a way capital name and low caps are different, even though the \"letters\" are the same.\n\nThis is a bug that i suppose Mostapha/Chris will fix soon (right?).\n\nSee attached. Number 1 is your original case (more or less). Number 2 is a fixed case after changing back the case of the name. Numbers 3 and 4 show what i mean in my response above.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 30, 2014 at 3:17am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1196146", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1195944"}
