{"body": "\nHi Abraham !\n\n\n\nThe original data set that Mike provided has the same values for every day of the year..additionally, the values for\u00a0 06:30 to 12:30 for each those days is the same as 13:30 to 19:30..and additionally (again)..the value for diffuse radiation is assigned as a % of the direct-normal radiation..(see attached image #2).\n\nSo, my assumption is that the entire radiation data set of 8760*2 values is based out of just 7 empirically measured values. All of this still doesn't explain why the plot will turn out that way. I think I have figured out a bug. I will put that in a separate post..\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fZ7LFFJLJtO9R4W8mmL3EqJul81A7kVedIU7bRHj9NwwdZ28iLjM5E1Rk83fpub-8AO9zjPx31nT69j*jxOOlMDTsqFtnWUU/316201710159PM.png\" width=\"128\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fZ7LFFJLJtO9R4W8mmL3EqJul81A7kVedIU7bRHj9NwwdZ28iLjM5E1Rk83fpub-8AO9zjPx31nT69j*jxOOlMDTsqFtnWUU/316201710159PM.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/fZ7LFFJLJtPHG09bRu90-8h4yGobNa8qF7o9M*EUxSWhjANoysGCo*3ncat7KbimEeQjnyVxbD98UgcT*edNi17liGfRqiHA/316201710734PM.png\" width=\"495\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/fZ7LFFJLJtPHG09bRu90-8h4yGobNa8qF7o9M*EUxSWhjANoysGCo*3ncat7KbimEeQjnyVxbD98UgcT*edNi17liGfRqiHA/316201710734PM.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "March 16, 2017 at 11:10AM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714022", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1714113"}
