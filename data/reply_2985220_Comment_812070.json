{"body": "\nHi Anders,\n\n\n\nThe best answer would be given by Mostapha, but until he comes, maybe I could answer some of the questions:\n\n\n\n1) Yes you need to use the Meters, as the solar radiation results are in kWh/m2 or kWh.\n\n4) I think you are right - the vectors of the mesh faces need to be directed towards the radiation source.\n\n5) Not sure I understood you about the quad, but the center of each face represents the radiation point.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "March 19, 2013 at 4:53am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "topic_812250", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_812070"}
