{"body": "\nBuongiorno Jacopo,\n\n\n\nFor some reason I can't reply directly to your answer (must have reached the maximum reply limit), but yes this is helpful.\n\n\n\nI had already checked the err file and I knew I had problems, but mostly I was freaked out by the fact that it was always in wireframe. I fixed a couple of things, including two HBZones that carried the same name and manage to import it in OS. Then I painfully and slowly cleaned everything in OpenStudio since all my attempts at doing it in Rhino had failed.\n\n\n\nOne thing is that I redrew the geometry using the architectural Rhino model as guide... Turns out the architectural model wasn't very precise and a lot of stuff ended to be non planar.\n\nThese are Rhino questions and not a GH/HB one, but I'll ask them anyway.\n\nif I use \"Planar\" mode (command \"planar\" in Rhino), will that ensure my surfaces are planar or does object snapping take precedence?\n\nAlso, is there a way to force (transform/simplify) a closed brep with some non planar surfaces to only have planar surfaces? For example, I had a few boxes that had very minor offsets (&lt;1cm) but turned out non planar as a result...\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Julien Marrec", "created_at": "March 26, 2015 at 07:52AM", "created_by": "JulienMarrec", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1250120", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1250493"}
