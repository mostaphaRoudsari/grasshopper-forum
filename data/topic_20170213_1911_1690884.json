{"body": "\nHi all!\n\n\n\nI have come across an error related to a **regular situation\u00a0**for outdoor comfort. I have not found any information in the forums, hopefully someone can throw some light on it.\n\n\n\nI am working on an outdoor microclimate analysis for a public square. I am using the create EP ground component with different soil types \u00a0(Asphalt, Water, Concrete, Grass..) to calculate variations on radiant temperatures with EnergyPlus.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo far, the easiest way I found to get the grass material was through the Material:roofvegetation energy plus object, as defined by Chris on\u00a0\n\n**[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Green_Roof_In_Energy_Model&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)**\n\n**\u00a0**\n\n**[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/C*P8XcSSeqc2BhXA6ZGHyp6UZUiVd0t07*i4v1t24L0vtvi3bi0Y*OaMpTuy-azOlGsUiH*HeRj0lcZRAjGH4ShMSfKrpA64/GrassMaterial.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/C*P8XcSSeqc2BhXA6ZGHyp6UZUiVd0t07*i4v1t24L0vtvi3bi0Y*OaMpTuy-azOlGsUiH*HeRj0lcZRAjGH4ShMSfKrpA64/GrassMaterial.JPG)**\n\n**<br/>**1. Do you think this is the best way to specify grass for certain areas of the square in this type of analysis?\n\n\n\nThe problem comes later down the process, with the Indoor View Factor Calculator, as it does not recognize the roughness of the grass material. I tried changing it to Rough or Smooth, but the error persists.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/C*P8XcSSeqfzFJ35FzLx6UdFAthfovpGe23jRvlV*1lPfitJ8cP6uZ-ni6rZLfZz7KE*NJoCZJ45g-BK-IMTP1vg4HWOlWOv/ViewFactorMesh_Error.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/C*P8XcSSeqfzFJ35FzLx6UdFAthfovpGe23jRvlV*1lPfitJ8cP6uZ-ni6rZLfZz7KE*NJoCZJ45g-BK-IMTP1vg4HWOlWOv/ViewFactorMesh_Error.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Does someone know a way around this problem?\n\n\n\nPerhaps there is a better method to define the grass so that the error is avoided, or maybe it has to be implemented in the code. I have had a look at it, but my python skills are quite limited and didn't see any way of fixing the issue.\n\n\n\nI also attach the .gh definition,\n\nBig thanks in advance!\n\n\n\nRafael\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1690883", "name": "SquareMicroclimate.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Rafael A.", "created_at": "February 13, 2017 at 07:11PM", "created_by": "RafaelA", "topic": "Indoor View Factor Calculator - Problem with Grass (Material: RoofVegetation) Roughness", "id": "topic_1690884"}
