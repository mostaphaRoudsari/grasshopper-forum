{"body": "\nIll just keep posting my issues here in hopes someone notices. I solved the thick wall issue by modelling the thick wall in rhino.\u00a0\n\nThe question now is how was honeybee daylight factor results validated? I ran a honeybee calc and and an IES calc with the same parameters. On the attached images the grid is not really matching but you can see the divergence anyway. Some honeybee results are 100% better than ones from IES. Can anyone tell me why? Im not great at Radiance, but maybe there is a set of settings where results would converge? \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dmitri Korolenko", "created_at": "July 11, 2016 at 05:13AM", "created_by": "DmitriKorolenko980", "parent_id": "topic_1561483", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1563943"}
