{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nthank you.\u00a0\n\nActually what I'm trying to evaluate the most are the primary energy need for CHL the room. So, It is more important to estimated the solar gains/loads coming from the window with different types of shadings applied.\u00a0\n\nIf we consider that after 5 cm between two elements the air can move and so the thermal resistance dropped to zero, I think I can avoid to consider the surface temperature of the shading.\n\nContrariwise, I constructed thanks to HB also a Daylight Simulation (UDI/DGP) in order to evaluate the visual parameters. It will be important to estimate either the amount of light passing through the shades.\n\n\n\nYes you're right about the WSG component. My mistake!\n\n\n\nThank you for the kind support,\n\nMarco\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marco P", "created_at": "January 23, 2015 at 06:22AM", "created_by": "MarcoP", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209552", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1210126"}
