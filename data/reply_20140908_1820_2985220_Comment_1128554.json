{"body": "\nHi again Aaron,\n\n\n\nNo worries. As I said I totally understand that we don't have enough resources and it can be really hard to get started. The good news is as soon as you understand the logic behind Honeybee it is pretty straight forward.\n\n\n\nSo I started with the hard one. There were minor mistakes/bad practices in the file that i fixed in Grasshopper file. There was also a modeling issue with the way you had the window modeled. In EnergyPlus windows (child surfaces) cannot touch the edge of the walls (parent surfaces). I trimmed the glazing surfaces and now it works fine.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/nd24W9ECLPObBDFN13*m8TAXg0jRAwMWswxDJHXdOE-9brYwYx5AapPu7hMBsuSypzhL8sgEW513iZs--ijlCtlc0RvmBUYK/glazing_correction_Perspective.png\" width=\"620\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/nd24W9ECLPObBDFN13*m8TAXg0jRAwMWswxDJHXdOE-9brYwYx5AapPu7hMBsuSypzhL8sgEW513iZs--ijlCtlc0RvmBUYK/glazing_correction_Perspective.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nI also have a recommendation for you to simplify your geometry. Honeybee is capable of exporting geometries like yours to EnergyPlus but simulation will take very long as EnergyPlus is not really designed for complex geometries. I will check your simple case soon.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1128555", "name": "ExampleAnalysis_Honeybee2_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 08, 2014 at 06:20PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1128544", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1128554"}
