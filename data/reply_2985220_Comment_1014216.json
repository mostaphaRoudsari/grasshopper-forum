{"body": "\nHi Ante,\n\n\n\nThanks. The ideal solution is to develop a component that generates the legend as a graphic (and not a geometry). I tried it a number of times and it is not that hard to create the legend however it is really hard to dispose! You can easily end up having the legend up there with no way to remove it. This is something that I can give it another try later but I hope someone else does it before me! ;)\n\n\n\nThe current workaround is to find coordinate of a Point2D on the screen and then use that as the legend basepoint. It will work as far as you animate in a single viewport. Attached is a quick and dirty example. It should work as far as you are creating gentle camera moves!\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1014218", "name": "reMaplegendBasePt.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 23, 2014 at 3:01pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1014211", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1014216"}
