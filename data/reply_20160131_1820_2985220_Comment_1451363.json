{"body": "\nHi Tim,\n\nGreat to see that you've started learning Honeybee too. I checked your file and I also get the error. The error is honeybee error and not related to OpenStudio or EnergyPlus installation. It's probably the results of some recent changes for making zone evaluation faster. I added an issue to Honeybee to fix it soon. It seems to only happen for double curvature surfaces.\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/467](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/467)\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 31, 2016 at 06:20PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1451041", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1451363"}
