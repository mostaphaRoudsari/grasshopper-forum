{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI am running a daylighting simulation for a simple room.\n\n\n\nI have created all the surfaces one by one, created the glazed surface and joined everything on one zone.\n\n\n\nI also created a shading surface, the effect of which I want to try on the DF factor output of the daylighting simulation.\n\n\n\nI noticed that by taking the shading surface off the inputs the result was almost identical, which isn't logical for a 1.8m horizontal shading of a 3m window.\n\n\n\nMy question is where should I input the shading surface. I tried inputting it into the daylight simulation component along with the HBZone that was created and also adding it as an input to the create zone component which then I connected to the DF component. Results were again identical.\n\n\n\nI believe I must be doing something wrong on the flow. Any insights on this?\n\n\n\nI am attaching the definition, currently run with the second flow (shading surface into zone, zone into DF component).\n\n\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1223004", "name": "Daylight&Glare_B1.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 12, 2015 at 1:05am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Honeybee and Daylighting - Shading Surfaces", "id": "topic_1223005"}
