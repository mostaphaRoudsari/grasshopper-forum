{"body": "\nHi everyone :)\n\n\n\nI get really weird radiation analysis results and I don't understand why... I tried switching to a different epw, cancelled the \"type hint\" options on all the components (which seemed to be the problem last time), checked the srf dir, switched surfaces (made a new surface and inserted it into GH)... didn't work.\u00a0\n\nWhen I connect a different polysurface from the same Rhino model it does work. Any ideas?\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1547141", "name": "Capture.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1547142", "name": "Radiation Analysis_helpfile.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Adi K", "created_at": "June 13, 2016 at 2:47pm", "created_by": "AdiK", "topic": "Error using LB Radiation component", "id": "topic_1547143"}
