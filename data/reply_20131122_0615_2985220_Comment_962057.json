{"body": "\nNice! No problem. Thank you for bringing it up.\n\nWeights define the importance of the view point. Just an input to give some freedom to user to use the component as they wish.\n\nLet's say you are testing for 4 viewPoints. In that case normally each viewPoint has the importance of 1/4 (25%), however in some cases you want to consider 100% view if you can see any of the points. You can use the weights input in cases similar to this. If you put 1 as the weight you are telling the component that if a testPoint sees this point it has 100% view. There is no true or false method in assigning the weights. It is all about your definition of view.\n\nHope it explains the idea to some extents. I owe you a video on this anyways! :)\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 22, 2013 at 06:15AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_961763", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_962057"}
