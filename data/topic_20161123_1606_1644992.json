{"body": "\nHello all\n\n\n\nI would like to pick my sensor in a floor plan, which is composed of multiple zones. I used \"Item list\" and picked a number and connected that item to my test points in Annual DL Simulation.\u00a0\n\nI totally understand this process when I had one zone, but now that i am working on multiple zones, I think that I don't have control to pick the middle point in each space. The points change when I change my \"Item\" number, but I cannot pick a specific one for each space.\n\nPlease see the attached graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\u00a0\n\n\n\nladan\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1644989", "name": "HB-Pick Sensor.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1644990", "name": "HB-Pick Sensor_Code.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1644991", "name": "2-SecondEnergySim.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 23, 2016 at 04:06PM", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "Pick Sensor for Annual DL Analysis in Multiple Zones", "id": "topic_1644992"}
