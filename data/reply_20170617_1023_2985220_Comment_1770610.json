{"body": "\nHey Omid,\n\nThank you so much :) it works fine now after copying the updated components in my original file.\n\n<br/>I did update the components via the HB&amp;LB-Update-Components earlier though (wich gave me a version of Feb). But you updated them to May. So did you edit them manaually or how else did you update them?\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nDominik\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dominik Simon", "created_at": "June 17, 2017 at 10:23AM", "created_by": "DominikSimon", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1770165", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1770610"}
