{"body": "\nHi Ding,\n\n\n\nGiven that I am not able to replicate the error on my machine and that the error is happening on a line of code where libraries are being imported from grasshopper, I would guess that you are getting that error either because your GHPython or your grasshopper version is not up-to-date. \u00a0Try updating these and let me know if this fixes it.\n\n\n\nAlso, Mostapha. \u00a0I have changed LB_LB such that users will get a warning to update LB_LB now instead of having the component go red as in Ding's image. \u00a0The update can be found here:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/ad64d70c427bcc15...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/commit/ad64d70c427bcc153a53cc33121240c297138170)\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 11, 2014 at 8:36am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1113724", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1113646"}
