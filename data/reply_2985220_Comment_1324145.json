{"body": "\nHi Theodoros,\n\n\n\nI probably can help you with questions 1, 2 but for 3 and 4 you should wait for Chien Si.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to have non airconditioned spaces within the model? I tried bypassing the OS Systems component and link directly to the simulation component but that only applied ideal air loads to the zones.\n\n\n\nYes. You need to set isConditioned to False and also bypass the systems as you mentioned.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to have multiple systems within the same model? If yes, should I just use multiple OS Systems and PlantDesigner components for each system?\n\nYes. Just pass different zones from different components and assign the desired system to the zone.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 11, 2015 at 2:08pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1291281", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1324145"}
