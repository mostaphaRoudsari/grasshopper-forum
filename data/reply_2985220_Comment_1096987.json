{"body": "\nThanks Mostapha, I solved this problem. There was a mistake in assignment of material name.\n\nThe results (daylight factor) that I obtained with Honeybee are different from the radiance results. Is this possible? Materials and parameters selected are the same in both analysis. For example 1.4 with Honeybee and 1.9 with Radiance. In the case without shading sheets the value is about 2.8, smaller than I expected.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your attention.\n\nBye\n\nAndrea\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrea Zani", "created_at": "July 3, 2014 at 3:23pm", "created_by": "AndreaZani905", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1096592", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1096987"}
