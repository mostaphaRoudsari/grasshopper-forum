{"body": "\nHi Alireza,\n\n\n\nDefinitely!\u00a0Curious to know more about your web-based 500+ analysis project.\n\n\n\n1. I'm using Radiance for converting HDR files. I can't see any option for PNG in Radiance files. I will check wxfalsecolor source code.\n\n\n\n2. The component already masks the values less than 0.1 but not for contour line or contour band images ([here](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeybee_FalseColor.py#L126)). Now that I opened up the other options it makes sense to have masking threshold as an input. I will try to apply it tomorrow.\n\n\n\nAnything else that you can think might be helpful?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 12, 2014 at 5:41pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1043232", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1043149"}
