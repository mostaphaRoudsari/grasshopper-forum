{"body": "\nHi Michal,\u00a0\n\nResults are different at the end. I made sure to have the same weather file this time. The size of each sample I tried to make the same. In ecotect, I divided the surface into 50mm squares. In ladybug, I've setup the sample to be taken every 50mm. (Ecotect generated 17712 panels, Ladybug 17856) I ran both tests from 8am to 6pm, everyday for the entire year. If the sky is pre-calculated, ladybug is much faster in analyzing. About 3 times as fast.\u00a0\n\nNext I will do the same test, but non-shaded. I guess it would be crucial to see if the difference is the same. I am not so concerned about the actual numbers, but about percent differences.\u00a0\n\nIlya\n\nPS I posting screenshots. If you see errors let me know.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1108804", "name": "ecotect_model.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1108805", "name": "ecotect_results.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Ilya Bourim", "created_at": "July 31, 2014 at 1:54am", "created_by": "IlyaBourim", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1108756", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1108803"}
