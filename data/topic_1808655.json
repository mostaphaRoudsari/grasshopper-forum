{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nFairly new to Ladybug, but seems amazing :) !\n\nJust wondering - is there a way to change the upper and lower bounds of the visibility analysis? If I don't have any values between, say 50-100%, it would be useful to compress the colour coding if the analysis to between 0-50% to get more variation...\n\nchanging upper / lower bounds of the legend parameter didn't seem to do it ....\n\n\n\nmany thanks,\n\nPeter\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "peter", "created_at": "September 4, 2017 at 4:11pm", "created_by": "peterfeldmann", "topic": "Range of Analysis", "id": "topic_1808655"}
