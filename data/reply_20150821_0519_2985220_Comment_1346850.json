{"body": "\nArie,\n\nI just realized in my sleep that there is a much more accurate way to get an MRT Delta from a Honeybee Radiance simulation, although you can do it for only one human\u00a0geometry\u00a0and one hour at a time.\n\nAll that you use the solar adjusted temperature component for is to generate a human geometry mesh. \u00a0Then, you just run this human mesh through the Honeybee Radiation simulation. \u00a0You can use the\u00a0radiation\u00a0values that\u00a0you get out of the simulation to compute an Effective Radiant Field (ERF) using this forumula:\n\n\u03b1LW * ERF = \u03b1SW * Esolar\n\nFinally, you can convert this ERF to an MRT Delta using this formula:\n\nERF = feff * hr * (MRT - Ta)\n\nBoth formulas are taken from the original paper that I used to make the solar adjusted temperature component:\n\n[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/89m1h2dg#page-4](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/89m1h2dg#page-4)\n\nThis is what it will look like when you get a result with this method:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/t3tIV4vY4Jojj8MNfA9RdzYl4GMIfIYk*XMi0dtpPXJhNPmXU5mMo2obwE1JiO1KStpVwdWlHfNUxBQSQ-RvZ1BDD-fraZ0W/MRTDeltaWithRadiance.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/t3tIV4vY4Jojj8MNfA9RdzYl4GMIfIYk*XMi0dtpPXJhNPmXU5mMo2obwE1JiO1KStpVwdWlHfNUxBQSQ-RvZ1BDD-fraZ0W/MRTDeltaWithRadiance.PNG)\n\nAnd attached is a GH file that will calculate the UTCI for your case.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1346851", "name": "ComfortableAnalysis_v1_CWM2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 21, 2015 at 05:19AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1346731", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1346850"}
