{"body": "\nHi,\n\n<br/>My problem isn't really with the GH file as such (although I couldn't work out why everything went red on the add glazing component either - incidentally when I opened your file it was all red again!).\n\n\n\nInstead my biggest problem is that I can't get the glazing to add to the surfaces using the add glazing component. I don't know what to do to get the glazing to add to the surfaces. Could someone please outline the steps that I should take in Rhino and Honeybee to add a window to a specific surface. Currently I have been (i) creating a planar surface and then (ii) extruding that surface to make a closed geometry/zone in Rhino and then (iii) drawing a new surface over the top of the particular surface that has a window in it and then (iv) changing the size of that new surface to match the size of the window in the building. I then (v) import the zone from (ii) into grasshopper and then (vi) decompose it into surfaces and then turn the window into a brep and add it to the surface using the add glazing component. This process seems to work for about 75% of the windows in the building, but I can't get the other 25% of windows to add onto the surface in grasshopper/honeybee. I am sure it is because the window and the surface are not planar, but I don't know how to check this or to make them planar in Rhino. Can someone please tell me how to do this?\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chelle Payne", "created_at": "March 21, 2016 at 10:00pm", "created_by": "ChellePayne", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1489297", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490020"}
