{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI can't thank you enough for the time you put into HB and to answer all comments like mine :)\n\nHopefully I will have some time to get through the comments I found weird in the next weeks ! Should I creat a new discussion on the forum once I did that ?<br/><br/>for other issues :\n\n- For T\u00b0 controls, I think it is possible to specify the type of thermostat in the room such as this example :\n\n\"ZoneControl:Thermostat:OperativeTemperature, !- Defines zone temperature control type<br/>Bloc1:Zone1 Thermostat, !- Thermostat name<br/>Constant, !- Radiative Fraction Input Mode<br/>0.50, !- Fixed Radiative Fraction<br/>; !- Radiative Fraction Schedule Name\n\nSee also :\u00a0[http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-4/input-output-reference/gr...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-4/input-output-reference/group-zone-controls-thermostats.html)\n\n\n\nI am however not sure of the exact implication of such a change.<br/><br/>For shading geometries, I am using this method right now (thanks for this !)but just thought it could be simpler to add it to HB EP context surfaces component directly.\n\n\n\nfor the other questions, apologies foe the lack of work on my part :)\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nA.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aurelien Keller", "created_at": "January 24, 2017 at 2:57am", "created_by": "AurelienKeller", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1677336", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1677381"}
