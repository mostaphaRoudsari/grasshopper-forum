{"body": "\nDomenico,\n\nI am sorry for the late response. \u00a0Your thinking is spot-on with the intended use of the THERM workflow but you are also far ahead of the current development. \u00a0I haven't gotten as much time as I was hoping in the last couple of months to finish off the basic export workflow let alone the import back into GH (hence, the placement of the components in WIP). \u00a0However, with a bit of a lull in office work now around the holidays, I think that I should be able to put a good number of hours in the next few days. \u00a0Wherever I end up getting to by the end of this week, I will post an example file on the [Hydra platform](https://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/index.html)\u00a0and post here once I have done so.\n\nFrom my research so far, I can tell you that THERM will write the U-value of the assembly into the THERM XML file that the components will generate (the \"thermFileAddress\"). \u00a0So, once we get the basic export working, pulling out the assembly U-Value into GH for an EnergyPlus simulation should be pretty straightforward. \u00a0The difficult part will just be understanding how to distribute this U-value around the mass of the construction. \u00a0For this, we may need some components that help us translate some THERM materials to EP materials such that we can decide which material of the construction will account for the thermal bridging with a decreased R-value. \u00a0We will cross this bridge when we get the basic export workflow in place (no pun intended).\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 28, 2015 at 5:41pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1425862", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1427648"}
