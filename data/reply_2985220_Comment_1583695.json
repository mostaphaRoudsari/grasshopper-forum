{"body": "\nJuila,\n\nThis is, indeed, very unfortunate. \u00a0We (Honeybee developers) have not experienced this bug for several versions of OpenStudio and we had hoped it was behind us.\n\nDo you have any earlier versions of OpenStudio installed? \u00a0Or openstudio dlls in your ladybug folder? If so, please uninstall/remove them.\n\nJust to be sure, can you upload your GH file so that we can be sure that the issue is specific to your system?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 18, 2016 at 11:22pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1583774", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1583695"}
