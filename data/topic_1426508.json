{"body": "\nHi all\n\nI got the results of daylight simulation in the room in lux. the results(in 3 different times of the year) are between 100-3000 lux, with some parts near window,\u00a0approximately\u00a0in range of 20000-40000 lux\u00a0\u00a0but know I have problem in analysing the annual results. I checked it in lux and DF, but the UDI results seemed different.\n\nIn the range between 500-2500 lux, the UDI is 0.0 for each point in the room. and 98% is more than range(more than 30000). but its not normal.\u00a0\n\ncould someone help me?\n\nthank you in advance.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1426506", "name": "001.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1426507", "name": "IRN_Shiraz.408480_ITMY.epw"}], "created_by_name": "masoumehta", "created_at": "December 26, 2015 at 8:35am", "created_by": "masoumehta", "topic": "UDI results", "id": "topic_1426508"}
