{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI have the latest version of Ladybug and Honeybee installed in my computer and working fine until this morning !! When I turned my computer this morning, the LB and HB components are missing from the tabs bar as shown in the screenshot\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ExlLp5DNAJ8DDwSIZTK32ENmkx*VxySg5ycaLFbCxdppTfThNbQhrYg8anreJmqtoOQQ30-Wt1Thv4T-TxW-WlIrlqhmxg4V/Untitled.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ExlLp5DNAJ8DDwSIZTK32ENmkx*VxySg5ycaLFbCxdppTfThNbQhrYg8anreJmqtoOQQ30-Wt1Thv4T-TxW-WlIrlqhmxg4V/Untitled.png)\n\nWhen I checked the User Object folder, I can see all the files there. I removed LB&amp;HB and reinstalled it and still the same issue. When I open an old script, I can see all the components in GH canvas and I can run the script.\n\nHas anyone faced this issue before? Or do you know how can I fix it?\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nMohammed \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mohammed Alshayeb", "created_at": "September 08, 2017 at 09:52AM", "created_by": "MohammedAlshayeb", "topic": "LB&HB missing components", "id": "topic_1810759"}
