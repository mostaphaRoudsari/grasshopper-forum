{"body": "\nHi Andrea,\n\nI think I need more information to be able to help you. Can you connect the readMe outputs to a panel and let me know what does it say.\n\nDid you select a valid weather file as the input?\n\n768ms for genCumulativeSky doesn't look right. It my fail to download gendaymtx.exe on your drive. Something should fail in that component. If you capture an image similar to image below it should be easy to fix your problem.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/UbQGb2BFO*Xe33uDojTks34762CgjyDSSV0mtWjnnW*qOdd2IinAOHKWu4FDA8DDwoKxkJsCwPa04ZkxUBY4*9iYLZkHEvmB/selectSkyMtx.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/UbQGb2BFO*Xe33uDojTks34762CgjyDSSV0mtWjnnW*qOdd2IinAOHKWu4FDA8DDwoKxkJsCwPa04ZkxUBY4*9iYLZkHEvmB/selectSkyMtx.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 18, 2014 at 07:05PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1028329", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1028289"}
