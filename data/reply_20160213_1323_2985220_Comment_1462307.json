{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThank you for your reply :) it was useful for understanding some things, but I am still confused about the Honeybee component that generates CIE skies,\n\nas in the image, it has six CIE sky types and I understand the difference between them, but for the intermediate one I am lacking the exact type, as far as i understood from the attached paper (table 1) there are several types between the sky with uniform illuminance and the CIE clear sky, do you have information which one is it in the component?\n\nI also have abbreviations from CIE illuminants, like D65, and so, do you know the abbreviations of these skies?\n\nThanks in advance,\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1462309", "name": "CIE.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1462510", "name": "CIE skies.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Maha Shalaby", "created_at": "February 13, 2016 at 01:23PM", "created_by": "MahaShalaby", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462244", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462307"}
