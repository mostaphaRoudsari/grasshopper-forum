{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks for your answer. For me the option of editing the text is not a must, but i can understand that this can be important for other users.\n\nI was using a different option for baking before you implemented the wonderful bake options lately. It uses some of the Human plugin. It is not working smoothly, as for the colored result meshes. Also the text is not editable. See attached. Yours is much better, besides the text in perspective.\n\nSo for me, whatever option that is easy to implement will be very fine.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1492629", "name": "ImprovedViewCalculator+HumanBake.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 26, 2016 at 12:01AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1492265", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1492627"}
