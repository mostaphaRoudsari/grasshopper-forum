{"body": "\nHi again, Sarith\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply. Clearing up some points:\n\n1. What do you mean by \"That is why the candela values are visualized in the Rhino viewport\"? Are you refering to the luminance analysis (cd/m^2), or am I missing something? I think it would be very useful to have a mapping of light intensity over the field of view of the used camera, and possibly and option to overlay it on the luminance mapping. It would in a very visual way provide information about contrast and glare.\n\n\n\n4. It's just a shoebox type simulation. 11x11 luminaires pointing down to simple materials. The default elapsed time was 3m40s. I have found the _RadParameters component meanwhile, and got it down to 0m30s. I have noticed that the simulation doesn't tax multiple cpu threads completely, most of the time cpu is at 25% during execution.\n\n\n\n5. Is it possible to map different degrees of translucency, diffuse color, absorptance, reflectance, etc..., by means of a bitmap image, expression, or other?\n\n\n\n6. There is a feature that I consider absolutely necessary (and I haven't found it yet), which is the emitting surface feature, with the ability to stipulate homogeneous intensity with luminance values (in cd/m^2) or flux; and by mapped distribution of intensities or luminances (in cd or cd/m^2).\n\nBy emitting surface I don't mean just a flat rectangular plane, such as an area light. It would be absolutely amazing! to perform photometric analysis on irregular and convoluted shapes and the light falling on neighbouring surfaces. 3DS Max with MentalRay provides similar functionality, but without the power of GH + HB.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the more I use HB, the more I like it! Have a great year!\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aristo Compasso", "created_at": "January 06, 2017 at 05:22AM", "created_by": "AristoCompasso", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1664226", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1667740"}
