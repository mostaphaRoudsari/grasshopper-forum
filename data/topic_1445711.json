{"body": "\nHi Chris and Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThe attached file is a workflow to calculate outdoor thermal comfort at 2m height using UTCI, following your workflow for microclimate mapping ([http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Outdoor_Microclimate_Map&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)).\n\n\n\nIn your workflow, the ground zone is directly used for solving adjacency with all the building mass. However, it was not used to intersect with the building mass before this step. I wonder if it is appropriate.\n\n\n\nIn my workflow, the ground zone is included, with all building mass, for intersecting and solving adjacency, and now the top surface of the ground zone is identified as a roof surface.\n\n\n\nIs this procedure correct or necessary?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LjtdpeZIE4m-p47O6K*X1bQyEvHKfqDAtXMbQEjg7xpDpeWfj9s81gZ-*cmar5Jg6Ej89s3O5uk5Dw7Ok-53hLLuWLsR0y*a/Capture.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/LjtdpeZIE4m-p47O6K*X1bQyEvHKfqDAtXMbQEjg7xpDpeWfj9s81gZ-*cmar5Jg6Ej89s3O5uk5Dw7Ok-53hLLuWLsR0y*a/Capture.PNG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LjtdpeZIE4lCW4BztfDRdmpKkwNkrkU*9gs1wo2jIRxO-QePIQ*jwPf8WszG3FrQ1J21rFxSt1Menj6VvcFf3g*kqpuyuS5v/2.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/LjtdpeZIE4lCW4BztfDRdmpKkwNkrkU*9gs1wo2jIRxO-QePIQ*jwPf8WszG3FrQ1J21rFxSt1Menj6VvcFf3g*kqpuyuS5v/2.PNG)\n\nThank you very much!\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1445710", "name": "typology_v036.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "January 23, 2016 at 5:21am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "microclimate map - should ground zone be included for mass intersection?", "id": "topic_1445711"}
