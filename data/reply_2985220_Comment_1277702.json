{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Theodore,\n\n\n\nI notice that you are trying to conduct energy simulation based on daylight calculation in Honeybee. Actually, I am now trying to do the same thing, but I encountered some\u00a0difficulties in linking the\u00a0lighting schedule\u00a0to the energy simulation in a proper way.\n\n\n\nMy problems are listed here:\u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/read-ep-res...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/read-ep-result-results-are-missing-in-the-new-version?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1277590&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\n\n\n\nCould you please share some of your\u00a0experience with me? Thank you in advance!<br/>\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "April 30, 2015 at 1:36pm", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "topic_1230617", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1277702"}
