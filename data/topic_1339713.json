{"body": "\nHi,\n\nFirst of all, great work on these plugins - much fun to work with them.\n\nTo verify the method to calculate hourly radiation on surfaces, I tried to compare the results of EPlus (what I would traditionally use) and to those of Ladybug.\n\nI was hoping they would match (or be at least close), but they seem off. The two analyzed surfaces are facing west so there should be no radiation in the morning, but the Ladybug method shows otherwise - unexpectedly.\n\nI use the same weather data file and geometry (I import the DXF file from EPlus to rhino).\n\nFor some time I have been trying to figure out why these results don't match, but I am at a loss.\n\nI have attached both the DXF file (simple geometry of a surface with an overhang faced west), a weather data file (Jerusalem in this case), the grasshopper file and an excel sheet with the results from both software (I use TT toolbox to write to an excel).\n\n\n\nAny thoughts on what I might have done wrong?\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\nGuus\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1339712", "name": "Comparison Eplus vs Ladybug.zip"}], "created_by_name": "Guus Gooskens", "created_at": "August 7, 2015 at 4:21am", "created_by": "GuusGooskens", "topic": "Unexpected results ladybug on hourly radiation on surfaces", "id": "topic_1339713"}
