{"body": "\nElly,\n\nIt sounds like an interesting presentation! \u00a0Many technologies are inherently social phenomena at their core and software projects like Ladybug + Honeybee are defined more by a community than by the software itself. \u00a0The code is more an artifact of the ongoing interaction of people on these forums and the real technology is in the minds of these people who apply and develop it.\n\nAs such, I find many barriers that slow the implementation of new processes and workflows like those of LB+HB are also social in nature and some of the most effective efforts to overcome these barriers have more new social resources rather than new software features. \u00a0For example, things like [documentation](https://www.gitbook.com/book/mostapharoudsari/ladybug-primer/details), [example file sharing](https://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/index.html), and [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6HWbF4UtdKdjbZ2tvwiCQ/playlists)\u00a0are oftentimes just as important if not more so than the code.\n\nTo second Theodore's comment, I am very interesting in understanding your take on it if any of your presentations will be available online.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 18, 2015 at 9:42pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1423247", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1423678"}
