{"body": "\nHi Sarith, If you haven't already figured it out here is how you can do it.\n\n\n\nHoneybee has a function exportView that does export the views. You can easily modify the function to do what you need: ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeyb...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeybee_Honeybee.py#L2446-L2578))\n\n\n\nIn case you don't want to deal with the code, you can connect multiple view names to imageBased recipe. Then only set writeRad to True. All the views will be written in the file in the rpict line and you can copy-paste them into your file.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 12, 2015 at 4:32pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1281926", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1308250"}
