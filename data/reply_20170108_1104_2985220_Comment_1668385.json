A simple sunlight hours study with culled sun vectors for hours below the illuminance threshold will suffice. This is exactly what this example file is showing here:\nhttp://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&for...\n\nThis should be much faster than running DAYSIM.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 08, 2017 at 11:04AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1667723", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1668385"}
