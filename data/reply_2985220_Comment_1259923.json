{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,<br/>thank you for your reply.<br/>I would like to keep the data structure I created with the DivideSurface component. This is probably not the optimal solution, but I want to organize the test points by lines (along either u or v direction). My data tree is then structured as {building;surface;line).<br/>I tried to create a mesh for each surface but the mesh faces cannot be unflattened as the vertices.<br/>I attach the file. I hope it is clear.<br/>Any help would be much appreciated.\n\nGiuseppe\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1259924", "name": "testpoints_line.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe Peronato", "created_at": "April 9, 2015 at 9:22am", "created_by": "GiuseppePeronato", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1259814", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1259923"}
