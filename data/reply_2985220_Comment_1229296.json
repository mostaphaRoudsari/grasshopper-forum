{"body": "\nHi Burin- I remember we had a discussion about this before the last release. I don't know about the video but in general you should be able to setPt and setBack with Honeybee. I can't check the file right now but I will get back to this discussion soon. Looks like a bug to me &gt; ([https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/286](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/286))\n\nThanks!\n\nMostapha\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 10:39am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1229050", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1229296"}
