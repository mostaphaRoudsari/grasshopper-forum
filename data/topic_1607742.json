I could explode the data tree but that would require a single 'NDbFA' component for each zone.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/5R3yBX2dACVS7J4Qb4moTZMcF8lgketRgE2WzHFykwGzgxKU8HH9DSxhWcz*nOn*WixS0rEWvrRVZBuJVfTQ3Oxc8cyDQEOY/zzzz.JPG\" width=\"519\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/5R3yBX2dACVS7J4Qb4moTZMcF8lgketRgE2WzHFykwGzgxKU8HH9DSxhWcz*nOn*WixS0rEWvrRVZBuJVfTQ3Oxc8cyDQEOY/zzzz.JPG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "huntan", "created_at": "September 29, 2016 at 12:50am", "created_by": "huntan", "topic": "Read EP Result | Normalize", "id": "topic_1607742"}
