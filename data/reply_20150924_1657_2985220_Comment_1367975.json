{"body": "\nHi Anton!\n\n\n\nI'm literally just learning python coding so if you are already able to code this then that would be great! My university has a processing lab of computers which they are giving me access to to run the parametric study and fully use honeybee/ladybug. I do feel like I need to get my head around coding to better understand it as my supervisor is having me do demo's of the program for other students and external consultants to introduce them to the capabilities of parametric design! Exciting times, but having this ability would greatly help the practicality of it within research for sure.\n\n\n\nMuch appreciated if you are able to do this!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Elzine Braasch", "created_at": "September 24, 2015 at 04:57PM", "created_by": "ElzineBraasch", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1368132", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1367975"}
