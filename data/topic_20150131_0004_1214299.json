{"body": "\nHi Everyone!\n\n\n\nI am currently involved in the very early design stages of a fairly large mixed-use development that will comprise of a number of neighbourhoods. It is a rare case where environmental assessment comes before design. My goal is to use both tools in their full capabilities and perhaps suggest (I would say create if I could code a line) new ones.\n\n\n\nI was wondering about if there is already a capability of Heat Island Effect assessment in ladybug. Solar adjusted radiation modelling seems to approach something similar. I have seen variables such as material absorption. I realize that usually a CFD simulation is performed to assess Heat Island Effects but such a simulation could be enhanced with data provided from Ladybug or perhaps it could be done completely in the tool.\n\n\n\nA simple checklist of the top of my mind, just as a brainstorming exercise, would be:\n\n\n\n- percentages of softscape and hardscape materials in the area\n\n- thermal properties of all materials (SRI, absorption, U-values, etc.)\n\n- Leef Area Index of softscape (to account for shading from greenery)\n\n- Water bodies and/or irrigation (to account for evapotranspiration)\n\n- Open sky views, to account for reflections of light between surfaces that trap heat\n\n- Roof and glazing reflectance of buildings (I'm guessing that is already somewhere there).\n\n- Wind assessment to account for blockage, turbulence, etc. (this is essentially the CFD?)\n\n- ...\n\n\n\nI am quite new to the tools, and the scene, so I hope this topic makes a bit of sense (i.e. it can be in the least feasible or not already completely provided).\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 31, 2015 at 12:04AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Heat Island Effect", "id": "topic_1214299"}
