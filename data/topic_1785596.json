{"body": "\nHello\n\n\n\nI am having a problem running honeybee and I see an Runtime Error; Win32Exception.\n\nThe problem started when I uninstalled HB/LB and reinstalled the new version, and now I am getting the error.\u00a0\n\nFrom Radaince, Eplus and OpenStudio, I ONLY re-installed OSM again to save it in C:\\program files rather than the automatic location that it selects. My radiance and Eplus are the same old ones.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy radiance is located in C:\\radiance\n\nOpenStudio is in in C:\\program files\\Open studio\n\nEnergyPlus is in C:\\EnergyPlus V8.5\n\n\n\nI read a previous post about this error but that did not solve my issue.\u00a0\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/honeybee-ru...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/honeybee-runtime-error-win32exception?xg_source=activity)\n\n\n\nIn another example file from Hydra, when I connected a panel to my Honeybee component, \u00a0I saw:\n\nFailed to sort OpenStudio installation folders. I don't know if that is the same problem or not.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWould you please tell me what could be causing this error?\u00a0\n\nI appreciate your help.\n\nLadan\n\nAttachments:\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1785594", "name": "Win32.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1785595", "name": "Win32-2.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "July 18, 2017 at 1:56pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "topic": "Honeybee Runtime Error: Win32Exception", "id": "topic_1785596"}
