{"body": "\nHi Omid,<br/><br/>The reason for this error is a bug with calculation of tilt angle.<br/>It\u00a0[has been fixed](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/xn/detail/2985220:Comment:1482064) in March this year, while your \"Ladybug Ladybug\" component is from January.<br/><br/>I replaced your \"Ladybug Ladybug\" component with the [newest version](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/userObjects/Ladybug_Ladybug.ghuser).<br/>The error should not appear now.<br/><br/>Btw. the shape of that building looks interesting!
