{"body": "\nHello Michal,\n\nas we said few time ago I post a video about the studies i am doing (it is a very short part of all the simulation). The goal is that to find the optimal layout of three buildings inside a plot. The scope is that to have the maximum direct sunlight hours hitting the facades of the three buildings. So I used the Ladubug Sunlight hour component (in the way it is possible to see at the beginning of this post) to obtain the sunlight hours for each building and in each of this one building is the geonmetry and the other two are the context (after that I got to know that it is possible to do everything also with only one component and not three). So I used the Galapagos evolutonary solver used in Maximize mode. I am still working on this, in the videao you can see the three towers ca just shift inside the plot, in a new simulation I am working on they can also rotate.\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n<iframe _origwidth=\"420\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/HMOKcO_KNJU?wmode=opaque\" width=\"420\"></iframe>\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "July 2, 2013 at 9:32am", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_868255", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_880646"}
