{"body": "\nJames,\n\nYou were using an older version of the annual schedule component and a lot has been updated with this component since August. \u00a0Once you sync your components with the github, your setpoints work fine:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/iHTeMy8PBD3obv5Ny1qLdQ*vHO2G6JEwx*M-iHNlbu7HlE-IOgvWtuPM4Xbszv7k7Xxq-RnrTooZggMFyNsRzRlqVKoBWivF/SchedulesWorking.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/iHTeMy8PBD3obv5Ny1qLdQ*vHO2G6JEwx*M-iHNlbu7HlE-IOgvWtuPM4Xbszv7k7Xxq-RnrTooZggMFyNsRzRlqVKoBWivF/SchedulesWorking.JPG)\n\nAlso, if you are interested in having a constant setpoint, you can do this much more easily by inputting a single value into the \"Set Zone Thresholds\" component instead of making a whole schedule as you have done in this file. \u00a0The zone thresholds component was a lot more stable in the last release. \u00a0Finally, the CSV schedule component is another method for \"setting points\" that has been stable for a long time.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1683957", "name": "Testingsetpointschedule_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 2, 2017 at 5:16pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1684040", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1683955"}
