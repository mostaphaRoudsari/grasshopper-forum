{"body": "\nHi Ugur,\n\nI played a bit with your files. First of all, as Mostapha said, there are a LOT of surfaces with their normals pointing inwards. Those are not small changes in the results. But saying that, i don't understand why you think the results are not making sense. I find them pretty logic. I recommend you to increase the resolution of the analysis grid (you have 4, i set 2, but recommend even smaller). In some cases may be confusing seeing one color supposedly wrong just because the calculation was done on the center of the face. In your case this is clear specially on those \"terraces\" on the north (they are north?) side.\n\nAlso i recommend to show the legend and even more than that to set a fixed scale for the legend so you can have all visuals comparable with the same scale.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-A.\n\n\n\nPS. Mostapha, question for you: For the RealTimeAnalysis component to work well there is need to execute the GenCumulativeSkyMtx for the whole year (analysis period)? In Ugur's case he has only one day, one hour. I'm not sure about the relation between the results, so i'm wondering.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "November 19, 2013 at 8:09am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_960068", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_960512"}
