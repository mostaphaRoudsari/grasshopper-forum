{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to run Ladybug on the Rhino 6 WIP (Windows) and am having some issues.\n\n\n\nEverything runs fine when I use Rhino 5, but when I try to plug the\u00a0**location** component into\u00a0**sunpath,\u00a0**I get \"1. Solution exception:The method or operation is not implemented.\"\n\n\n\nI've already tried to update to IronPython 2.7.7, but don't think I'm doing it correctly (when I check the version using the GhPython script, it returns that I'm using version 2.7.5). I've been working with a collection of different solutions, each of which I think I've implemented about halfway to completion. Is this a consistent problem with running Ladybug in the newest Rhino 6 WIP? I've never worked with Python and haven't gotten deep into the guts of anything besides installation of grasshopper plugins, so there's a high chance I'm missing something obvious. If it's just fixing the IronPython installation, does anyone have a link to more specific instructions on how to ensure that Rhino 6 is using the 2.7.7 version?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Scott Deisher", "created_at": "March 18, 2017 at 8:09pm", "created_by": "ScottDeisher140", "parent_id": "topic_1608402", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1715527"}
