{"body": "\nHi, thank you very much,\n\nwhat I checked up now by simulating with daysim in W, and reading the LookupDaylightFolder, the values turned out to be in W. That's great. But I simply can't find any way of getting my 8760 values as Watts for every surface (with 1152 control points each) I'm simulating.\n\nI appreciate all the components to work with for reading annual results, but I have to create my own internal-gain-csv for very specific reasons. How can I get out an excel - sheet with 8760 values in Watts I can continue to work with?\n\n\n\nThanks for your hints!\n\n\n\nDaniel\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1324809", "name": "getting out 8760 W-values.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1325110", "name": "sc.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Daniel Podmirseg", "created_at": "July 13, 2015 at 2:37pm", "created_by": "DanielPodmirseg", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1321378", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1324807"}
