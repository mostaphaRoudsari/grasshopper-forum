{"body": "\nHi All,\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have the results from a daylight analysis calculation than took 3 hours to run. The grasshopper file created a mesh of locations at working plane within the building with a direct view of the sky and clips this to a threshold. However, I accidentally quit the application before baking the mesh results.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have the .pts files and the .res files (6 of each as I used 6 CPU's in the calc). Is it possible to re-import these back into the model rather than re-running the calculation?\n\n\n\nmany thanks\n\n\n\nNick\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Devlin", "created_at": "August 16, 2016 at 05:11AM", "created_by": "NickDevlin", "topic": "Importing previous daylighting results", "id": "topic_1582384"}
