{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nAnnual Daylight simulations take hours to be done, I am working with Rhino 5 64-bit and trace_dc.exe is 32-bit, is there a way the plunging can be installed in 64-bit to be able to use all my CPU's for the simulations? Any other way you recommend to work around thins will be great too.\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\nBlanca\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Blanca Dasi Espuig", "created_at": "July 23, 2015 at 06:50AM", "created_by": "BlancaDasiEspuig", "parent_id": "topic_1216749", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1331330"}
