{"body": "\nAs we are getting closer to March for Science on April 22, we wanted to share our support and encourage everyone in our wonderfully scientific community to participate in this global event!\n\n\n\nLadybug Tools is built on top of EnergyPlus, Radiance, THERM, and WINDOW, which are all the outcome of government-funded science research projects over the last few decades. We owe the vibrancy of our community to the scientists who built these engines and they truly are the giants upon whose shoulders we stand. \u00a0As we continue to bring the fruits of these scientific labors to the built environment, now is the time to show our support for what is near and dear to all of us in our Ladybug Tools community.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"https://cdn.bonfire.com/thumb/design-image/8881d4db-b86c-4e7f-9ede-e3fdfabb5df3/7329f207-b69c-4f7e-8322-9f628fd81358/?size=900\"/>](https://cdn.bonfire.com/thumb/design-image/8881d4db-b86c-4e7f-9ede-e3fdfabb5df3/7329f207-b69c-4f7e-8322-9f628fd81358/?size=900)\n\nWe have started a [bonfire campaign](https://www.bonfire.com/march-for-science-ladybug/) to fundraise for the event and so that we can all get \u00a0\u201cladybug tools\u201d T-shirts for the march! \u00a0We will donate %100 of the profits to the [March for Science](https://www.marchforscience.com/).
