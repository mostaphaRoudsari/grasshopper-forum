{"body": "\nRight, makes sense that different material values with the same name would be in conflict.\n\nAlso, that document was very helpful in clarifying a few items.\n\nI'm curious about the hemispheric sampling. If I'm interested in spherical sampling of a space, how would that work? I noticed that the results are highly dependent on normal of the surface used to generate the sample points and mesh. This poses a problem when looking to get a good idea of how light behaves in an open space like an atrium sampling in section (see images above).\n\nWould you generate results for the two hemispheres and combine results additively?\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "will krzymowski", "created_at": "December 11, 2014 at 1:04pm", "created_by": "willkrzymowski", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183807", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1186107"}
