{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nPerfect now!!\n\nOpportunities is a great word. Like it a lot.\n\n\n\nFor now, what are the definitions that are dumped and loaded? Just geometry? Didn't understand what yo wrote about the materials/constructions.\n\nBy now you'll say that the stage where you better do the dump is after the solveAdjacencies? Even there some definitions can be lost (materials, others)?\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for this one.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 9:12am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462705", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462872"}
