{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI have been trying to model ETFE cushions for EP and Radiance. For Radiance I am introducing manually results as produced by LBNL but for EP I have my doubts if a representation of a single layer using \"windowMaterial\" component is enough as ETFE cushions have a different behavior than that of a glass window. Especially when it comes to model more complex ETFEs with extra (shading/printed) layers and varying behavior during time I think that any simulation that is currently available is not representative enough. Any ideas/thoughts? \u00a0\n\n\n\nI am attaching a paper \"ENERGY MODELLING OF ETFE MEMBRANES IN BUILDING APPLICATIONS\" from H. Poirazis et al\u00a0explaining the \u00a0behavior of ETFEs (p. 701) with with a frit intermediate layer as a reference. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you in advance\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1412404", "name": "ETFE_Paper from IBPSA.pdf"}], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "November 30, 2015 at 05:36AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "topic": "ETFE simulation_ EP and Radiance", "id": "topic_1412405"}
