{"body": "\nHi Decian\n\nFirstly, you can try using meteonorm to get interpolated meteorological data closer to your area of interest. Alternatively, you may use 'elements' ([http://bigladdersoftware.com/projects/elements/](http://bigladdersoftware.com/projects/elements/)) to adjust the EPW using local mean monthly values if you get them from another source.\n\nIf you are working at the micro scale (eg a park with surroundings) you could calculate the shadow effect of trees on human comfort, on surface temperatures and the heating/cooling loads of buildings using E+. There are ways to account for the variation in tree seasonal transmissivity. If material porosity is implemented in butterfly you could do a CFD analysis as well. Currently there is no way to account for tree evaportranspiration using ladybug as far as I am aware. The other, non ladybug, alternative is Envimet, which is not suitable for mesoscale studies and now even the full academic version costs money.\n\nPerhaps you might want to look at Dragonfly and the Urban Weather Generator for morphing a rural EPW into an urban one. It does take into account trees and vegetated building surfaces but it makes a lot of simplifications/assumptions. Other more complete solutions at the mesoscale level are UMEP (free- still under development) and SURFEX, both of them are quite complicated.\n\nI hope you find this information useful.\n\nAris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aris V", "created_at": "March 23, 2017 at 01:56AM", "created_by": "ArisVartholomaios", "parent_id": "topic_1718518", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1718870"}
