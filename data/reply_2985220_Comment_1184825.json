{"body": "\nHi Evangelos, I think there are three different questions here.\n\n1. How can you add artificial lights to your scene: Look for \u00a0IES2HB component and also read this discussion:\u00a0[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/simulating-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/simulating-ies-lamps-file-through-rad-materials)\n\n\n\n2. How to generate lighting schedule (= when do you need to have the lights on?): If you run an annual analysis and use read Annual Results I, there is an output for annual profile that also include lighting schedule. Check Honeybee example file for annual analysis.\n\n\n\n3. Analysis for light diffusing panels (which is the topic of your discussion): You can create and apply translucent materials to your panels and they will diffuse the light.\n\n\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 9, 2014 at 6:48pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1183326", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184825"}
