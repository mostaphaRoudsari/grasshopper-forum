{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI would like to know if anybody knows a good way of controlling natural ventilation based on the difference between Indoor and Outdoor temperatures in an energy analysis.\n\nI thought this was how\u00a0****Honeybee Set EP Air**** **Flow** worked but apparently not as it still opens the window when T(out) &gt; T(in) (I get positive heat gains in this case).\n\n\n\nI basically want to use sensible natural cooling when possible and relevant, i.e. when the 2 following conditions are met :\n\n\n\nI know this is possible in EP but I have the feeling it is not yet implemented in HB ? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nAurelien\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aurelien Keller", "created_at": "January 30, 2017 at 12:19pm", "created_by": "AurelienKeller", "topic": "Natural Ventilation Control", "id": "topic_1681159"}
