{"body": "\nHi All,<br/><br/>I have questions about radiation analysis. I succeed to visualize the radiation onto my surface ('LB' image). However, once I add geometries (ex: buildings), the result becomes strange. It seems the analysis only happen near the building/geometries (see 'LB2' image).\n\n\n\nAlso, can someone explain me how's the '_disFromBase' measured? especially if I have non-planar surface. Is it measured from the lowest/top elevation of the surface or the center of my surface?<br/><br/>thank you in advance.<br/>best,<br/><br/>T\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1772676", "name": "LB.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1772677", "name": "LB2.png"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1772678", "name": "Radiation Analysis-Lady Bug.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Tan Malaka", "created_at": "June 22, 2017 at 1:42am", "created_by": "tanmalaka", "topic": "[Questions] Radiation Analysis", "id": "topic_1772679"}
