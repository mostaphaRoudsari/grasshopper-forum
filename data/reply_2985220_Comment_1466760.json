{"body": "\nDan,\n\n\n\nI didn't copy anything into Rhino (or bake). I internalized all the meshes that were produced into a 'mesh' bucket. Using the indices - which would be the same as the ID number - I would be able to relate the quantitative data to the the 3D mesh, i.e. mesh ID 1 would extract index 1 or row 1 of the respective values. The downside of that workflow though is you would be storing anywhere from 1000 to 3000 solutions which would make your gh file significantly large.\n\nConcerning weights: I didn't dive into that part but through 'filtering' you do somewhat subjectively add weight to solutions, e.g. solutions that perform in the 95th percentile of daylight, etc.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-Y\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yassin Ashour", "created_at": "February 19, 2016 at 3:50am", "created_by": "YassinAshour450", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1466855", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1466760"}
