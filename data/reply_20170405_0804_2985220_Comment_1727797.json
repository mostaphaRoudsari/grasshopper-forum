{"body": "\nHi Mikael,\n\nThe assumption with additional rad files is that they are stationary and so the north direction doesn't affect their rotation. However you can rotate the geometries inside Grasshopper before using Mesh2Rad. You don't need to create Honeybee surfaces in that case. Is that going to work for your case?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 05, 2017 at 08:04AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726998", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1727797"}
