{"body": "\nHi there!\n\nWe are working on a university project about lighting design and daylighting evaluation for an office building located in Trento (Italy).\n\nWe are currently performing a daylight analysis and calculating the daylight factor and everything works when we consider only the geometry of the building itself.\n\nOne of the tasks that we want to furhter implement is the insertion of the surrounding environment (the office is located near a mountain area).\n\nWe modeled the mountain using the geo-location function of Sketchup, imported the geometry into Rhino and created the surface.\n\nThen we added the mountain to grasshopper throug a brep, but then it is no longer able to run the simulation.\n\nIsn't Grasshopper able to handle such complex surfaces? Or are we doing something wrong?\n\nYou can find the gh file we used attached to this message.\n\nThank you in advance!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1572572", "name": "prj_prova.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Giacomo Luddeni", "created_at": "July 28, 2016 at 6:13am", "created_by": "GiacomoLuddeni", "topic": "daylight simulation using complex surfaces", "id": "topic_1572573"}
