{"body": "\nDimitrios,\n\nThanks for the clarification about the PV request and I'm sorry to have given so much pushback. \u00a0Climate and energy are complex sciences where it can be difficult to get accurate results but they seem to pale in comparison to economics. \u00a0Hopefully, someday we get databases of economic data that can match the usefulness that we pull from the DOE's climate database and, until then, it seems the best we can do is make our own GH definitions from what we find in our own localities and times in history.\n\nThe error seems to be happening because of your Ladybug Default Folder. \u00a0Do you have LB_LB flying and, if so, what is your default folder?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 12, 2015 at 7:26pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223819", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1223656"}
