{"body": "Abraham,\nWhat is the URL of the weather file that you are trying to download? It's possible that it might be an old URL that no longer exists (the US Dept of Energy moved the EPW database location a year and a half ago). With this last release of Ladybug, we stopped supporting the auto-updating of these old URLs to the new DoE database in the Open EPW and STAT component. We did this to try and get everyone using the new URLs.\nCheck if you can download the URL manually and ,if you can, then we'll start investigating other possible explanations.\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 01, 2017 at 06:22AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1790885", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1791957"}
