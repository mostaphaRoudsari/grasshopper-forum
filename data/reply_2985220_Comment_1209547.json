{"body": "\nSaeran,\n\nEverything that you posted is awesome and that paper from my school is super-interesting. \u00a0There is another developer named Boris who has been working on something similar for Ladybug. \u00a0With his method for generating the solar envelope, you will put in context breps of neighboring buildings that require solar access instead of taking everything outside the boundary of the site as requiring solar access (what happens currently). \u00a0Last I checked, his calculation times were huge and he was trying to get this down but it seemed like he would have it ready in the near future. \u00a0I will try to remember to post back here if he is nearing completion.\n\nJacob VDR,\n\nIn the meantime, if you are looking for a method that is going to be really sensitive to surrounding context, I think that your best bet is to do sunlight hours studies (I know that it's a different method but it's the best that we have right now). \u00a0The ability to select out specific solar vectors that Mostapha pointed out is only useful for qualifying the type of solar access you want (ie. for vegetation, for daylighting, etc). \u00a0The idea is that you can use the sunpath to select out sun vectors based on radiation or outdoor illumuinance and then plug those into the solar fan/envelope. \u00a0As they stand right now, the solar fan and envelope components are not made to be sensitive to variations in surrounding context and they thus treat all surrounding context as uniform.\n\nI hope that this was helpful,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 22, 2015 at 5:41pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209525", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1209547"}
