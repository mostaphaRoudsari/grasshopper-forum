{"body": "\nHello Ladybug Forum!\n\n\n\nI am attempting to analyze outdoor comfort for a project and account for the solar radiation. Using Ver 0.0.62, the SolarAdjustedTemperature default analysis period is noon for the winter solstice. I would like to calculate an hourly data set for a given time period so I attempted to use the 'analysisPeriod' component. When connected to the SolarAdjustedTemperature, it resulted in the following error: \"Local variable \"analysisTime\" referenced before assignment\".\u00a0\n\n\n\nI appreciate any advice in tackling this issue.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1506036", "name": "SolarAdjustedMRT error.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Kit Elsworth", "created_at": "April 11, 2016 at 10:34am", "created_by": "KitElsworth", "topic": "SolarAdjustedMRT and Analysis Period", "id": "topic_1506037"}
