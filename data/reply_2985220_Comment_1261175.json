{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Thanks for your reply.\u00a0<br/><br/>It seems like my system has some problem. I've uninstalled and re-installed latest version of HB and LB, however the result is same.\u00a0\n\n<br/>I am using Rhino5 sr 11, Grasshopper 0.9.0076, EnergyPlusV8-2-7 and my OS is windows 7.\n\nThis time i've used small box shaped building, and drag &amp; drop all my components instead of copying from the old file. I have a warning message from Honeybee Run E+ report which is same as below.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/qk*MmDQsK7qIJq7MNaeL9AQcFFT4wxEEVaFxG49OeioP8ZvRTHj6hvxDXaptNy2wSszRXsBRH7zpHleS70N81hkYLs94X7VG/Help_2_1.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/qk*MmDQsK7qIJq7MNaeL9AQcFFT4wxEEVaFxG49OeioP8ZvRTHj6hvxDXaptNy2wSszRXsBRH7zpHleS70N81hkYLs94X7VG/Help_2_1.jpg)\n\nAnd this is the overall definition:\u00a0<br/>[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/qk*MmDQsK7ocM84tsOIkdYDg2lJLndezgXgIpiEDW2hV5tq5OMm72Msm8v159G0fpfncHZ9tbFc5d5LXGFkqqfITKtLzWXrc/Help_2_2.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/qk*MmDQsK7ocM84tsOIkdYDg2lJLndezgXgIpiEDW2hV5tq5OMm72Msm8v159G0fpfncHZ9tbFc5d5LXGFkqqfITKtLzWXrc/Help_2_2.jpg)\n\nDon't know whats the problem is but my guess is the version of energy plus V8_2_7? Cause the Honeybee_Honeybee component is the one you modified for Energy PlusV8_2, not from the original downloading directory.<br/><br/>One thing I've observed is when i boolean toogle E+ simulation on, the calculation windows pops up and disappears so quick. I'm not sure its working properly.\n\n[<br/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/qk*MmDQsK7qIJq7MNaeL9AQcFFT4wxEEVaFxG49OeioP8ZvRTHj6hvxDXaptNy2wSszRXsBRH7zpHleS70N81hkYLs94X7VG/Help_2_1.jpg)What should i do next to make it work? I can uninstall my rhino and everything or installing it on other computer to check if it works...\n\n\n\nHere is the new definition link:\n\n<br/>[https://www.dropbox.com/s/lvvnfipqpum7b4p/Honeybee%20issue2.gh?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lvvnfipqpum7b4p/Honeybee%20issue2.gh?dl=0)\n\n<br/>Regards.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "April 12, 2015 at 1:14am", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1260918", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1261175"}
