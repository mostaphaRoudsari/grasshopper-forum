{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt's taking upwards of 4-5 minutes, so I was wondering if something was wrong. Sounds like something might be up then if it's only meant to take several seconds?\n\n\u00a0\n\nI'm hopefully getting a PC upgrade in a few days so I'll be able to compare. It should be a fresh install of Rhino/GH/LB+HB so that might fix things up as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCheers\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ben Foster", "created_at": "September 24, 2014 at 04:51PM", "created_by": "BenFoster", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1136657", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1136843"}
