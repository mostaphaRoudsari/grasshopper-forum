{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for the answer. Sorry for the late reply.\n\n\n\nIndeed that is exactly what i was thinking. Even though I was excited when I was acquainted to NetLogo and ABM, I do realize that ABM can be a bit hip atm as it is being introduced in more and more fields. I also realize that thermal conditions of a space are not the only determinants for human behaviour. So I would not attempt to model human behavior right away in that sense.\n\n\n\nFrom the very limited review I did I also thought the way to go was to use research out there that approximates behaviour on specific human tasks by statistics, like the example you gave. I was actually reading an interesting thesis that included statistical formulas for a\u00a0 wide range of actions within a building. I could compile a set of these formulas and step functions for a few different rules if you want. Cause I think your idea of using the if/then rules will give allow a different kind of modeling of adaptive behaviors.\n\n\n\nNow time to go see if I can acquire that book somehow :)\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore Galanos.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "December 15, 2015 at 11:39PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1420565", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1422153"}
