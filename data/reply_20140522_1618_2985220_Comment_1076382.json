{"body": "\nHi Orn,\n\n\n\nTo get the daylight factor you can generate a sky with a certain horizontal illuminance value, run the analysis and then divide the results with the sky value. -B is the key that let you do this.\n\ngensky 12 4 +12:00 -c -B 55.866 will generate a sky with 10,000 lux (55.866 = 10000/179)\n\nCheck Radiance gensky documentation for more information.\n\n\n\nAlso, can this be directly related to dynamic daylight metrics such as daylight autonomy?\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if I fully understand your question for this one. Are you asking if this is how dynamic daylight meters get calculates? Daysim uses daylight coefficient method to run the annual analysis which you can read more about it in the publications that you can find on their website.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 22, 2014 at 04:18PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1075230", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1076382"}
