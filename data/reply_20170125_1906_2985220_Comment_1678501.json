{"body": "\nI also have this issue but I didn't try to fix it. Still using version 5.\n\nTo find the version open a GHPython component and type:\n\nimport sys\n\nprint sys.version\n\n\n\nIf you have Dynamo installed then you have another version of IronPython installed under Program Files folder. You can find the version like this:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/GZs8qdvnOuHKg*lw7UKaXKDiJRP*vdon83zcOSeVhRaLVACWffdJ6cBsXG*sQ6ziA3n4p*CQb9G79OCv8FufJ2ZSJ9tn2cUb/IronPython_Version.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/GZs8qdvnOuHKg*lw7UKaXKDiJRP*vdon83zcOSeVhRaLVACWffdJ6cBsXG*sQ6ziA3n4p*CQb9G79OCv8FufJ2ZSJ9tn2cUb/IronPython_Version.PNG)\n\nAs far as I read in other discussions the version of IronPython should be the same as the version of IronPython on Rhino 6. I will test this at some point myself and report back here. If you don't use IronPython in Dynamo just uninstall the IronPython which is installed in Program Files folder and everything should work fine.\n\n\n\nHope it helps.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 25, 2017 at 07:06PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678433", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1678501"}
