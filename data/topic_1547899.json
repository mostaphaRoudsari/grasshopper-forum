{"body": "\nThis is weird. Chris' Tutorial showed that it was possible to automate glazing even for curved geometry.\n\n\n\nI'm planning on automating the creation of glazing for the 'twisting tower' on the file, however it can't create the glazing part. I also tried it on a Rhino cone, it also didn't work.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/VnW*2ykEnrMaM723-wEzaT9ce*SYmqG4qHb*e6Sq8sZvlOE9ZL7brUtYPJ0rgwvDUXE7l5FJhIP*sDd9256Td8GpMexwk3AY/Untitled.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/VnW*2ykEnrMaM723-wEzaT9ce*SYmqG4qHb*e6Sq8sZvlOE9ZL7brUtYPJ0rgwvDUXE7l5FJhIP*sDd9256Td8GpMexwk3AY/Untitled.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1547898", "name": "Glazing_divide_by_zero.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Pin", "created_at": "June 15, 2016 at 3:33am", "created_by": "Pin", "topic": "Glazing by Ratio on curved geometry -- error: attempted to divide by zero", "id": "topic_1547899"}
