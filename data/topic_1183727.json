{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nTesting some illuminance results for NY, in a typical office module, I get some results that look weird. Trying June 21st, Dec 21st and look ok. March 21, 23, 24 and so on looks like there is very sharp change which looks wrong, as March 20 looks smoother transition and correct.\n\n\n\nCould you pleas advice if there is something wrong with the results?\n\n\n\nI attach the relevant files.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDimitris\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183724", "name": "Illuminance_Results_Comparison.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183725", "name": "Illuminance_March_21_NY.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183726", "name": "Grid_Based_Day_Analysis_HB_01.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "December 8, 2014 at 10:09am", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Illuminance Results check", "id": "topic_1183727"}
