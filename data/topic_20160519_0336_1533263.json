{"body": "\nHi All!\n\n\n\nI have a complete energy model ready and running. However, there is a need to assign separate EP glazing construction on one facade and keep as it is on others. Now, since I have the complete model ready, I do not want to start everything from scratch (surface-by-surface). Is there a way to assign separate EP construction to separate surfaces after energy model creation?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nRam\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ram Joshi", "created_at": "May 19, 2016 at 03:36AM", "created_by": "RamJoshi", "topic": "Modifying EP construction after zone creation", "id": "topic_1533263"}
