{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI am trying to run a design optimization that is centered on luminance level of a certain hour in a year. I know I can run the annual simulation through Radiance and use Honeybee Read Hourly Results to load hourly data, but since I have more than 80,000 design options to run through this might take too long. Would it be possible just to get data of a certain hour without running the annual simulation?\n\n\n\nOr, if Ladybug radiation analysis doesn't consider reflection, is there some open academic source that can help me understand how reflection works and how to add up the values? I have done works mapping where bouncing light would reach in a room with a grid system out of Grasshopper and VB before, but I don't know how it works in terms of energy.\n\n\n\nThank you!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Weishun Xu", "created_at": "July 6, 2017 at 2:13am", "created_by": "WeishunXu", "topic": "Is it possible to simulate luminance level for a certain hour?", "id": "topic_1779346"}
