{"body": "\nNick,\n\nThe issue is that the OpenStudio component does not (by default) request outputs to be written into a usual CSV file. \u00a0You have to make sure that you have these surface outputs requested by enabling your \"Generate EP Ouptput\" component, which you see I have done in the attached feile.\n\nLet me know if I am understanding your issue correctly. \u00a0I notice that you have a bunch of other stuff next to the generate EP Output component that seems to be referencing stuff on your machine.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1372018", "name": "Xmas _5.3.1 _CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 01, 2015 at 08:08PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1370806", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1372017"}
