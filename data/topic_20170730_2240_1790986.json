{"body": "\nHi,\n\nAs for the new release today, i'm trying the updateGHFile. Sadly i'm getting plenty of warnings like this one:\n\n1. Failed to parse version and date from \"Ladybug_Ladybug\" component.\n\nAnd similar like this for all LB components in the canvas.\n\nHave to say that it used to work a while ago. Then it didn't so i kept using the previous updater.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 30, 2017 at 10:40PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "updateGHFile not working", "id": "topic_1790986"}
