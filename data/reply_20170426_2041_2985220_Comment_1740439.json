{"body": "\nThank you, Abraham.\n\n\n\nMy main concerns are:\n\n1. the intersectMass component shouldn't give a warning for breps with no **partially overlapping** surfaces\n\n2. the warning is not given in a consistent manner.\n\n\n\nWe can bypass the intersectMass component in this particular case, but we still need to use it in other workflow in which large amount of input breps may or may not have partially overlapping surfaces. It will not be efficient if we have to manually bypass intersecMass for particular cases it cannot handle.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "April 26, 2017 at 08:41PM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1740151", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1740439"}
