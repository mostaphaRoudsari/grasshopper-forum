{"body": "\nHi Claudia,\n\n\n\nI'm not sure, because I can't check well your workflow. But, as you said, this could be related to:<br/>1) mesh construction by points<br/>2) how you set the function inside evaluate GH component<br/>It seems an issue of order the list.\n\n\n\nAnyhow, you can test this small example that I prepared for you. it requires a MeshEdit component, you can find it on Food4Rhino.\n\nI suggest that you use analysis mesh output instead of points.\n\n\n\nLet me know if it works.\n\n- Antonello\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1691909", "name": "LB_recolorMesh_treshold.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "February 15, 2017 at 7:41am", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1692063", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1691908"}
