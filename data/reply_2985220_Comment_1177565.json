{"body": "\nAlejandro,\n\nI believe that I may have just looked at your file in which you set a lot of surfaces to adiabatic and sorry for not doing so sooner.\n\nUnderstanding the difference between isothermal (no temperature change) and adiabatic (no heat flow) was one of the hardest things for me to understand when I was just starting out with thermodynamics. \u00a0Adiabatic does not mean that the interior surfaces of the zone are at the same temperature as that of the air. \u00a0It just means that any heat that becomes stored in that interior surface and the thermal mass of its construction can only exit by going back into the zone which it is a part of (either into the air or radiating to the other surfaces of the zone).\n\nIn an E+ simulation where you do not set the interior surfaces to adiabatic, heat can conduct all of the way through a floor or an interior wall to the zone on the other side. \u00a0In simulations with adiabatic surfaces, heat tends to get trapped within the single zones and this can give you cooling loads that are much higher than they should be in reality. \u00a0In adiabatic simulations, I am used to seeing surface temperatures that are much higher than the zone air but, in winter, I imagine that you could get the case that you are describing. \u00a0Generally, after I experimented with adiabatic cases a lot, I have decided that I should try to avoid them if I can since they can give results that are pretty far from the real case unless you set up the simulation and the problem that you are trying to solve just right.\n\n\n\nIt sounds like you are referring to the different types of boundary conditions in your question about\u00a0the difference between a \"adiabatic adjacency\" and a \"surface adjacency.\" \u00a0\"Adiabatic\" means no heat flow, as above, and \"surface\" just means that it is a normal E+ surface where heat can conduct all of the way through the wall or floor into the adjacent zone.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 29, 2014 at 5:35am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1176086", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1177565"}
