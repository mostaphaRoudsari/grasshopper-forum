{"body": "\nRefractive index of a material indicates how light would behave when it passes through that material. Since Radiance is a physically based renderer, it's pretty to see this phenomenon in action.\n\nThe image on the upper right shows a table made of a material with refractive index of 1.5 (typical for glass) while the one below it shows a table made out of air (air has a refractive index of 1). The other two are wood and aluminum.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2RR8Hh9pEHgrOLT8rPOTaFVcIXRNb7M2M45OQCClat8Rr2JJBbS3tR-juYiEg0UI8VVLMMbtXSxYe3h8aKjzUG1IlzUuph2J/1014201522717PM.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2RR8Hh9pEHgrOLT8rPOTaFVcIXRNb7M2M45OQCClat8Rr2JJBbS3tR-juYiEg0UI8VVLMMbtXSxYe3h8aKjzUG1IlzUuph2J/1014201522717PM.jpg)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "October 14, 2015 at 12:30PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1377871", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1378778"}
