{"body": "\nJulia,\n\n\n\nI got the chance to look more deeply at your file and I realized what was going on: it seems that you are building a custom HVAC system and you have added custom names for things like the \"DOAS Supply Fan.\" \u00a0This was causing the functions in the result reader component that try to match outputs to zones to get a bit confused. \u00a0I also understand now why you were not able to upload a GH definition as it seems your getting into some deeper editing with either the OpenStudio interface or the IDF editor.\n\n\n\nIn any case, I have added in an extra function into the result reader component that will catch any custom names for fans, pumps, heating equipment, or cooling equipment and make sure that they all come in. \u00a0Everything seems to be coming in fine for your file:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/pn1gkRGKtSZr2XHZBXQKNP4v8l-YcBgHl2V4wYfeBfVDI-j-VaIT4v9e6VaZ8Zw9Q2wTSh5ugWmCos3R2KKcCmvi*Pw9cjQ*/ImprovedResultImporter.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/pn1gkRGKtSZr2XHZBXQKNP4v8l-YcBgHl2V4wYfeBfVDI-j-VaIT4v9e6VaZ8Zw9Q2wTSh5ugWmCos3R2KKcCmvi*Pw9cjQ*/ImprovedResultImporter.JPG)\n\n\n\nYou can find the updated component attached and you can get it in your Honeybee toolbar by syncing with the github.\n\n\n\nThanks for reporting!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1592962", "name": "MoreRobustResultImporter.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 03, 2016 at 12:07PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1591241", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1592961"}
