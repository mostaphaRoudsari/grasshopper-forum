{"body": "\nMostapha, thanks for the tips! Here is an update : [https://youtu.be/xYvc25KT1Nw](https://youtu.be/xYvc25KT1Nw)\n\nI am attaching the ghuser file and python code. Please feel free to edit/correct/share it in whichever way. You'd have to change the ghenv values, other than that, I think it is fairly stable. The icon isn't royalty-free (got it from google image search), so you might have to change that too. I have tried to make the coding-style Honeybee-esque, although there are likely to be some redundancies in it. I am somewhat confused by the Github lingo and rules, so I will leave that to you. The idea for the component wasn't mine to begin with anyway..\n\n\n\n(Let me know how the Photometry thing works out.. I haven't played with it myself in a month or so)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1388668", "name": "Add_window_thickness.ghuser"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1388669", "name": "window_thickness.py"}], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "October 28, 2015 at 08:51PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1373939", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1388667"}
