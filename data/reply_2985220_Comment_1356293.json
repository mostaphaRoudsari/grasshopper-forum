{"body": "\nHi Mona,\n\nSorry for getting back so late. \u00a0In the future, you will have a better chance of others getting back to you fast here if you can upload a file with just the specific problem that you are having. \u00a0I still can't understand all that you are trying to simulate in this new file but the one thing that I can tell you is that this is not a valid zone that you can plug into an energy simulation:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/YKlX7Itxqum2ofo-n9jI6MritP6QkMU8lhKAnR3Kog3w2QAjTdDuOCVqmupkb9P2zmm4DoxMh21x818jhNnmAxhidgZmT6A7/NotAZone.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/YKlX7Itxqum2ofo-n9jI6MritP6QkMU8lhKAnR3Kog3w2QAjTdDuOCVqmupkb9P2zmm4DoxMh21x818jhNnmAxhidgZmT6A7/NotAZone.JPG)\n\nZones are closed breps/polysurfaces that represent volumes of well-mixed air (like a room). \u00a0It might be worthwhile for you to go through the EnergyPlus tutorial videos that I put up:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8Y...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_)\n\n\n\nI know that just 2 days of a workshop is a very short time to go over all of EnergyPlus. \u00a0With these videos, you can pause and re-watch stuff so that you can learn it over longer periods of time.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 7, 2015 at 10:46am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1348442", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1356293"}
