{"body": "\nFurion,\n\nIt also just occurred to me that by \"crashing\" you might mean that Grasshopper freezes and that by \"connecting up wind speed\" you mean connecting wind speed from the weather file. \u00a0If this is the case, the component is not crashing but is just calculating 8760 comfort polygons for the 8760 wind speeds in the stream of data. \u00a0This can take over an hour to calculate and so it is recommended that you use something like average monthly wind speeds if you want to use this feature of the psych chart (or just plug in 1 or 2 wind speeds). \u00a0Let me know if this interpretation is correct and, otherwise, upload a file that demonstrates the crashing you are talking about.\n\nI attached a file showing you how to use average monthly wind speeds if this is indeed the issue:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/HnQKU2LSbWifo9y7Kq7U2OR9Gr0IIIFwpBpB8aKyLbpbLggeZ5ccQSMHm*JNotk*FCDMxv7Wl2SgESvu0HxZhfhTIDoe-9Fl/AverageMonthlyWindSpeed.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/HnQKU2LSbWifo9y7Kq7U2OR9Gr0IIIFwpBpB8aKyLbpbLggeZ5ccQSMHm*JNotk*FCDMxv7Wl2SgESvu0HxZhfhTIDoe-9Fl/AverageMonthlyWindSpeed.JPG)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/HnQKU2LSbWiii3F8-OSsYXlcj7eN9lVkX3qmNqWM*QNYCbu9rtSO*OvD5*vLr2BAi99d3KyRlYhGbBZWVh64xm5vLK*P-dtM/AverageMonthlyWindSpeed2.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/HnQKU2LSbWiii3F8-OSsYXlcj7eN9lVkX3qmNqWM*QNYCbu9rtSO*OvD5*vLr2BAi99d3KyRlYhGbBZWVh64xm5vLK*P-dtM/AverageMonthlyWindSpeed2.JPG)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1416800", "name": "AverageMonthly Wind Speed.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 7, 2015 at 8:31pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416795", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416799"}
