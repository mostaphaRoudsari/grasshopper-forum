{"body": "\nHi all!\n\nI am curious about how you guys create and/or edit your geometries for your analysis?\n\nI am not really familiar with the workflows in Rhino (yet) to create Breps for a building model. Is there a simple method to import floor plans (i.e. dxf files) and create 3-dimensional models from that?\n\nI personally like the simplicity of putting the geometry together Sketchup but the OpenStudio Plugin has its flaws when it comes to editing Spaces/Zones. Using Honeybee to create the zones from a model seems to work better, so what I am doing right now is:\n\n-importing a floor plan on Sketchup\n\n-trace the walls and extrude the faces\n\n-group the faces per zone\n\n-import in Rhino\n\n-set as Brep in Grasshopper\n\nThat seems to be working quite nicely, but not 100%. There are always some faces that are not being recognized correctly in terms of boundary conditions (after intersecting and solving adjacencies). Sometimes redrawing and reimporting that particular zone helps.\n\nBut what I would like to know as a Rhino noob if there are easier ways to get these things going in Rhino/Grasshopper and/or what kinds of limitations there might be with the Sketchup import.\n\nThanks in advance!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Albert Pressler", "created_at": "December 4, 2014 at 1:20pm", "created_by": "AlbertPressler", "topic": "Creating and editing Geometry", "id": "topic_1181151"}
