{"body": "Solon,\nThat part of the script is calculating the average window temperature on the window side of the plane, the average opaque temperature on that side of the plane, and is multiplying both by their respective view factors to get the total radiant temperature on that side of the plane. This temperature is compared with the temperature on the other side of the plane to estimate radiant asymmetry discomfort.\nLet me know if this makes sense.\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "January 09, 2017 at 07:01AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1666317", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1668984"}
