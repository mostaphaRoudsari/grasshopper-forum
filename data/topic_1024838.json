{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI am wondering how should I set up this kind of model for daylight analysis. I guess it should be multiple zones joined at the end. I tried to union it in rhino, but the resulting brep could not be used as a zone. Also, I have a vertical wall for light bouncing, I am not sure how to include it into analysis.\n\n\n\nAlso I would like to ask if it is possible to get analysed grid as a curved surface, rather than flat plane.\n\nRegards,\n\nPetar\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1024837", "name": "prob.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Petar Pejic", "created_at": "March 12, 2014 at 9:33am", "created_by": "PetarPejic", "topic": "how to set up this kind of model", "id": "topic_1024838"}
