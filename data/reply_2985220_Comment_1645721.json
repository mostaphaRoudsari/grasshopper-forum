{"body": "\nHello All,\n\n\n\nThank you for asking and sorry for the late reply. \u00a0This limitation is native to E+ and affects the E+ blinds object:\n\n[http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-5/input-output-reference/gr...](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-5/input-output-reference/group-surface-construction-elements.html#windowmaterialblind)\n\n\n\nThe simple E+ parameterization of the blinds is just not accurate when the shadeDepth, distToGlass, or distBetween is greater than 1 meter. \u00a0For these cases, you should plug the generated shadeGeometry into a \"Honeybee_Context\" component in order to factor it into the simulation. \u00a0As a general rule of thumb, any geometry that is larger than 1 meter should probably be simulated using the \"Honeybee_Context\" component for now.\n\n\n\nIn the future, I had planned to possibly assingn E+[Overhang](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-5/input-output-reference/group-thermal-zone-description-geometry.html#shadingoverhang) or [Fin](http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-5/input-output-reference/group-thermal-zone-description-geometry.html#shadingfin)\u00a0objects to the windows, which can be larger than 1 meter and thus could be ouput from the HBObjWShades for some cases. \u00a0For the time being, the Honeybee_Context is the best way to deal with this case, though.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 24, 2016 at 6:01pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1637385", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1645721"}
