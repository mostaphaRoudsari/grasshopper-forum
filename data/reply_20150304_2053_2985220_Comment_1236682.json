{"body": "Hi Alejandro-\n\nThanks for taking an early stab at this. It looks like you have an old version of either the Air Handler component. For some reason, line 412 in the openstudio component thinks that the HVACDetails of the zone should have a dictionary with key \"availabilityManagerList\", but the HVACDetails that you passed to it, does not have that key in its dictionary.\n\nI write this just in case you are interested in knowing more about the inner workings of the components. All the components pass information to one another as a dictionary of sorts, so the fact that the OpenStudio component can't find the key, means that the upstream component did not pass a dictionary with the key.\n\nOn my computer, everything is of course working great. I possibly did not update this component in honeybee and so it may have been my fault. I have updated the component on Github, with today's date (March 04, 2015).\n\nIt should be working just fine, if you update. If you are still having problems, I can send you an example file that is exactly the same as the one you've used in your example.", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chien Si Harriman", "created_at": "March 04, 2015 at 08:53PM", "created_by": "ChienSiHarriman", "parent_id": "topic_1233925", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1236682"}
