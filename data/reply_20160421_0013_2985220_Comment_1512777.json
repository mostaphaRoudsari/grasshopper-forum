{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks for your reply. I've checked your list: after re-installed Dragonfly, I run\u00a0MyAppInstaller_web.exe (it installed UWGengine v2.2 + MCR v9).\n\n\n\nFrom your link (it seems to be the same of readMe! message of DF, before to install UWGengine + MCR v9) i noticed that MCR version is 2.11, so i've unistalled my previous version (UWG v2.2) then installed that one from your link.\n\nSo I saw that from your point 3) in my ladybug directory there isn't UWG folder, so i copied from\u00a0[https://github.com/hansukyang/UWG_Matlab/commit/f9e7ecb46a1a294dfcf...](https://github.com/hansukyang/UWG_Matlab/commit/f9e7ecb46a1a294dfcfe090f0d084dc674a8f301) UWG.zip and I moved UWG folder to c:\\ladybug.\n\n\n\nMaybe i forget something, so attached my def (that's original one) i suppose that issue is in my machine (programs).\n\n\n\nP.S.: I have the same issue even without specify a new EPW (morphed) path, so I've deleted that one in my attached def.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Luciano", "created_at": "April 21, 2016 at 12:13AM", "created_by": "Ambrosinus", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1512731", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1512777"}
