{"body": "\n\u00a0Hi Mostapha and LBHB folks,\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen working with complex geometries, such as towers with a context, (Daylight Analysis) I noticed that **Oconv** crashes often.One solution I am using is outputting geometries as clusters and then recombine all in the final .rad simulation.\n\n\n\nHowever even when doing that, I still get warning from rtrace (non-planar vertex for polygons).\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor simple geometry I am forcing triangulation as input meshes. However for complex meshes it's too much and keep crashing the oconv.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHave you ever had such problems? Are you forcing triangulation by default with current HBSurf component?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance and fantastic tool...every update gets better and better.\n\n-berardo\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Berardo Matalucci", "created_at": "April 28, 2015 at 1:04pm", "created_by": "BerardoMatalucci", "topic": "DAYLIGHT / Non-Planar Vertex / RTrace and Oconv issues with complex geometry", "id": "topic_1275288"}
