{"body": "\nHi Tim\n\n\n\nFirstly, I have to change its name! sorry.\n\nI have to modify it, I want to make it faster than now. And I need to write some parts differently.\n\nAnyway, it can calculate **sunrise/sunset** time of HOYs without passing through sun path component (to increase the speed of calculation), and other important properties of the sun, especially if you want to consider minutes, seconds.. (e.g. 13:58:05).\n\n\n\nIn fact, I should add sun vector output and, maybe, other specific functions linked to daylight schedules.\n\nBut it is work in progress. ;)\n\n<br/>Best<br/>Antonello\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antonello Di Nunzio", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 07:58AM", "created_by": "AntonelloDiNunzio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462735", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462697"}
