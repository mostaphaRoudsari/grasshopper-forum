{"body": "\nHi Maria,<br/><br/>This is a bug with tolerances. The component would work properly if one would angle the vertical surface just tiny little bit (0.1 degrees for example).\n\n<br/>Attached below is the fixed version of Sunpath shading component.\n\nThe \"unofficial\" label below it, is just a reminder that this component is still not publicly released through Ladybug github repository.<br/><br/>Thank you for reporting the bug!! This plugin and its components would definitively not be what it is without the support of the users like you!!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1610877", "name": "161003LadybugVerticalPV2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "October 04, 2016 at 03:42PM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1610085", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1610876"}
