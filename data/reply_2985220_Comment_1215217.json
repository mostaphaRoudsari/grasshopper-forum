{"body": "\nHi Alfonso,\n\nIt is possible for you to have diffuse radiation coming from the sky after the sun has set and before the sun has risen. \u00a0This is why the list of radiation values larger than 0 is longer than the list of sun vectors or sun-up hours.\n\nIf you need a list of radiation values that aligns with the list of sun vectors, plug the radiation form the \"ImporEPW\" component into the \"annualHourlyData\" input of the sunpath. \u00a0A list of radation values aligned to the list of sunVectors will come out of the selHourlyData output. \u00a0You can use this to make your visualization\n\nThere are a few ways to understand radiation on a non-horizontal surface. \u00a0You can do a radiation study, use the radiation rose, or use the cala Lily. \u00a0All have tutorials here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkjfDmSc5OrzBgdPWQB7rbqFycWp...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkjfDmSc5OrzBgdPWQB7rbqFycWpbxtaN)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 1, 2015 at 6:32am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1214972", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1215217"}
