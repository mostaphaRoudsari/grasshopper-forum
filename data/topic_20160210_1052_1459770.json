{"body": "\nDear bee and bugs,\n\n\n\nI'd like to share and discuss with you my understanding of Sky View Factor, considering that it is an import concept frequently misunderstood.\n\n\n\nSky View Factor is first and foremost defined from the discussion of **radiation exchange between urban surfaces and the sky** in urban heat island research (See Oke's literature list below). It will be affected by the proportion of sky visible from a given calculation point on a surface (vertical or horizontal) as a result of the obstruction of urban geometry, but it is not entirely associated with the solid angle subtended by the visible sky patch/patches.\n\n\n\nSo, I think using \"geometry way\" to approximate Sky View Factor is not correct. Sky View Factor calculation shall be based on the first principle defining the concept: radiation exchange between urban surface and sky hemisphere:\n\n\n\n(image extracted from Johnson, G. T., &amp; Watson, 1984)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/oQBa5IX*T7Zexu8izHmsNEXlEXyJAhnACLt8Peig6xjohuWSS1jQGsWBuZiV-a-l9F61N*Atwn9Xun1MySi3hO5zzZRd-WKH/6.PNG\" width=\"706\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/oQBa5IX*T7Zexu8izHmsNEXlEXyJAhnACLt8Peig6xjohuWSS1jQGsWBuZiV-a-l9F61N*Atwn9Xun1MySi3hO5zzZRd-WKH/6.PNG)\n\n\n\nTherefore, I always refer to the following \"theoretical\" Sky View Factors calculated at the centre of an infinitely long street canyon with different Height-to-width ratios in Oke's original paper (1981) as the **ultimate benchmark** to validate different methods to calculate SVF:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/oQBa5IX*T7avOBk3QZwO6YuLEcJgbmH4X4TadCDRQGW8qonx*GbT5oi2Yy-pHXBApuVxSp*Dp9Z6MacqH-WnYrQMgTfgon0Z/00.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/oQBa5IX*T7avOBk3QZwO6YuLEcJgbmH4X4TadCDRQGW8qonx*GbT5oi2Yy-pHXBApuVxSp*Dp9Z6MacqH-WnYrQMgTfgon0Z/00.PNG)\n\n\n\nSo, I agree with Compagnon (2004) on the method he used to calculate SVF: a simple radiation (or illuminance) simulation using a uniform sky.\n\n\n\nThe following images are the results of the workflow I built in the procedural modeling software Houdini (using its python library) according to this principle by calling Radiance to do the simulation and calculation, and the SVF values calculated for different canyon H/W ratios (shown at the bottom of each image) are very close to the values shown in Oke's paper.\n\n\n\nH/W=0.25, SVF=0.895\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/oQBa5IX*T7YrH5DRBE*vkCCT90Ueygxiy5tdpuz1hS2rVsJsWd--oGVoNbB2dcD5SLQi3B7QcFSL7FCURJuuTe8CYtwwHZeJ/0.25.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/oQBa5IX*T7YrH5DRBE*vkCCT90Ueygxiy5tdpuz1hS2rVsJsWd--oGVoNbB2dcD5SLQi3B7QcFSL7FCURJuuTe8CYtwwHZeJ/0.25.PNG)\n\nH/W=1, SVF=0.447\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/oQBa5IX*T7YpqzJRRNQzOwWg5GcUngydf8Z7J3U2CQWCHrkLmhrnaSIwdcfzfkm8tPnkxlTvy5u9ztlDbnX0Ey8YeydNZ5ax/1.0.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/oQBa5IX*T7YpqzJRRNQzOwWg5GcUngydf8Z7J3U2CQWCHrkLmhrnaSIwdcfzfkm8tPnkxlTvy5u9ztlDbnX0Ey8YeydNZ5ax/1.0.PNG)\n\nH/W=2, SVF=0.246\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/oQBa5IX*T7Zc40eIiuJb-SRGzYgnAz*NLnkxPzQlV5q3jpVxPIog3kc4wFzF*-pZBla*fqebMJlDQAsmhsDgEn7m08iu0AyD/2.0.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/oQBa5IX*T7Zc40eIiuJb-SRGzYgnAz*NLnkxPzQlV5q3jpVxPIog3kc4wFzF*-pZBla*fqebMJlDQAsmhsDgEn7m08iu0AyD/2.0.PNG)\n\n\n\nIt seems that the Sky View Factor calculated from the viewAnalysis component in Ladybug is not aligned with Oke's result for a given H/W ration: (GH file attached)\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/oQBa5IX*T7apfIrGCqI7idjyYInh*-engV9Lmxdoy5brq6x21AqFJfSl2MjKeq0YGGgEwH3f6q*kAZRF*iMKbRftnPK0D14J/5.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/oQBa5IX*T7apfIrGCqI7idjyYInh*-engV9Lmxdoy5brq6x21AqFJfSl2MjKeq0YGGgEwH3f6q*kAZRF*iMKbRftnPK0D14J/5.PNG)\n\nAccording to the definition shown in this component, I assume the value calculated is the percentage of visible sky which is a geometric calculation (shooting evenly distributed rays from sensor point to the sky and calculate the ratio of rays not blocked by urban geometry?), i.e solid angle subtended by visible sky patches, and it is not aligned with the original radiation exchange definition of Sky View Factor.\n\n\n\nI'd suggest to call this geometrically calculated ratio of visible sky \"**Sky Exposure Factor**\" which is \"true\" to its definition and way of calculation (see the paper on Sky Exposure Factor below) so as to avoid confusion with \"The Sky View Factor based on radiation exchange\" as discussed in urban climate literature.\n\n\n\nAppreciate your comments and advice!\n\n\n\n**References:**\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1459769", "name": "SVF_test_v001.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "February 10, 2016 at 10:52AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "[discussion] Sky View Factor", "id": "topic_1459770"}
