{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\nno we [haven't](https://github.com/mcneel/ghpython/blob/master/Component/ScriptingAncestorComponent.cs#L821). It's there [since 4 months](https://github.com/mcneel/ghpython/commit/38cf73f921a436c0f27fd870ea7ab0d706d202e9#diff-6170819c68eff86724d798cf313b4a76R669)\u00a0(but not forever, and we are not planning to remove it any time soon). In general, it is automatically assigned if you set the Help (or Remarks) keyword [in the docstring help](https://github.com/mcneel/ghpython/blob/master/Component/DocStringUtils.cs#L23)\u00a0in the component.\n\n@Saeran:\u00a0What version of GhPython are you using? I think it is an older version.<br/><br/>@Mostapha: Why are you assigning \"2\" to\u00a0AdditionalHelpFromDocStrings? This property is just a way to easily show a small remark at the end of the help file. But it would be better to just use the docstring help key for it. It's not a mistake to set it, though.\n\nThanks,\n\nGiulio\n\n--\n\nGiulio Piacentino<br/>for Robert McNeel &amp; Associates<br/>giulio@mcneel.com\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Piacentino", "created_at": "February 4, 2014 at 8:54am", "created_by": "GiulioPiacentino", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1002687", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1002693"}
