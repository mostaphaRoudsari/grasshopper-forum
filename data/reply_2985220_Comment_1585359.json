{"body": "\nSee file attached -- let me know if there's anything to be done.\n\n\n\nOn that note, does the Export to OpenStudio component do anything different from\u00a0 launching OpenStudio and doing File/Import/IDF file? (I know that just importing an IDF into OpenStudio doesn't import everything from the IDF file.) If you connect an HVAC system, does this export automatically create the system in the IDF or do you still have to do it in OS after?
