{"body": "\nHello\n\n\n\nI have a similar case to Tasos, and I want to know what is the best way to model Air Wall for daylighting simulation. Is the best way to assign a glass with 100% transmittance to those special walls?\n\nWhat is the most efficient way to select those air walls (which do not exist and I used them to separate thermal zones) in a model with multiple zones? I have just created one floor and my goal is to create 6 floors finally.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your help\n\nLadan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1644430", "name": "CCC_Honeybee_Gridbased_22_11_16.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 22, 2016 at 1:10pm", "created_by": "LillyGD", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1243631", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1644428"}
