{"body": "\nI am not exactly sure what Relux is doing with Radiance. I think it is running Radiance within a process from C++ and lot of the functionality is actually hidden from the users. You can find the cal files and rad files in this folder :\n\nC:\\Users\\Sarith\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\radSources\u00a0 (replace my name with yours).\n\nHowever, the pic file which is created in that folder crashes. So, I tried to hack the process and get an image through a screenshot and ra_bmp.\n\n\n\nThis is the rendering that I got through Relux:\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7C2qIN6WACk9-qpoebRb5mwepcHUL-Wm4MHvqmzXYxr538eQy6Hxv5h5mJPO6Vg6fr-HpI-jCJgnhh7Eysl0FWS7C1c*Ai9Q/219201631145PM.bmp?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/7C2qIN6WACk9-qpoebRb5mwepcHUL-Wm4MHvqmzXYxr538eQy6Hxv5h5mJPO6Vg6fr-HpI-jCJgnhh7Eysl0FWS7C1c*Ai9Q/219201631145PM.bmp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what I got from my own renderings with image that I got:\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7C2qIN6WACmXRqplsFFU2zp9d*t5acoRL*9G5K5YEW8SiV5gJ3gpqjq4dmj5POzJUXlnUFUCJShLiDGka4FEN8R2jwarrL1v/219201631357PM.bmp?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/7C2qIN6WACmXRqplsFFU2zp9d*t5acoRL*9G5K5YEW8SiV5gJ3gpqjq4dmj5POzJUXlnUFUCJShLiDGka4FEN8R2jwarrL1v/219201631357PM.bmp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7C2qIN6WACkcVhoHTh4xpD-6Lz5FRM1bJ4O9pMi*RrA0XKA0Zv3PKg4MsG5bezW5p1wtLnatQ-x3sQ8yo0dZYVQY4kevaJsw/219201631620PM.bmp?width=500\" width=\"500\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/7C2qIN6WACkcVhoHTh4xpD-6Lz5FRM1bJ4O9pMi*RrA0XKA0Zv3PKg4MsG5bezW5p1wtLnatQ-x3sQ8yo0dZYVQY4kevaJsw/219201631620PM.bmp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is surprising because the material is called Glass. However the radiance definition of the material is :\n\nvoid **colorpict** mat_104~1<br/>9 red green blue surfpic2.pic alignpic.cal tile_u tile_v -s 0.58500<br/>0<br/>1 0.975<br/><br/>mat_104~1 **plastic** mat_104<br/>0<br/>0<br/>5 1 1 1 0 0<br/><br/>\n\nThe colorpict on the the first line only modifies color patterns and does not make the material transparent/translucent. Similarly, the plastic type implies that the material won't be transparent anyway.\n\n\n\nI don't think this material as defined in Relux is a physically based material. You are probably better off importing the Raytracer materials to Honeybee. Andy Mcneil had an excellent presentation about GlassBlocks in the last Radiance workshop: [http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2015-philadelphi...](http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2015-philadelphia/presentations/day2/McNeil_glassblock.pdf)\n\n\n\nThe pic file that I generated is here : [https://www.dropbox.com/s/5c32layqehdns72/surfpic2.pic?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5c32layqehdns72/surfpic2.pic?dl=0)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "February 19, 2016 at 1:25pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1466975", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1466979"}
