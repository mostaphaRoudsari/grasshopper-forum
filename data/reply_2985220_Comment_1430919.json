{"body": "\nI just had this issue I think Chris. I actually had to reconstruct the zones after baking the create glz based on ratio component. While this was quite fast due to being a daylighting study and a small model, it is still kind of an insane thing to do (my mind was too tired from the E+ reference guide to find a solution).\n\n\n\nIf I understand correctly, the problem is not really the EP constructions, as those can be easily added through the workflow you are showing. But, at least to my limitedd knowledge, there is no Radiance input available after the glazing component has done its work. I'm guessing an input, like the one in the Create HB Surfaces component, is what Tassos wants in the 'based on glz' component?\n\n\n\n(all the above is obviously moot in the case that the attached workflow also takes care zone setup for daylighting studies as well).\n\n\n\nKind regards,<br/>Theodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 4, 2016 at 11:36pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1430438", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1430919"}
