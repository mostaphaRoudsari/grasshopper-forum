{"body": "\nHi Albert,\n\n\n\nThanks for testing Butterfly. It is indeed quite possible, and actually very efficient, to set up the case in Butterfly and run it in Linux. OF running in Linux is, at this moment, at least 50% faster than Windows. Of course that is to be expected with a Docker installation.\n\n\n\nEssentially, what BF will do is to help you run through the case preparation phase which is usually very time consuming. You can also use the write option in the run component to save the case and its files before you go to Linux.\n\n\n\nHope this helps! Please don't hesitate to add these issues in GitHub as well, or any other issue you might find.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 25, 2017 at 01:42AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1719706", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1720295"}
