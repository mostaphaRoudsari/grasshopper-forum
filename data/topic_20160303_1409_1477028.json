{"body": "\nHello All,\n\n\n\nI am working on designing a high rise \u00a0that uses \u00a0a kinetic facade. The facade shifts according to the location of the sun. For example, the facade module opens and closes depending on where the sun is. I want to use Ladybug and Honeybee for the location of the sun but do not know how to inform the geometry to open and close based on where the sun is. Does anybody have any suggestions where I can start? \u00a0Or maybe a tutorial ? I tried doing a few tutorials found on the forum to understand how the plug ins work but I think I am missing something. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "March 03, 2016 at 02:09PM", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "topic": "Kinetic Facade", "id": "topic_1477028"}
