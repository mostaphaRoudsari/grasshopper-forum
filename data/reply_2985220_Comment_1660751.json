{"body": "\nRicardo,\n\nLooking at your energy balance, it seems that your model has such a high intensity of people heat sources that it never actually gets the chance to need active heating:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ycvwLIslca48U-RXPCqUYiJRY7NnbL4jGy1WUfmi2fogY-thSPJePBK1mCl1diYVFL3Em*Of**us*HNhaC57f57HE1-GW43G/HotBoxEBal.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ycvwLIslca48U-RXPCqUYiJRY7NnbL4jGy1WUfmi2fogY-thSPJePBK1mCl1diYVFL3Em*Of**us*HNhaC57f57HE1-GW43G/HotBoxEBal.JPG)\n\nNow that we have fixed the issue with the Heating Design Day setpoint, this high intensity of people heat is the reason why you don't have any heating load. \u00a0Perhaps your case of a very small, largely adiabatic test box with so many people in it is not too realistic. \u00a0Or perhaps it is and I don't know your project well. \u00a0All I can say is that there is nothing wrong with how the energy model is running. \u00a0It's just doing what you tell it to do here.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1660752", "name": "Thermalloads_FORUM2bis_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 20, 2016 at 6:36pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1659939", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1660751"}
