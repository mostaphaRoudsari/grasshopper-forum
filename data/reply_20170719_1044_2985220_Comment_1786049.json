{"body": "\nHi Ehsan,\n\nGenerally speaking, as a first step an outdoor flow analysis is performed. This analysis establishes pressure and velocity at air inlets. As a second step, these pressure and or velocity are taken as boundary conditions to run a separate indoor analysis. I believe both types of analysis are possible with the Butterfly plugin.\n\nThanks,\n\nDevang\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devang Chauhan", "created_at": "July 19, 2017 at 10:44AM", "created_by": "devang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1785709", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1786049"}
