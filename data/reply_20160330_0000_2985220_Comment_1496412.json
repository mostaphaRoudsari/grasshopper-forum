{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI can see that there is a change between the hydra version and the updated version of the HB_EPWindowShades components. Specially with the last input items (data1, 2, 3), which in the new there is only data1.\n\nI've tried adding the inputs in the component but the file works endlessly, so i assume some clarifications regarding those inputs will be welcomed.\n\nAlso in the HB_EnergyShadeBenefit\u00a0 inputs it is not clear now (for me) how the output of the Shads must be connected regarding the heating/cooling loads and beam gain inputs.\n\n\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 30, 2016 at 12:00AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1495777", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1496412"}
