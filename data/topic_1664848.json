{"body": "\nHello all,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to simulate an evaporative cooling tower in Energyplus. The base case analysis\u00a0is running fine and I'm\u00a0able to results. I'm hoping to integrate a passive downdraft\u00a0evaporative cooling system in my\u00a0test zone. I wish to\u00a0see the potential decrease in kWh/m2 upon integrating this system.\n\nUnfortunately,\u00a0I'm\u00a0facing some problems. I'm\u00a0getting two error messages in the RunEnergySimulation component.\n\n\n\n1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error:<br/>** Severe ** ZoneCoolTower:Shower=\"EVAPTOWER\" invalid Zone Name: \"COOLZONE\" not found.\n\n1. The simulation has failed because of this fatal error.\n\n** Fatal ** ZoneCoolTower:Shower errors occurred in input. Program terminates.\n\n\n\nI've tried various PDEC integration methods with my geometry. What is the proper way to place or design a tower with my geometry?\n\n\n\nI'm attaching the Rhino file along with the GH file.\n\nI'm Also attaching the definition available in Hydra for reference.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks! looking forward\u00a0to your reply.\n\n\n\nMajed\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1664845", "name": "PDEC_SIMULATION.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1664846", "name": "Energy modeling+EP Construction+PDEC.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1664847", "name": "Hydra_Evaporative_Cooling_Tower.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Majed B", "created_at": "December 31, 2016 at 1:24pm", "created_by": "MajedB", "topic": "Evaporative cooling tower simulation", "id": "topic_1664848"}
