But step by step I hope to get better as soon as possible.\n\nAnyway, regarding the file i have attached, it was for a daylight and energy analysis.\n\nI have just exploded your file in order to give to each surface the right characteristics (as RADmaterial, type, construction and so on)..and yes i have now a closed zone, so thanks..\n\nBUT why have I now a &lt;null&gt; zone from the \"createHBZones\" component? indeed i cannot see it in Rhino when\u00a0I ask for the preview :(\n\nCan you help me again??\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 14, 2016 at 09:53AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1547474", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1547669"}
