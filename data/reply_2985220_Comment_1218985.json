{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\nI figured out why your simple geometry is not working. \u00a0I noticed that, if I dropped the perimeter depth down to 1, it works and I also realized that the parts of your building jutting out in plan are about 1 meter. \u00a0So setting the perimeter depth to a large number like 8 meters causes the offset zones to intersect themselves at these corners where the building just out. \u00a0The script does not know how to deal with this case so it just returns the building split by floor. \u00a0So, in short, the component is really only good for cases where there is not a lot of crenelation in the wall.\n\nThe comfort map components are ready for beta testing. \u00a0You can find an updated example file here:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/rpty2ff9992ko5n/Indoor%20Temperature%20Ma...](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rpty2ff9992ko5n/Indoor%20Temperature%20Map19.gh?dl=0)\n\nI encourage you to split up your building into many zones and put air walls between them. \u00a0If you can, you should also split your surfaces. \u00a0This will ensure a higher resolution and a more accurate understanding of the interior micro-climates.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/hMNECPNor98BtT7i2aYss3vc04c1yEZEUPMlV29qHxBuc*RRJSHSmB0I2hZxtgkvQvxFuD95P7ZAzxWVH1huS6Xe9EJMSM*v/IndoorMicroclimateMap.PNG\" width=\"712\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/hMNECPNor98BtT7i2aYss3vc04c1yEZEUPMlV29qHxBuc*RRJSHSmB0I2hZxtgkvQvxFuD95P7ZAzxWVH1huS6Xe9EJMSM*v/IndoorMicroclimateMap.PNG)\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 5, 2015 at 5:20pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1217925", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1218985"}
