{"body": "\nHi nass,\n\nThank you for reporting this. This is more of a limitation than a bug. Update component just updates the code and doesn't really check for changes in inputs and outputs. As I mentioned above when I originally developed the component I was thinking that it will be only used by developers and they will take care of limitations like this. Now that it is getting used by everyone maybe I should modify the code to take care of these changes.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "April 22, 2015 at 4:13pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1269918", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1270725"}
