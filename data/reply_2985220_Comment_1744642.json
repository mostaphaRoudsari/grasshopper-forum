{"body": "\nHi Erik,\n\nEverything looks correct with the natural ventilation component so I would assume that the issue is happening for other reasons. \u00a03 degrees between your heating and your nat vent set points should be sufficient to avoid simultaneous heating and ventilation in most cases that I have run but perhaps there's something special about your case.\n\nI can't understand why the temperature is suddenly rising in the afternoon. \u00a0Is this a west-facing facade and is the sun suddenly streaming in?\n\nIf you can upload a gh file with the minimum needed to show the issue, I can take a look.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 2, 2017 at 5:51pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1744330", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1744642"}
