{"body": "\nMostapha,\n\nApologies for the many questions and issues that I'm running into, your quick response and patience with my problems is much appreciated. Attached first is the gh and 3dm file associated with my initial screenshot (just simply trying to create a zone from surfaces). The next gh and 3dm file are of the more irregular geometries that I'm trying to make into zones to run thermal analysis on.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nAaron\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1128541", "name": "zone.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1128542", "name": "zone.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1128543", "name": "ExampleAnalysis_Honeybee2.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Aaron Loomans", "created_at": "September 8, 2014 at 3:29pm", "created_by": "AaronLoomans", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1128475", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1128540"}
