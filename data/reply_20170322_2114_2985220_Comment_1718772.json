{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks a lot. Apologies for my delayed response.\u00a0\n\nBefore your reply I managed to get the script working to get MRT and SET* values for a large urban scale model. The MRT I am getting are quite high (~65\u00b0 from my script).<br/><br/>I actually wanted to reply back with results by running a test case on your script and the one I created to check if there are any fluctuations. Hopefully over the weekend I will get some time and do the test.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am also planning to integrate wind results from BF by taking the same analysis plane for MRT and Wind Analysis. A bit time intensive but should be pretty straight forward. I will share the test case for review hopefully by the weekend.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nSaket\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Saket Sarupria", "created_at": "March 22, 2017 at 09:14PM", "created_by": "SaketSarupria", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1712336", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1718772"}
