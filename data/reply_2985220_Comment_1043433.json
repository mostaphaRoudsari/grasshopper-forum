{"body": "\nThank you for your quick response.\n\nThe problem I have ran into with the version of the Honeybee_falsecolor used in the \"[falseColorLegenPosition.gh](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1043128)\" file you have uploaded is that the new component is obviously different from the original component found in the latest version of Honeybee. Therefore, once I attempt to open the file, the grasshopper sends an error message informing me that there is no replica of the component used in the file as a source userobject. I suppose I'd need the new Honeybee_falsecolor component with the new features with a .ghuser format so that I can copy and replace it within the grasshoppers' UserObject folder. Unless the discrepancy between the new falsecolor component with the added features and the original component installed with the most recent version of the Honeybee should be solved in some other way.\n\nThanks,\n\nAlireza\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alireza", "created_at": "April 13, 2014 at 1:54am", "created_by": "Alireza", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1043149", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1043433"}
