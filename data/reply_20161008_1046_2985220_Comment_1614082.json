{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks. It looks good ... for your example. Unfortunately for mine the differences remain the same as in the original message. I mean, no changes with the updated component (6 October).\n\nI tested the surfaces temperatures for both E+ and OS. there are differences of 1 degree in the minimal and 0.5 in the maximal scale of the legend for the typical weeks (hot and cold). As i said before, comparing both IDF files they are pretty much the same, except for the ScheduleTypeLimits, where the E+ writes 91 objects and the OS only 8-9. Also the OS writes some Schedule:Week:Daily and Schedule:Daily:Interval for Warehouses and they are used for the calculations. Needless to say that i defined for all zones MidriseApartment program.\n\nAdditionally, you are right. I defined almost any possible value, so practically no defaults were left to be used.\n\nLast thing, I understand that both components run EnergyPlus 8.5 installed in the OpenStudio installation directory. I don't have installed 8.5 besides that. Is this right?\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks again,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "October 08, 2016 at 10:46AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1613747", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1614082"}
