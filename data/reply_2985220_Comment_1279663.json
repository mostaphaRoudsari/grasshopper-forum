{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nGot a question (again). After setting up the fan driven ventilation in the component, do I input it in the set ep zone loads component to set up the ventilation rate or is that not required. I know how much the total zone air flow should be but I'm not sure if I should input that in the fan flow rate or in the ventilationperarea of the zone.\n\n\n\nAs a side note, is there an ideal load mechanical ventilation system? Ugh, I know the previous sentence might be terribly wrong but I wonder if there is an easy, EP default, way of setting up MV flow rates in different spaces. If not I guess I will input the minimum rates by ASHRAE.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 3, 2015 at 8:48pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279076", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279663"}
