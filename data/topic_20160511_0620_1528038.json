{"body": "\nI have inherited a bunch of facade dxfs that I want to analyze in therm. these details were made in autocad which looks good but when you zoom way in have not snapped point to point properly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo i get this error:\u00a01. Geometry connected to _polygons does not form a single polysurface when joined and thus will cause THERM to crash.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIs there a good way to algorithmically analyze and clean up these non snapped polygons?\n\nMy head is spinning from zooming in and out trying to chase down these tiny discrepancies.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAny help is appreciated!
