{"body": "\nHi Ding,\n\nGlad that everything's good with the ReadEPResult component. \u00a0I removed totalEnergy since it was not really correct to draw an equivalence between the thermal (heating/cooling) energy and the electric (light and equipment) energy.\n\nTo use you annual daylight result in an E+ simulation, all that you have to do is connect the annualProfiles csv file path to the lighting schedule of the \"Set EnergyPlus Zone Schedules\" component. \u00a0This will assume that you have auto-dimming lights in your zone and so this procedure is correct so long as this is what your final building will have. \u00a0I can't tell what your three methods are in the image but, if you sum up the electric lighting results of the E+ simulation, this will give you a correct indication of your electric lighting energy use. \u00a0You can find more on how to create and assign your own csv schedules in these two videos:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MRK_RxvD3o&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MRK_RxvD3o&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=21)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ZQ5sazwrU&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ZQ5sazwrU&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=22)\n\nAs for the occupancy/lighting situation, usually you are not supposed to have the lights on when occupancy is 0 but I think that daysim is interpreting that particular hour you point out in the excel file as a lunch hour where the occupants would conceivably leave the lights on. \u00a0If you want to be more precise, I think that the \"Daysim Occupancy Generator Based on List\" would give you better results.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 2, 2015 at 1:49pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1277590", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279022"}
