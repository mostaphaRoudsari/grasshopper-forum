{"body": "\nHello Forum,\n\nIf I have a building with a first floor where half the floor plan has double height ceilings... what is the best way to make honeybee zones from this. Should I Boolean union the breps that represent the first floor and double height area? Or is it best to make three zones and have the double height area adjacency with the first floor as an air wall? The double height\u00a0areas are in blue in this attached image. Thanks for your advice. - Ethan\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1494854", "name": "honeybee question.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Ethan", "created_at": "March 29, 2016 at 03:22AM", "created_by": "EthanKerber", "topic": "double height ceilings", "id": "topic_1494855"}
