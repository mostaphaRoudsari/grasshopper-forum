{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI bypassed the components for thermal zone check and connect the zones directly to the energyplus simulation component, and sadly, it doesn't work.\n\n\n\nSo, it seems that the zones generated from the splitBuildingMass component in this case are problematic and unusable for either visualization or simulation ....\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LjtdpeZIE4kJl2q4lnFgL*EdmzYiHTwD45JoWu56Ovs2lpuQpfshKE3v7m3ESnNNL-2hE*tb9Gy23WUYltkgHGEshBGxXquB/Capture.PNG\" width=\"356\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/LjtdpeZIE4kJl2q4lnFgL*EdmzYiHTwD45JoWu56Ovs2lpuQpfshKE3v7m3ESnNNL-2hE*tb9Gy23WUYltkgHGEshBGxXquB/Capture.PNG)\n\nIf I bypass the splitBuildingMass component, then each floor will be an single thermal zone which may lead to inaccurate results.\n\n\n\nDo you have any advise on how to subdivide the zone for each floor into perimeter zones and internal zone without manually creating them.\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1445479", "name": "typology_v011Copy2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "January 23, 2016 at 02:08AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1441831", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1445478"}
