{"body": "\nHi Blanca,\n\n\n\nYou mean you're using Radiance Desktop? That is very outdated and I'm surprised that the analysis is even running as some of the parameters have been removed between now and then.\n\n\n\nThe link is as official as it can get. It is the [official Radiance's github repository](https://github.com/NREL/Radiance)\u00a0under [NREL (National Renewable Energy Lab) github account](https://github.com/NREL). I would go ahead and talk to the IT at your office to update Radiance installation on all the machines including yours.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 2, 2016 at 6:17am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1474954", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1475743"}
