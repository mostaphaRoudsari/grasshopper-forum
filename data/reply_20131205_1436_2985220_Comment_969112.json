{"body": "\nHi Arie,\n\nInteresting question, mainly because it raises issues about the weather file data. I checked yours and my local for comparisson. If you see the detail data you'll notice so big differences in radiation data from one day to the other in the same month. The 21th is equinox but in your case the data for june is not the \"best\" from the \"logic\" point of view. Pick 28 and you'll fill better.\n\nAttached\u00a0 a file with WeatherAnalysis also from Ladybug. I selected one day and some hours for June and September. Play with it and you'll see what i mean. Anyway the radiation differences between both months is not very big.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A969114", "name": "WeatherAnalysis_TMP.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 05, 2013 at 02:36PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_968797", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_969112"}
