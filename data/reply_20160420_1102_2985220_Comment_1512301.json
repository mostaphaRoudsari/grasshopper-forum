{"body": "\nHi Anton\n\n\n\nSorry to piggy back on this. Cool tool btw.\n\n\n\nJust a very basic question I guess - if using your pv tools do I need to provide an epconstruction to account for the pv - thinking in terms of reflectance - or does E+ determine this from the HBGenerator inputs?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Duncan Cox", "created_at": "April 20, 2016 at 11:02AM", "created_by": "DuncanCox", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1439949", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1512301"}
