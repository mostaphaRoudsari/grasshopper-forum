{"body": "\nHee Chris,\n\n\n\nSolution for you might be simple: The distance from the Shading to the glass has to be bigger than 1/2 the size of the shading element. Elsewise the shading element goes through you window and Honeybee does'nt like that.\n\n\n\nI see you have a shading element of 0.05 (0.025 in both direction from centreline shading) and a distance of 0.02 which means the shading element would pas through the window by 0.005. This solved my problems once before.\n\n\n\nMaybe you can have a look at my question?\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/loose-surfa...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/loose-surfaces-in-honeybee-zone)\n\n\n\nGreetings,\n\n\n\nDwayne\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dwayne van Halewijn", "created_at": "December 8, 2015 at 3:55am", "created_by": "DwaynevanHalewijn", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416995", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1417075"}
