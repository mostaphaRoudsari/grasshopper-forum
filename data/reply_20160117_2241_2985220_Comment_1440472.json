{"body": "\nThis is nice Antonello. Thanks.\n\nI have one wish and one think for you to check.\n\nThe wish: To connect the data directly without passing through the LB_separateData. Not critical, but you can save one step in the process.\n\nThe check: Testing the \"second mode\" in your file i noticed that changing the analysis period changes the results. Sometimes the changes are to big to bare. Try month 1 to 4 and then 1 to 8, etc.\n\n\n\nThanks and keep going,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 17, 2016 at 10:41PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1440443", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1440472"}
