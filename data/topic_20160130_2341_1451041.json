{"body": "\nHello everyone,\u00a0\n\nI'm learning honeybee (at last). A bit tricky, considering that tutorials are based on older version but so far everything went pretty smoothly. However here it is, a problem I don't know how to solve.\n\nIt appears in\n\nwhere I need to retrieve .idf file,\n\nand shows this message:\n\n1. Solution exception:'hb_EPZoneSurface' object has no attribute 'punchedGeometry'\n\n\n\nI've added .gh file at a state where I meet the problem.\u00a0\n\nAlso, I've looked around the forum and found some mention OpeanStudio related problems, mainly one's lack of it. Could it be the source of the problem, because I only followed\u00a0[Installation Instructions](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/blob/master/resources/Installation_Instructions.md)\u00a0and haven't installed OpenStudio.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/EqXI2*bZ15*YQ1fLyi7xodcbHgm8kPGJAx3-0MgyWQNKaevfpDQ4O-8lvBegGZxRVcf8yzETKhOy7yOklNzGou5cQhXAZhPb/Canvasat143830.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/EqXI2*bZ15*YQ1fLyi7xodcbHgm8kPGJAx3-0MgyWQNKaevfpDQ4O-8lvBegGZxRVcf8yzETKhOy7yOklNzGou5cQhXAZhPb/Canvasat143830.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1451040", "name": "1 - Mackey Residence Geometry.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "January 30, 2016 at 11:41PM", "created_by": "Timur582", "topic": "RunEnergySimulation error: 'hb_EPZoneSurface' object has no attribute 'punchedGeometry' (from Chris' tutorials)", "id": "topic_1451041"}
