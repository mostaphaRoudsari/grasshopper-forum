{"body": "\nTheodore,\n\n\n\nI just wanted to let you know that the simple multi-objective operation that you have here is very similar to that used by the shade benefit components:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeyb...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeybee_Energy%20Shade%20Benefit%20Evaluator.py#L578-L620)\n\n\n\nYou can see a similar set of formulas on page 4 of the shaderade paper where this type of shade benefit idea originally came from:\n\n[http://web.mit.edu/tito_/www/Publications/BS2011_Shaderade.pdf](http://web.mit.edu/tito_/www/Publications/BS2011_Shaderade.pdf)\n\n\n\nIn the case of the shade benefit, the two competing variables are shade benefit and shade harm and I see how this generalizable description that you gave here is useful for any case where you have two optimization criteria that competing against each other. \u00a0The exponent \"s\" has always been 1 in all of the cases I have worked with but I realize that changing this could be super-useful in the comfort shade benefit to account for the fact that people are usually better at adapting to extreme cold stress than to extreme heat stress. \u00a0I will try to work this in at some point:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/242](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/242)\n\n\n\nThanks for the thoughtful post,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 11, 2016 at 10:16AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1481295", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1482370"}
