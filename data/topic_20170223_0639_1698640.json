{"body": "\nHi all ,\n\nI have modeled a simple HBzone with customized glazing surface, besides I added a plenum zone as a box surrounding the glazed surface..\n\nThe question is, If I want to consider a solar air heater within the plenum zone in which this air heater warms the kept air inside the box for a while until it gets to a specific temperature in case of Winter to deliver it to the HBZone; How do you suggest to model it or at least simplify it to have something similar?\n\n\n\nThanks in Advance\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "AMIR TABADKANI", "created_at": "February 23, 2017 at 06:39AM", "created_by": "AMIRTABADKANI", "topic": "Air Heater in HBPlenumZone?!
