{"body": "\nWhat about sampling all the possibilities and run them instead of running all the possible combinations?\n\nLet's say you have 5 sliders and each of the has values between 0-9 and you only want to test 200 options. This code will generate all those options as lists. Now you can use fly to only iterate between this 200 values using an item selector components.\n\n`import itertools<br/> import random`\n\n# generate values for slider. You can change this to get the values from the sliders.<br/> sliders = (range(10),) * 5\u00a0<br/> population = itertools.product(*sliders)<br/> sample = random.sample(tuple(population), 200)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 29, 2016 at 10:41am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1647993", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1648268"}
