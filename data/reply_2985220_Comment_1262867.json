{"body": "\nHi Nita,\n\nI still don't understand the idea. You want to compare te results of E+ as originally translated from Rhino to those obtained with HB using E+ after importing the idf? Weird, i have to say.\n\nFirst of all it is the same simulation engine, so the only difference can be produced if HB doesn't import all the data in the idf. I think that right now, Mostapha/Chris correct me if i'm wrong, there are some entities/classes that are not imported (blinds and window shades for instance. Not sure what happen with schedules and other definitions). So the easy way is to send the imported idf to simulation and compare both idf files to see the differences.\n\nAs for the specific example i believe the export to E+ spoiled the geometry and flattened the facade faces. I checked that opening the file in open studio (or importing to HB). Another way to check, just to be sure OpenStudio is not making funny things, is manually: Look for the WallSurface class and see the coordinates of the walls. if they have the same X or Y values, for the supposedly inclined walls, then the export was wrong from the beginning.\n\nIf you look for some threads here you'll find that HB can deal with complex geometries,. So why to do this double work ...? So my suggestion in the previous message was to take the original geometry from Rhino and go through the process in HB.\n\nSounds complicated but it isn't so much.\n\n\n\nMakes sense?\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "April 14, 2015 at 6:21am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262721", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262867"}
