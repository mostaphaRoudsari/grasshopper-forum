{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you for your very quick reply, understood.\n\nYes, that is correct, I meant using the \"Import IDF\" component; sorry, it was not very clear.\n\nThe air walls come out to be previewed as WALLS using the \"Decompose by type component\". So, according to what you are saying I should not get worried for this.\n\nDo you think it is appropriate to model a horizontal air wall using the \"standard\" air wall type usually used for the vertical condition? I mean that the air convection mechnism is different between the two cases, vertical and horizontal, and therefore also the mixing of the air should be different.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nCarmelo\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1584670", "name": "Air walls_Import IDF.png"}], "created_by_name": "Carmelo G.
