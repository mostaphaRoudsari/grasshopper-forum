{"body": "\nHo Mostapha and Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for the input.\n\n\n\nI agree with all of your comments. Copying is the only way I'm doing it now but as Chris mentioned that requires us to re-set all the material information. This actually works like a charm in Daylighting studies mainly due to no limitation from radiance side to closed zones and so on. All I need to do for daylighting is make sure that all surfaces are divided in layers and then copy paste as many floors I want and input each layer in a brep afterwards.\n\n\n\nI think if we can use native components to add zones to HB that would have an immense impact to our models (or maybe just mine :) ). So it's good news this is added on the list.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "September 09, 2015 at 08:55PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1357328", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1358773"}
