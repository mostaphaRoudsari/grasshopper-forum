{"body": "\nHi Chris and thanks for the tips.\n\nTrying to simplify the process i defined a test file (attached). So i have some questions and probably a bug report.\n\nThere are 3 zones. I want the internal walls between them to be adiabatic (at first. See later on for an alternative).\n\nThe whole process is fine/clear up to the solveAdjacencies: The walls are defined as \"outdoors\" and \"surface\" for the boundary conditions. So far so good.\n\nNow i get to the HB_makeAdiabaticByType, and some issues appear (See A in the file).\n\nSetting the interiorWalls to True doesn't change the condition from\"surface\" to \"adiabatic\" (A1 in file).\n\nSetting the walls set both internal and external, to adiabatic (A2 in file). Is this supposed to work like this? Why the just the internal doesn't make the change?\n\n\n\nIn addition to this i'll appreciate your advice in the following. Let's say that i want the internal walls to be divided in 2 parts each. One should be adiabatic and the other \"air wall\". How do you recommend to do this? Is the modeling in the file correct, or i must do surface by surface?Or using the Decompose Honeybee Zone ...?\n\nHow can i retain the air walls and still use the makeAdiabaticByType component?\n\n\n\nThanks for your help!!\n\n-A.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1465059", "name": "TestBoundaryConditions.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 17, 2016 at 04:57AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463955", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1465058"}
