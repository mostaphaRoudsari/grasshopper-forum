{"body": "\nLetizia,\n\nGlad that the construction and ground temperature issues are solved. \u00a0I have plans to add in a bunch more stuff with adaptive comfort but I am glad that you were able to solve it with the outputs:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/143](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/143)\n\nTo answer your questions about the additionalStrings, it only writes things in addition to what is already written. \u00a0It cannot overwrite the things defined in the connected Honeybee zones.\n\nThe default oupenStudio schedules for people gains are very simple. \u00a0They are literally just a number of people/m2 multiplied by the schedule value and a number of watts/person (represented as an \"occupancy activity\" schedule). \u00a0You can change the number of people/m2 with the \"Set EnergyPlus Zone Loads\" component and you can change the people occupancy schedule just by plugging in a CSV schedule into the \"Set EnergyPlus Zone Schedules\" component. \u00a0You can change the occupant activity (or metabolic rate) of the people by plugging a CSV schedule into the\u00a0\"Set EnergyPlus Zone Schedules\" component.\n\nMy guess is that, if you need a proxy for clothing effects or the rate at which the people heat is going to the zone, editing the occupancy activity will be the closest to what you are expecting. \u00a0However, I get the sense that occupant clothing should not matter much if your occupants are in the zone long enough to reach equilibrium with it. \u00a0Are your occupants only in the space for a brief time or are they adding/removing clothing a lot?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 06, 2015 at 08:34PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256730", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1257744"}
