{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\nYes. This is an error that raise by the new check that I added for finding containerId. As you can see there is an ERROR! line in the report but then there is no error reported. Let's try to remove the check and see if that makes any difference. Can you go to \"C:\\Users\\sdezj\\AppData\\Roaming\\McNeel\\Rhinoceros\\5.0\\scripts\\butterfly\" and replace runmanager.py with the attached file. You need to close both Rhino and Grasshopper and re-open them so Grasshopper re-loads butterfly library.\n\nLet me know if it solves the issue.\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1579669", "name": "runmanager.py"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 10, 2016 at 07:16AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579522", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1579668"}
