{"body": "\nThank you @Pin . I know what you mean - using the analysis period we can manipulate the final result the way we want. For instance - using that just for the \"comfortable\" periods we can show its a good climate and showing it for the \"hostile\" - contrary... Therefore it would seem best to compare the climate by the whole year time range, but that just could be misleading or difficult in many ways...\n\n... and that's where @djordje clarified a few things for me - really awesome, thank you for that!! Do you have some book or website to recommend? I would like to get a deeper background knowledge and be able to recognize these subtle differences...\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jacek Urbanowicz", "created_at": "June 23, 2016 at 07:10AM", "created_by": "JacekUrbanowicz", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1551923", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1554342"}
