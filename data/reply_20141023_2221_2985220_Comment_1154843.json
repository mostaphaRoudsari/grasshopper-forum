{"body": "\nAaron,\n\nSorry for coming into the discussion so late. \u00a0I feel partly responsible as my video showed a method for making a custom window construction but we currently have no component to make a custom glass material (only a component to make a custom window material). \u00a0Your second file uses the custom window material correctly since the window material is meant to represent an entire window element (including all panes of glass and the frame). \u00a0Right now, if you want a custom glass material, which you could use in layered constructions and would work with your first file, you have to input a text string in IDF language (as you see in the attached file here). \u00a0Now that I see the demand for it, I think I will write a component this weekend that produces this string for you automatically and allows you to make a custom glass material. \u00a0I will post here once I have done so.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1154845", "name": "FurtherTesting3_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 23, 2014 at 10:21PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1154288", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1154843"}
