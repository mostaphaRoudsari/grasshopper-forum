{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you very much for the detailed clarification!\n\n\n\nI agree that Ideal Loads Air System is useful in estimating cooling and heating loads, and help to identify problematic areas in the design that may need to be improved. When comes to estimating energy consumption, the COP of the HVAC system needs to be taken into account. And with the implementation of a realistic full HVAC, definitely the source energy may also need to be analyzed that considers the various types of energy used to generate the site energy.\n\n\n\nThe three building level performance metrics you suggested to evaluate the impact of building design are surely very important.\n\n\n\nAlso thanks for sharing the hourly EUI workflow!\n\n\n\nOne more question is how to aggregate zone level of data. Eg. how to get total electricity for lights and equipment for each zone, monthly or yearly?\n\n\n\nI tried the following workflow using your hourly EUI demo file, but the color legend doesn't seem to recognize the name of zone, probably due to the use of the create LB header component.\n\n\n\nWould you suggest other way to aggregate multiple variables for each zone?\n\n<br/>Thanks!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2KO5TIlF0st2OUSxnrGMKZHWwsq6StJwWcFBksVLUC5p2oKMg1Bz-YSHmoFHa1Ita1du3TB9cih9hoXasgYQoXa3lUwf2fPU/Image10.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2KO5TIlF0st2OUSxnrGMKZHWwsq6StJwWcFBksVLUC5p2oKMg1Bz-YSHmoFHa1Ita1du3TB9cih9hoXasgYQoXa3lUwf2fPU/Image10.png)[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2KO5TIlF0ss98mZ6okSM*6qV2iU8DZprUblc-IZGO-VhziP5g40K6EEgDQU4UTftnKtGgl8iB3UVbpA4Ta-mwxLxbNLMCs-u/Image9.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2KO5TIlF0ss98mZ6okSM*6qV2iU8DZprUblc-IZGO-VhziP5g40K6EEgDQU4UTftnKtGgl8iB3UVbpA4Ta-mwxLxbNLMCs-u/Image9.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1581280", "name": "HourlyEUI _ZJ.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 14, 2016 at 04:19AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1581317", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1581279"}
