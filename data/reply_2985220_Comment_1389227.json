{"body": "\nOK, i was wrong ... <br/><br/>The demo GH file is fine. It's just that the EP construction \"GroundMaterial\" needs to be reconnected to the input nodes on the Set EP Zone Construction component to make it work.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, it is still strange why the reconnection is needed...\n\n\n\nAnd I also want to ask why this 5-layer concrete construction needs to be connected to both the Set EP Zone construction and Set Underground construction components...\n\n\n\nPls kindly advise! Thanks!\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "October 29, 2015 at 8:40am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "topic_1389150", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1389227"}
