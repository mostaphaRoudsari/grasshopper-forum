{"body": "\nFor getting separate schedules out of daylighting simulation you just need to split the floor surface into multiple surfaces, so when you are generating the test points each surfaces will be in a separate branch.\n\nI assume in EnergyPlus you need to split your zones anyways if you want to apply different lighting schedules.\u00a0I'm not sure though - there might be a solution for that if you post your question to (unmethours.com). Nevertheless if you are creating multiple zones with airwalls make sure to set exportAirWalls to False when for daylighting simulation so it doesn't affect the results of daylighting analysis.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 23, 2015 at 8:42pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1230617", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1230405"}
