{"body": "\nHi Alejandro,\n\nEvery time that I show annual glare ti someone I warn him/her about the annual glare analysis and encourage them to cross reference the results. I don't think it's a mistake from your side. I have seen discrepancies too and stopped using the annual glare analysis but maybe both of us making a mistake!\n\nHave you tried to plot the annual results in 3DChart? Does it show a reasonable pattern?\n\nI would say this is a great question for Daysim email list. Jan is on the list and should be able to tell us why this is happening.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 11, 2016 at 6:34pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1436352", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1436861"}
