{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nMy energy Plus model keeps failing. I identified the problem and have a workaround, but wanted to share in case anyone else runs into something similar.\n\n\n\nI am making a large EPlus model from custom zones\u00a0created through individually defined HBSurfaces. I am piping about 50 zones with roughly 20 fa\u00e7ade panels each into a single idf file. My branching structure creates a lot of\u00a0similarly named surfaces.\u00a0Eplus fails because similarly named surfaces are automatically renamed \"SurfaceName_Dup_Dup_Dup.........\" until the names are so long that\u00a0Eplus truncates them. This seems to crash the program in a variety of different ways. I don't know exactly why this happens, but I solved the error by assigning a unique name to each HBsurface. I used the data tree path of the inputs to create random numbers and then appended this unique number to a common title.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt would be great if Honeybee could rename all duplicate HBsurfaces with a unique random number, like a serial number,\u00a0rather than appending _Dup to each new option. Is this possible or is that an Eplus thing?\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leland Curtis", "created_at": "June 24, 2015 at 05:04PM", "created_by": "LelandCurtis", "topic": "EPlus error: Surface_Dup_Dup names getting truncated", "id": "topic_1315098"}
