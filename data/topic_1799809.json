{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am hoping someone could help me with this issue.\n\nWhen I run annual simulation, I get the following error message from the \"readAnnualResultsl\";\n\n1. Can't sort .ill files based on the file names. Make sure branches are sorted correctly.<br/>1. Solution exception:Could not find a part of the path 'C:\\Ladybug\\Annual\\annualSimulation\\'.\n\n<br/>It looks like \"runDaylightAnalysis\" component is not generating .ill files in the folder.<br/>But \"runDaylightAnalysis\" is not outputting any error message.\n\n\n\nWhen I run it, command screen wizzes through so I don't think it's running annual simulation at all. Am I putting in wrong settings for Daysim / Radiance?<br/><br/>\n\nI would appreciate any help.\n\nThank you in advance!<br/><br/>\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1799806", "name": "error_01.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1799807", "name": "error_02.PNG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1799808", "name": "forum_question_v.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Bo Jung", "created_at": "August 17, 2017 at 10:04am", "created_by": "BoJung", "topic": "Annual Daylight Simulation not outputting .ill files", "id": "topic_1799809"}
