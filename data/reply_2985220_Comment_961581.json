{"body": "\nThanks for the comment. It reminded me that I actually considered this! I added an output to viewAnalysis component (\"ptIsVisible\") at the last minute to let the users do stuff like this. :)\n\nIt is similar to intersectionMtx: A list of 0s and 1s that shows if the test point is visible. You need to flip the matrix and count the number of 1s and divide it by the length of the list. Here is how you can set it up:\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/1Q*fTOyGxIDiE74v78RAOg9yD9gBj*gbrTSCcrpaYPTrXuWmtyHNP7-Qe0263k6ieKbo3QLuXjwoip7aubQmHGM7ZHapzXfk/viewAnalysis_04.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/1Q*fTOyGxIDiE74v78RAOg9yD9gBj*gbrTSCcrpaYPTrXuWmtyHNP7-Qe0263k6ieKbo3QLuXjwoip7aubQmHGM7ZHapzXfk/viewAnalysis_04.png)\n\nThe result is 1% different from the last example. I think it happens because the test points are not exactly the same.\n\nHopefully I get it right this time! :)\n\nMostaphaMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A961582", "name": "viewAnalysis_04.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 21, 2013 at 12:17pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_961486", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_961581"}
