{"body": "\nHi Ding,\n\nThank you for the informative reply.\n\nPlease find the answer to your questions in the attached file. For some of them I need more time. Again your questions are best suited for github. It should be easier to track the questions as separate issues. It can easily get lost inside a gh file.\n\nThe issues with importing schedules and loads are shortcomings of DesignBuilder importer. Honeybee assigns and exports them. Let's wait for a reply from DesignBuilder team.\n\nI don't suggest you to customize gbXML file as it is an standard format and it should stay the same between different programs.\n\nNevertheless what is the advantage of DesignBuilder for your project? Is it possible to use OpenStudio instead of DB?\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1095304", "name": "GrizzlyBeartest_msr_dy3.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 29, 2014 at 10:58PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1094469", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1095303"}
