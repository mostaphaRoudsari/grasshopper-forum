{"body": "\nHi there,\n\n\u00a0\n\nI have been developing a general\u00a0definition that allows a window surface to follow the path of the sun. I have done this by taking the vector of the sun path and allowing the surface to be perpendicular to it at all times.\n\nAlthough conceptual, the definition works fine but I think it is too clunky.\n\nI am using too many vector directions, surface splits and list item componants in my opinion. could any one give me any advice on how to refine the definition?\n\n\u00a0\n\nI have included the .3dm file and the .gha file for inspection.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\u00a0\n\nJohn Egan\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A912622", "name": "sunpath-AJ01 jOHNS VERSION.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A912623", "name": "Johns_Version GH question.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "John Egan", "created_at": "September 10, 2013 at 08:09AM", "created_by": "JohnEgan", "topic": "Ladybug, cleaning up Window response definition", "id": "topic_912624"}
