{"body": "\nHi Chris,<br/><br/>So it's not an Energy Plus issue and in some way I should be able to solve it. Great piece of news.<br/><br/>I attach 2 files. The first one shows the two horizontal windows with the previously mentioned errors. In the \" - copy\" version you can find an attempt of giving to the windows a slightly inclination by changing the z-values of few points. In this second case I get the blinds but they have a crazy geometry. For example if you give bigger values in order to see them more clearly they overlap and it looks like if changing their rotation value makes them moving in the same plane of the window.<br/><br/>The dimensions are pretty big compared to the roof they're inserted in, but I already tried to reduce the windows' dimensions and leave a bigger \"frame\" around them and nothing changed.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance for your precious help.<br/>Claudio\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1416997", "name": "BlindOnHorizontalWindow.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1416998", "name": "BlindOnHorizontalWindow - Copy.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio Marini", "created_at": "December 08, 2015 at 03:43AM", "created_by": "ClaudioMarini", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1417030", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1416995"}
