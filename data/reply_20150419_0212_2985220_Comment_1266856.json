{"body": "\nThanks Abraham.\n\n\n\nAt least one issue is out.\n\n\n\nI managed to clean the file a bit. Not the structure unfortunately but the geometry variables. I cleared internal and external walls appropriately. In the preview component though I can see three main issues:\n\n1. 3 Window surfaces are listed as internal windows even though they are on external surfaces. I don't know how I can define a window as internal in honeybee. Tried changing the normals but didn't work. This is an EP option so is the idf editor the only way?\n\n\n\n2. 2 surfaces show up on external surfaces even though they are internal.\n\n\n\n3. A whole zone (the grouped zone on the left, corridor) is not previewed. It is the only zone I cannot manage to close. And I am not sure why it is open. In the preview there is a weird thing however. The wirefreme looks bended somehow.\n\n\n\nDespite all the above, the same errors keep coming up. Specifically the adiabatic surfaces cannot have windows or openings I do not understand. I realize that a surface like \"ground\", \"ceiling\", or \"floor\" cannot have openings but I checked and all of them are wall surfaces. And finall the outside boundary condition error. I'm stomped. And I can't but help feeling it's some stupid mistake I made and I can't see.\n\n\n\nThank you all in advance.\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1266857", "name": "TicketingAdmin.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 19, 2015 at 02:12AM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1266757", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1266856"}
