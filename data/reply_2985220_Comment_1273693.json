{"body": "\nThanks Abraham,\n\nAll makes sense, I see where I went wrong, and now I've got some numbers out of totalSolarGain which is great. However rotate3D goes through setEPZoneConstruction and seems to be cancelled out, so no rotation.\n\nI guess the energy data/numbers are for the model windows facing east/west.
