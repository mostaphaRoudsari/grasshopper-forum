{"body": "\nHey Abraham,\n\n\n\nyes, so:\n\nfor outside temperatures below 10C the indoor temperature must be in a range of 20-24C.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nfor outside temperatures above 10C the indoor temperature must be in a range of 23-26C.\n\nSo the indoor set point temperature depends on the outside temperature. I know it might sound a bit silly for thermal comfort.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor example in summer (when temp can reach 20 or 28C) the indoor temperature might still be 21C than the room is heated to 23C, but due to internal gains the indoor temp can also reach 28C, than you must obviously cool down to\u00a023-26C.\n\n\n\nSo therfore I need two setpoint on both heating and cooling, where you normally set the range for the whole year or half a year (summer/winter).\n\n\n\nAs can be seen from the figure, the red shows the time when the indoor temperature should be in a range of 23-26, this is where the outside temp is equal or above 10C.\n\n\n\nHope this explaination and examples help to understand the issue.\n\n\n\nGr.
