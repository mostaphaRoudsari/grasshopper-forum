{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI opened the imageBasedSimulation folder. I saw\u00a05 hdr files.\u00a0 I was able to open 4\u00a0of them (0,1,2,3) without any issues.\u00a0 The composite one does not open and I get an error (see the attached screen capture).\n\nI think the\u00a0problem\u00a0is\u00a0during compositing the four sub images into the whole image.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to circumvent this split into four and re-compositing exercise?\u00a0 I like the old scheme where we did not have this. Can I change the script to do that? I don't mind opening the folder and running the script from there.\n\nThanks,\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1767516", "name": "Capture.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Ibby", "created_at": "June 10, 2017 at 11:25PM", "created_by": "Ibby", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1767376", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1767515"}
