{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha,<br/> <br/> I just picked up Ladybug again for potential implementation in a workshop we're hosting in a few weeks. I'm very impressed by both the quantity and the quality of all the new features (Honeybee!!). Excellent work, once again ;)<br/> <br/> Now onto my issue. I'm running solar radiation analysis on meshes generated using Kangaroo. It seems that if a mesh face has quite acute angles it does not seem to \"pick up\" any radiation:<br/> <br/> [<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/3dClu3zYZutCIHim-eqT9M6nW0QX2oijf4hzQivIzi-ELEQKeaW7HQdOEJzv6qICTQZK5*OKggSIBSPOmk007ly3Bbe9mJrc/140611_LadyBug_Radiation_AcuteMeshFacesProblem.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/3dClu3zYZutCIHim-eqT9M6nW0QX2oijf4hzQivIzi-ELEQKeaW7HQdOEJzv6qICTQZK5*OKggSIBSPOmk007ly3Bbe9mJrc/140611_LadyBug_Radiation_AcuteMeshFacesProblem.PNG)In the image an excerpt of the same form found mesh is being analysed using the\u00a0radiationAnalysis component. Mesh A is the original mesh displaying the issue. In Mesh B I have manually moved the offending vertices, thus resolving the issue.<br/> <br/> I haven't looked through the Python code yet, hoping that you maybe would know what the issue is straight off the bat :D<br/> <br/> I have attached the Rhino file, GH definition and the EPW file I'm using.\n\n<br/> Best,<br/> <br/> Anders\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1086755", "name": "140611_LadyBug_Radiation_AcuteMeshFacesProblem.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1086756", "name": "140611_LadyBug_Radiation_AcuteMeshFacesProblem.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1086663", "name": "DEU_Hamburg.101470_IWEC.epw"}], "created_by_name": "Anders Holden Deleuran", "created_at": "June 11, 2014 at 7:02am", "created_by": "AndersHoldenDeleuran", "topic": "Acute Mesh Face Angles Issue", "id": "topic_1086757"}
