{"body": "\nHello all,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to work with Radiance Trans Material but I'm having little trouble understading how it works.\n\nI've read the document \"\u2018Trans Materials \u2013Modeling and Specifying a Next Generation\" by\u00a0David Mead ([http://radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2010-freiburg/PDF/Da...](http://radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2010-freiburg/PDF/DavidMead.pdf)). It was very helpful but still I'm not confident with this kind of material.\n\n\n\nI'll explain shortly my design.\n\nI'm trying to bring natural light deeper into a generic building. To do so, I want to use a system in which a mirror outside the facade directs the sunlight through a horizontal shaft composed of mirrors on the upper part and on the sides with a \"membrane\" on the lower side defined as a \"Trans Material\".\n\n\n\nMy goal is to obtain an effect like the one showed in the attached photo. It's a skylight make of opaque semi-transparent plastic.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDoes anyone know any good parameter to simulate that?\n\n\n\nI'm attaching also a little section and the gh file.\n\n\n\nThanks everybody for your help.\n\n\n\nAlessandro\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1417339", "name": "IMG_8551.JPG"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1417340", "name": "Diffusore.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1417341", "name": "Scene.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Alessandro Corso", "created_at": "December 08, 2015 at 08:17AM", "created_by": "AlessandroCorso", "topic": "Radiance Trans Material question.", "id": "topic_1417342"}
