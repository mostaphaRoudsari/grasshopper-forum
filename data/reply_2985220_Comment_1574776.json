{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\nmany many thanks for digging into this so deeply, that result does indeed look more like the real thing. It also works as advertised on the local machines here :)\n\nI will try to run it on the 40+ zone model as well, will share that with you once it's done. Very happy the time and effort (much more yours than mine!) has paid off for both of us and the community! I'll be in touch soon &amp; thanks again,\n\nBest,\n\nMax\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Max D", "created_at": "August 2, 2016 at 5:45am", "created_by": "ButWhyprecisely", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1574462", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1574776"}
