{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\n74.43 Wh/m2 looks right to me. If you convert it to KWh/2 it will be 0.0744 which is equal to 0.1 if you round the number. What do you expect the result to be?\n\nAlso two points to keep in mind:\n\n1. As you already mentioned weather files are not the same.\n\n2. Vasari's results is not validated so if you want to compare the results I suggest you to compare Ladybug's result to Honeybee (RADIANCE). Claudio has already done a comparative analysis if you are interested: ([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/data-reliab...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/data-reliability?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1047525&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)).\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "July 09, 2014 at 07:58PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1099996", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1099998"}
