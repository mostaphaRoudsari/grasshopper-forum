But here for 800 points I'm using 1.7 minutte just loading the data into GH. In the meanwhile I'm only using 15 seconds on the simulation itself. I think using some external script that can run multicore, we should be able to speed up this process. I'm looking for the peak radiation in each point (w/m2).\n\n\n\nSo if this \"external script\" could find the max of each point before importing to mono-core grasshopper framework. That would be great. Postprocessing in grasshopper is also quite slow with 800x8760 values.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mathias s n", "created_at": "September 8, 2015 at 7:32am", "created_by": "Mathiassn", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1356477", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1356872"}
