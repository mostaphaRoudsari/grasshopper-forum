{"body": "\nThe \"**Outdoor Microclimate Map**\" demo file on Hydra used a customized **GroundMaterial** construction for the underground thermal zone acting as the ground surface that may accumulate heat.\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Outdoor_Microclimate_Map)\n\n\n\nIt seems that this construction should be disconnected with the **Set EP Zone Construction** component (see image below). Otherwise, there will be severe error related to the underground zone surface construction:\n\n**1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error:** <br/> **\u00a0\u00a0 ** Severe\u00a0 ** BuildingSurface:Detailed=\"GROUNDZONE_SRF_2\", invalid Construction Name=\"GROUNDMATERIAL\".**<br/>\n\nCan kind Chris help to verify if it is the case?\n\n\n\nCan kind Chris also help to share a bit more on why outdoor thermal comfort is calculated in this way?\n\n\n\nThank you very much!\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/iM6nZUUaDa4DuaaHVKFTBXiRDfjJtQj9DMKr8FOEokR*yUP*x5M8ucDUe4omhBJhwxtrefo7u227AJu5farLfeseUye0Bggx/01.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/iM6nZUUaDa4DuaaHVKFTBXiRDfjJtQj9DMKr8FOEokR*yUP*x5M8ucDUe4omhBJhwxtrefo7u227AJu5farLfeseUye0Bggx/01.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "October 29, 2015 at 08:06AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "groundMaterial used in the \"Outdoor Microclimate Map\" demo file on Hydra", "id": "topic_1389150"}
