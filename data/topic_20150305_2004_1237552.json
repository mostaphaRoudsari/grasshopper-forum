{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI am playing around with the wind boundary profile and I wanted to discuss some of my questions and ideas.\n\n\n\nFirst, I was wondering if it is possible to get a value output in the component for the wind direction and wind speed at the different heights. This would allow a link of the component's results to other simulations (e.g. cfd).\n\n\n\nSecond, I realize epw files store wind speed and direction on the prevailing wind. Would it be possible to create a wind boundary profile for a specific direction? Perhaps adding 0's to every hour that the direction is not the prevailing average direction in the epw file output. Does that make sense?\n\n\n\nThird, is the component calculating the wind profile using the power law? It would be amazing if it could also provide a log wind profile. Not sure if that is easy to implement.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if the log wind profile could be implemented, perhaps an input of context geometry would allow for some cool investigations in urban contexts. It could calculate the average height value of the geometries, providing a quick calculation of zero displacement zones.\n\n\n\nFinally, control over input variables would be great, for example selecting custom ground roughness values.\n\n\n\nSorry for the barrage. Hope most of this makes sense. Comments and thoughts are welcome.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "March 05, 2015 at 08:04PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Wind boundary profile - questions and wishlist", "id": "topic_1237552"}
