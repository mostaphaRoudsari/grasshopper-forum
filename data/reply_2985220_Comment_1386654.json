{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI've subscribed to your and Mackey's channel long time ago. Ladybug is pretty user friendly and intuitive. My problem is in how to give meaningful explanation to my colleagues when I show them ladybug's charts and graphs (btw, they love them). Thanks for the suggestions, Mona and you are right, I will google about. Any good books that you could recommend to start with?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "October 26, 2015 at 9:18pm", "created_by": "Timur582", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1386734", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1386654"}
