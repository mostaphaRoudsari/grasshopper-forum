{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, the OpenStudio output log is really helpful ! I can use that to create a similar workflow in Grasshopper/Honeybee. By the way, is there a 2-phase(ie daysim type daylight-coefficient) implementation in honeybee right now ? I know from reading your code that you create a .hea (daysim-header) file for annual daylighting simulations. Do you also have a rcontrib based annual daylighting calculation implemented somewhere ? I got the two phase calculations, with rmtxop and gendaymtx, to work yesterday and they seem to work a lot faster than Daysim. I still don't know if the illuminance values being generated by it are right/reasonable or not. \u00a0\n\n\n\n(Dont' know why, but I am not able to reply to your last comment directly)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "October 31, 2015 at 10:12am", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1388765", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1390149"}
