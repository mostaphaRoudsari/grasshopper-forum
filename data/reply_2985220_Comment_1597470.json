{"body": "\nFrancesco and Ernesto,\n\nThanks for letting me know about this and I just fixed the link in the install instructions.\n\nJust so that you guys are in the loop, there's been a new version of the UWG released with a much cleaner way of inputting data. \u00a0I am going to be rewriting Dragonfly to work with this soon. \u00a0This will also coincide with a much cleaner install method for Dragonfly and a Dragonfly API.\n\nStay tuned!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "September 11, 2016 at 4:20pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1596151", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1597470"}
