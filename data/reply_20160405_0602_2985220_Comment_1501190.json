{"body": "\nThe small window is intended for user comfort and the big window to enhance the energy efficieny.\n\nThe DGP data format is the same as you get from the HB simulation. (it works when the file is in the annual simulation folder - looks like the other data from the folder is needed(ViewPoints/Direction)? I have attached a file))\n\n\n\nI put both windows in one AddHBGlz component.

Like 0.25=25%, 0.5=50%?\n\nWhen I set the darkest dimming state as shade material, what about the characteristics (reflectance and transmittance) of the shade material? Does it adapt?\n\n(Apropos characteristics, is it the solar or the visible reflectance?)\n\n\n\n-Jakob\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1501191", "name": "DGP_DIVA.dgp"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1501192", "name": "windowsurfaces_baked.PNG"}], "created_by_name": "Jakob Schmidt", "created_at": "April 05, 2016 at 06:02AM", "created_by": "JakobSchmidt", "parent_id": "topic_1496352", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1501190"}
