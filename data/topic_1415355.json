{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nMy GH crashes every time I tried to connect the weed speed data to Psychrometric Chart component. I know I don't have to plug it but just the existence of that node with a 100% crash feature doesn't feel good.\n\nMy GH is 0076 and Rhino 5 SR12. Using Ladybug 0.0.61.\n\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\nBTW, did you graduate from UPENN? I think we took same seminar in 2010.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Furion Huang", "created_at": "December 4, 2015 at 3:30pm", "created_by": "FurionHuang", "topic": "Psychrometric Chart Crashes when Connects windSpeed", "id": "topic_1415355"}
