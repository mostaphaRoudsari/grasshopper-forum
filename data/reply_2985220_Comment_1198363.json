{"body": "\nHmmmm ....<br/>I can swear that i tried this and get the \"natVent\" error message. Sorry.\n\n\n\nStill, after the update the HB_ColorSurfaces is giving error messages:\n\n1. None of the connected srfData could be matched with the surfaces in the connected HBZones. Note that this component does not currenlty work for curved geometry E+ simulations because the surfaces are broken up and meshed in order to run it through E+.\n\nThe previous file gave surface results for opaque envelope, and errors for windows. Now you don't get any.\n\nI'm a pain this 2015 ... :-)\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 3, 2015 at 10:57pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1198444", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1198363"}
