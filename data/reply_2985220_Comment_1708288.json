{"body": "\nHi Wigg,\n\nThe issue with \"PV SWH System Size\" component not accounting for **north_** input has been fixed.<br/>So right now all Ladybug Photovoltaics components support **north_** input apart from graphical representation of the \"Tilt And Orientation Factor (TOF)\" component.<br/>This is what graphical representation means:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/F2Psn398QBw8ZCudFxWyhp*T2kIIGpkxBdMXWVN3ZqCImni-LsW2q8AfHo248mUTKwaC0gynjoEWU4g5BpSL0a*IUWm4nx5n/tof_Gatwick.jpg?width=250\" width=\"250\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/F2Psn398QBw8ZCudFxWyhp*T2kIIGpkxBdMXWVN3ZqCImni-LsW2q8AfHo248mUTKwaC0gynjoEWU4g5BpSL0a*IUWm4nx5n/tof_Gatwick.jpg)\n\n\n\nSo even though the north angle of \"40\" has been inputted in upper **Photovoltaics shaded analysis.gh** file, the \"TOF\" component will still show the graphical result as if north is defined at 0. I do not think I will be changing this, as it will require from me to rewrite much of the \"TOF\" component.<br/>\"TOF\"'s numerical calculation will support the **north_** input which is what is important.<br/>This is what numerical calculation is (the numerical outputs):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/F2Psn398QBxHaKk7fQLzd-8go0yCyVJnHdf3B8T9L2W-HnCh0EqKp2INFFvZkrsrUoJBdGmtWgbMOAIEtUduh10uLuTbRKcr/numericalOutputs.jpg?width=250\" width=\"250\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/F2Psn398QBxHaKk7fQLzd-8go0yCyVJnHdf3B8T9L2W-HnCh0EqKp2INFFvZkrsrUoJBdGmtWgbMOAIEtUduh10uLuTbRKcr/numericalOutputs.jpg)\n\n\n\nSo I attached a new grasshopper definition below where all components have **north_** input set to \"40\" and your context has been rotated back to -40, as you had it on the very beginning.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1708289", "name": "Photovoltaics shaded analysis2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "March 8, 2017 at 5:53pm", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1705303", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1708288"}
