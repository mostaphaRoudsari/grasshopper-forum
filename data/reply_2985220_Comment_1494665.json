{"body": "\nHello All,\n\n\n\nThank you for working through this issue together and I apologize for my messy code that tries to work around some of Rhino's deficiencies with solid operations.\n\n\n\nNow that I have understood how complex this operation of splitting building masses is, I think that the best way of addressing issues like this is to break up this component in two: one component to split masses into floors and another component to split floors into core/perimeter zones. \u00a0With this organization, it will be easier to build up a library of functions that can divide floors into core/perimeter, which is the main function that is failing here. \u00a0I have put this on the to-do list:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/497](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/issues/497)\n\nUntil I can get around to this or someone else takes on the challenge, you might have to play around with the component a bit (as yo have done Michael and Antonello) to get useful results.\n\n\n\nI apologize I can't be more help for the time being.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 28, 2016 at 8:37pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1494404", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1494665"}
