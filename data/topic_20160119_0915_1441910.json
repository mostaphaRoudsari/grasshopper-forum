{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\nI have got a problem with ****HoneyBee_RADParameters**** component, because\u00a0when i change the default\u00a0inputs (like _ab_, _ad_, _as_, ...), even if the output \"out\" shows the inputs i have changed, during the simulation i can see from the black window of the radiance simulation\u00a0that i still have default values, excepting for ab that is changed.\n\nI have also checked the \"range\" of the values according to radiance\u00a0and\u00a0the values i put\u00a0are in the domain so i\u00a0may exclude that problem.\n\nDo you know where is the problem? What do you suggest?\n\nI hope you\u00b4ll help me to\u00a0solve this problem because it should be a way to decrease the time to run a daylight simulation!!!\n\nThanks a lot in advance\n\nClaudia\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "January 19, 2016 at 09:15AM", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "Problem with HoneyBee_RADParameter component", "id": "topic_1441910"}
