{"body": "\nHllo\n\n\n\nfirst of all thank you to the both of you..\n\nI read carefully both answer but I'm not sure i'm understanding your answers..\u00a0\n\nI made so many different surfaces because I wanted to analyse the solar availability on each orientation.\n\nBut to make thinks (hopefuly! :-) ) clearer, I attach a simplified version of my analysis using the same one surface to run the three different cases. I assume that the direction of the surface is now the same, still results are different. The top case in rhino correspond to the top case in the GH canvas, the lower in Rhino to the lower in GH..\n\n\n\nI expected a difference in each run.. but the cases differ of 100% not 10% that would be reasonable..\u00a0\n\n\n\nCase 1 \u00a0 158 W/m2 for the \"only test point\" option\n\nCase 2 \u00a0 314 W/m2 for the \"test point + pts Vectors\" case\n\nCase 3 \u00a0 282 W/m2 for the ladybug option\n\n\n\nThe analysis is made the day 1 , hour 12h \u00a0and the the solar radiation condition are:\n\nDirect 125 W/m2\n\nDiffuse \u00a0164 W/m2\n\nGlobal Horiz 207 W/m2\n\n\n\nThe interesting thing is that the three cases made for the orizontal surface give the same results. \u00a0 \u00a0**\u00a0**\n\nmoreover if the materials reflectance is changed to 1, the results are very similar but the values are higher than the sum of direct + diffuse as for case 2\n\n**125+164 = 289 \u00a0 results give 314\u00a0**\n\n\n\n(diffuse radiation is obviously calculated on horizontal surface in the weather file and the surface analysis is vertical so the percentage of diffuse radiation that the surface will receive will be even less).\n\n\n\nHope that I've been clearer and sorry if you already have answered my question, but I'm not understanding the results. (i'm not a GH pro-user but I'm quite familiar with analysis and these stuff)\n\n\n\nThank you again\n\nfilippo\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1724004", "name": "Comparison_simplified.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1724005", "name": "Comparison_simplified.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Filippo", "created_at": "March 30, 2017 at 07:46AM", "created_by": "Filippo430", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1724068", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1724003"}
