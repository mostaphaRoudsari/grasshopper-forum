{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\nI know you are super busy right now rewriting and improving the code. If it is possible (and maybe a good time to?) I'd like to ask for adding a functional transparency to PNGs (without color loss or baking). Once again quite often instead of pasting a diagram, I have to clean up white background from the image (which is not hard but leaves some artefacts).\n\nAnyway, I brought this issue up before and if it is something useful for others too, it would be mega awesome to see this feature in the next release.\n\nWhat do you think? What people think, is it just me?\n\nHave a nice day.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "April 5, 2016 at 1:19am", "created_by": "Timur582", "topic": "Wish: Add transparency to Capture View component", "id": "topic_1501155"}
