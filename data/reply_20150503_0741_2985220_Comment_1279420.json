{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nThank you so much for the very helpful tutorial and your explanation!\u00a0But, I have still one more question just to make sure I understand right regarding the \"total energy\".\u00a0\n\n\n\nConsidering that the \"totalEnergy\" has been removed from the \"read EP result\" component, but what shall we do\u00a0if we still want to obtain the simulation result of\u00a0the \"total energy\" ? -\u00a0Is that true that the\u00a0sum of\u00a0the thermal (heating/cooling) energy and the electric (light and equipment) energy obtained from the\u00a0\"read EP result\" component is equal to\u00a0the \"total energy\" used by the zone?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition,\u00a0is it expected\u00a0to integrate the \"daylight threshold\" function to the EP simulation again\u00a0in near future\u00a0? Just for curious.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you again!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nDing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ding", "created_at": "May 03, 2015 at 07:41AM", "created_by": "doudou", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279022", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1279420"}
