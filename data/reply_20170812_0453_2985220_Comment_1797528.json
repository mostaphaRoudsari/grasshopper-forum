{"body": "Aryan,\n\nThanks for finding this issue. It looks like one of us wrote that description a long time ago and forgot to fix it. I'll update it now and you are correct that the input is supposed to be SI U-Value (W/m2K). I should also add that the input U-Value is supposed to include the resistance of air films on either side of the window as defined by NFRC.\n\nGenerally speaking, when people refer generically to \"U-Value\" they mean the winter U-Value because the U-Value typically has a much larger impact on heating energy use than cooling energy use. So I would use the winter U-Value if you have it but, otherwise, the summer U-Value is really not that different from the winter one (typically a 3% difference in my experience) and you can just use the summer one.\n\nFinally, if you need a really accurate simulation and have the exact manufacturer spec for your glazing in LBNL WINDOW, you can use the \"Honeybee_Import WINDOW IDF report component to use this in your simulations.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 12, 2017 at 04:53AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1795066", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1797528"}
