{"body": "\nHej guys,\n\n\n\nI have managed last night to go through it again without crashing - it took two hours - i got a 17 kwh/sqm/year - which is too good to be true - but somehow it makes sense - I have to double check again. I will check also your version later today when I am getting back to the drawing board. I am trying to model up a building based on defining each zone and then playing with their location within the building - to get there I need to fully understand the basic of the software - and while I am learning I thought why not use the building form I already have and I need to complete for my thesis - that is why I started with the big oval building. I attached the definition that worked. \u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/2lIhFeoR70A4FoAxMU6z5v2IMsDSwpDsdHX-mssDnmkgaK*0T0BXWSPCM8gDSMVOkVTVCAex2oRhRQeyR9kz7uR3y-HaKs51/definition2.jpg?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/2lIhFeoR70A4FoAxMU6z5v2IMsDSwpDsdHX-mssDnmkgaK*0T0BXWSPCM8gDSMVOkVTVCAex2oRhRQeyR9kz7uR3y-HaKs51/definition2.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1471086", "name": "mass site 3.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Stefania Dinea", "created_at": "February 25, 2016 at 02:43AM", "created_by": "StefaniaDinea", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1470987", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1471084"}
