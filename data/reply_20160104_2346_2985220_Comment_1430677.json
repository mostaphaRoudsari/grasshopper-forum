{"body": "\nHello again!\n\n\n\nFollowing Chris's advice I skimmed through the E+ reference guide. Took a lot of notes and learned a lot of interesting things I did not know. Unfortunately, the most difficult parts of the guide for me were exactly the two group of objects that are most interesting for this: EMS and ExternalInterface.\n\n\n\nI will keep reading and testing, currently also downloading BCVTB at work. I am also currently contacting two former colleagues one with a very strong background in ABM and coding and the other researching on building energy simulation. Will probe to see if this is interesting to them and will let you know.<br/><br/>Maybe we can coordinate something in the immediate future.\n\n\n\nHave a nice day.\n\n\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 04, 2016 at 11:46PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1414654", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1430677"}
