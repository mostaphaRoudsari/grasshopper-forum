{"body": "\nHi Alessandro,\n\n\n\nSee the images below. The idea is to run the analysis on the original image and then overlay the results of that analysis on an image with lower exposure.Hi Alessandro, I was able to make this work but not in Honeybee. Let's wait for Mostapha or Chris to reply on this.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/XlWIySAJgQgKGj7HHao1HvDJRhaVvi5KvWaywDkmP5n78aiyW4onr3pcOfSsXM2QFbSueuLHwhwq9OGcq4uC4YC5cVFQV7v4/Normal.bmp\" width=\"608\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/XlWIySAJgQgKGj7HHao1HvDJRhaVvi5KvWaywDkmP5n78aiyW4onr3pcOfSsXM2QFbSueuLHwhwq9OGcq4uC4YC5cVFQV7v4/Normal.bmp)[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/XlWIySAJgQgLcy-BiSEBZxoy3IUZiwXLjoqL-ArkpVkSVDU1O96MzixyzmNIOoBl9nTL5OmoUJK0JWivrSyOzTsnSt2kG8sr/LowExposure.bmp\" width=\"608\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/XlWIySAJgQgLcy-BiSEBZxoy3IUZiwXLjoqL-ArkpVkSVDU1O96MzixyzmNIOoBl9nTL5OmoUJK0JWivrSyOzTsnSt2kG8sr/LowExposure.bmp)\n\nSecondly, the DPI/resolution of the image can be improved by setting higher values for imageWidth and imageHeight in analysisRecipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n@Mostapha/Chris: Falsecolor2 doesn't seem to support overlaying contours on a different image as per [https://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/falsecolor2](https://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/falsecolor2). The way that I made this work was to use the falsecolor.pl that ships with Radiance. However, making that work with honeybee would require Perl to be installed. Do you guys currently require Perl as a dependency? Or maybe, there is a much simpler workaround than what I am suggesting !\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "December 4, 2015 at 3:45pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1415036", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1415065"}
