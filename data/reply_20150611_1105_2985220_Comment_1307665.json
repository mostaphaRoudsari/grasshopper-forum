{"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\n\n\nEnergyPlus offers three different mathematical algorithms for the calculation of the electricity produced by a PV module. The three different algorithms are equivalent to the three objects: simple, equivalent one-diode and Sandia and differ in the prediction accuracy.\n\n\n\nWhich model did you use in the component?\n\n\n\nThanks!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Let\u00edcia Niero Moraes", "created_at": "June 11, 2015 at 11:05AM", "created_by": "LeticiaNieroMoraes", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1307267", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1307665"}
