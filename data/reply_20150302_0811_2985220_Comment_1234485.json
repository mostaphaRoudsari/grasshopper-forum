{"body": "\nHello Chris,\n\nThank you very much for your answer. It seems clear to me that it\u2019s somehow possible to achieve at least the comfort of a person standing on the target area. Surface temperature I\u2019ll check that later.\n\nAbout the process you propose, I have some questions. I did start the radiance simulation as you described. From there I can get all the cumulative radiation values as KWh/m2. As a grid and also as an image (grid based analysis recipe and image based analysis recipe)\n\nI\u2019ll keep working on this\n\nThank you very much for your help and time. You guys are awesome.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCheers\n\nClaudio\n\nps: you'll find my definition as it is right now.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1234486", "name": "radiationtest-001.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "March 02, 2015 at 08:11AM", "created_by": "Claudio", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1233882", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1234485"}
