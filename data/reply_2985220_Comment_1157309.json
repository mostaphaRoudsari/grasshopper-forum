{"body": "\nHi TK,\n\nI know why this issue happens because I have seen some students have it. \u00a0It results from the fact that earlier versions of Rhino 5 (from service release 1-5) had some bugs that would cause the program to crash if Grasshopper did anything that was too computationally intensive. \u00a0In order to fix the problem, you need to update to the most recent service release of Rhino and most recent grasshopper (or at least to SR5 of Rhino). \u00a0For some people, this update was not possible on their machines but, in those cases, I have found that the 90-day free trial version of Rhino (or the very awesome educational discounted Rhino) usually does the trick.\n\nSince I know that you are in a bind, here is a rhino file with a Brisbane psych chart in it.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1157511", "name": "Psych Chart for TK.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 28, 2014 at 6:30pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1157480", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1157309"}
