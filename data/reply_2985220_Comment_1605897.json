{"body": "\nThere may be an alternative to using Radiance for the ASE calculations.\n\n\n\nbut since ASE doesnt need bounces of diffuse light, why don't anyone use the SunPath's SunVectors per hour and MeshRay or Occlusion to see, precisely, when different points in the grid are hit by the sun. I mean, in most cases, if there is direct sun, then it would be &gt;1000 lux, if LT is not super low. As an extra, the solarIrradiation from the EPW file could tell what the direct-normal irradiation is.\n\n\n\nIf this could be set up in a multi thread workflow, it might be feasible ?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mathias s n", "created_at": "September 26, 2016 at 11:17am", "created_by": "Mathiassn", "parent_id": "topic_1400028", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1605897"}
