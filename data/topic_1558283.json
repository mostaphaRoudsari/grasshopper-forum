{"body": "\nHi everybody,\n\nI am trying to use the PV components and\u00a0till this moment i had\u00a0few issues: at the beginning i had an old version installed in the laptop, then the Update components of Ladybug and Honeybee were not updating the file and all the components... and now the latest error\u00a0I get from RunEnergySimulation component \u00a0is:\n\n**1. It has been detected that there are PV generators attached to sufaces of a Honeybee zone.\u00a0****\u00a0However this Honeybee zone has not been connected to the _HBZones input on this component.\u00a0****\u00a0Please connect it to run the EnergyPlus simulation!**\n\nI don\u00b4t understand why I receive this error because I have the\u00a0_HBZones input connected with the HBZones output from SetEnergyPlus Zone Schedules.\n\nWhat is wrong? Any suggestion?\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudia", "created_at": "June 30, 2016 at 10:09am", "created_by": "Claudia598", "topic": "PV issues", "id": "topic_1558283"}
