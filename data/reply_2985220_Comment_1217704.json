{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Theodore,\n\nGlad to hear that you are interested in testing the new comfort tools. \u00a0I am just wrapping up the development phase now (I literally just have two features left to add and then it's all good for testing). I can post an example file here once I get it there (it should be today or tomorrow).\n\nAfter struggling with the splitBuildingMasses component for over a month, I realized that it is impossible to write something that is always going to work, especially when Rhino is a surface-based 3D modeler and not a volume or solid-based modeler (I discovered bugs in Rhino during the process of trying to make that component). \u00a0This discussion explains this a bit more about the difficulty:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/honeybee-ho...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/honeybee-honeybee-intersect-masses-is-removing-the-centroid-of-my?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1159978&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\n\nThe\u00a0splitBuildingMasses component is just meant to help you get your building divided as best as a script can but it's not always going to work and you will always need to take it the rest of the way if your geometry is complex. \u00a0And, in the video on splitBuildingMasses, I show you a complex geometry that fails to generate all zones but gives you enough for you to fill in the rest:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DClON71RuuA&amp;index=11&amp;list=P...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DClON71RuuA&amp;index=11&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_)\n\nI hope that clarifies everything,\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 5, 2015 at 8:37am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1216865", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1217704"}
