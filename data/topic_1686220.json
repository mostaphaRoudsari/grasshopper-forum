{"body": "\nI am trying to visualise the zone cooling loads for a structure, 5 floors at a time (since for some reason, Rhino would crash if i create additional floors and assign windows).\n\n\n\nAnyways, **the Colour Zones by EP result component would not output anything once i connect cooling load from the read EP result component**.\u00a0\n\nI have attached my GH file.\n\nP.S: you need to toggle True for many components. Also, materials assigned need to be updated every time the file is opened the file by double-clicking on the corresponding text boxes to the material creating components (again, not sure why, but i think that's unimportant)\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nHere is a screenshot of outputs from Write EPW and Write OSM files (with same inputs). As you can see the output from the two components vary. the OSM component seems to only give out the last result in the\u00a0case of Cooling loads.\u00a0[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KIUhBV3mdZ-XKaNn1Cc5O0Z9e2UALBsf8Kk48a4m2ZHZ44PBMKwpiHKivLrTCZbpBmnRAzH3mUlZFKrMG71YRbLQcBUGSgKY/OSM_error.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KIUhBV3mdZ-XKaNn1Cc5O0Z9e2UALBsf8Kk48a4m2ZHZ44PBMKwpiHKivLrTCZbpBmnRAzH3mUlZFKrMG71YRbLQcBUGSgKY/OSM_error.jpg)[<br/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KIUhBV3mdZ9t2GW8Ho6PUsxlU9N2bEWoD6gvo4OTjlQOsEyivVQtDBEZGwSr68iuRUdLJgXICUDcE02K*GEPSV-Bo4D9naVp/OSM_error.jpg)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1686219", "name": "20170206_OSM_v2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "nishant pandav", "created_at": "February 6, 2017 at 12:07pm", "created_by": "nishantpandav", "topic": "Unable to visualise Cooling load Zone data from Open Source", "id": "topic_1686220"}
