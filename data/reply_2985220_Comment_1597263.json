{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThank you for the reply. Due to the large number of discussions if there is anything that Chris and I need to have a look it's more reliable to post them on github. I'm not sure if Chris has seen your comment. I wish ning had the feature to mention names similar to github, twitter, etc.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 11, 2016 at 9:40am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1590843", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1597263"}
