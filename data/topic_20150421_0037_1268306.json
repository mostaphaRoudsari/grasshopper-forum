{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI am trying to assess view out in a project using the Ladybug View rose. I need to check over the plan of my project from which points one can see out. The problem is that I need to rule out views that go through more than two glasses. I cannot think of a way to adapt the script to that rule. Any suggestions?\n\nAle\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "April 21, 2015 at 12:37AM", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "topic": "View out excluding views though more than 2 glass panes", "id": "topic_1268306"}
