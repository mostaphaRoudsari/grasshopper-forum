{"body": "\nHey guys,\n\nI am trying to create a shading mask on surface for some bus stop shading devices and I have tried so much but I could not get any result. Every time I put the context into shading mask and shading mask II it will took a long time and grasshopper would crash and would error not responding. I don't know why because I do not have a complicated model. It is just a simple bus stop. It is not like a error message that will be show on. Grasshopper will stop working and will be not responding. Does anybody have any idea what might be the problem? I attached my gh and my rhino file so you can better understand the problem.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1638929", "name": "4'.3dm"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1638930", "name": "maskshadow.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mitra Sajjadi", "created_at": "November 13, 2016 at 9:12pm", "created_by": "MitraSajjadi", "topic": "Shading Mask Component does not run!!!", "id": "topic_1638931"}
