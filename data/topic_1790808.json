{"body": "\nHi,\n\nOne student of mine is having the following problem:\n\n1. You are not connected to the internet and you do not have the weather files already on your computer. You must be connected to the internet to download the files with this component.<br/> SystemError('Unable to connect to the remote server',)\n\nIt appears, of course, when trying to download a weather file. But the connection issue also appear when trying to use the update component.\n\nWe tried to change the default path to different locations in the computer, but no help.\n\nThe machine is connected to the internet (just in case you are asking).\n\nStrange thing is that on the same computer, months ago, the process worked (she has succeeded downloading EPW to default location).\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 30, 2017 at 9:54pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "topic": "[Solved] Issue: You are not connected to the internet and you do not have the weather files ...", "id": "topic_1790808"}
