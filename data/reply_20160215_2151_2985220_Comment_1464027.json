{"body": "\nHi Fredrico,\n\n\n\nHoneybee doesn't support Photon Mapping at present. The functionality of Radiance that is implemented in Honeybee right now is capable of handling most materials including multi-modifier complex materials.\n\n\u00a0I have done some fairly extensive testing with Photon Mapping outside of Honeybee and found that it's mostly useful if you are trying to simulate caustics. As per what I have last seen, Dr. Roland Schregle and his colleagues are still working on a variant of Photon Mapping that can be used for annual daylighting simulations.\n\n\n\nWhich materials are you trying to simulate?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "February 15, 2016 at 09:51PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1463708", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1464027"}
