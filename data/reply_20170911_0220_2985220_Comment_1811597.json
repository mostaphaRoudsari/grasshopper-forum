{"body": "\nHello Chris,\n\n\n\nThanks for your help so far, if possible I would like to get your thoughts and those of the community on few more errors I get when running the simulation.\n\nThe simulation concludes correctly and results seem to make sense; however I get the following error that I have never seen before:\n\n\n\n**The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error:** <br/> **** Severe ** Temperature (high) out of bounds (272.45] for zone=\"FRONT_ZONE\", for surface=\"E75D3CEDA5DC4B80A14F_GLZP_29\"**\n\n\n\nThis happens when I change the weather data to use the one from Bangkok (so, I much warmer climate compared to London).\n\n\n\nThere are also the following two errors:\n\n\n\n**The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error:**\n\n**** Severe ** Problem in interior solar distribution calculation (CHKBKS)**\n\n\n\n**The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error:** <br/> **** Severe ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 1 surfaces which are casting surfaces and are non-convex.**\n\n\n\nI know from previous discussions on the forum that the two errors above are actually not severe and I remember you explained what they refer to.\n\nYou were mentioning that the temperature of the surfaces would not be accurate. Does this mean that I may get not accurate results if I want to assess the thermal confort in one of the zones, for example the one close to the glass facade?\n\nDo you think this errors will be fixed at some point in future versions of HB?\n\nIs the only way to fix them to make my geometry composed of planar surfaces? I don't have L-shaped zones in the model.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nCarmelo\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carmelo G.
