{"body": "\nHi Tasos,\n\nWhat i'm saying is that the AirWall E+ material definition is not good for radiance simulations (in this case your daylight tests). For this, you need to define RADMaterials. But this is not going to help anyway becouse those are two different definitions. In this sense your figures are misleading you, even though the conclusion is correct.\n\nFrom what i checked this morning you are assigning the same E+ materials (or constructions) to all the surfaces (walls, floors, etc). So that's why in my opinion you need to decompose the zones in their surfaces to enable the assignment of different materials.\n\nI don't know how much time you have to get this done, but if you have some, i would start with a simple case of, maybe, two floors (zones), where you can be sure the materials assignment is what you expect the to be.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "March 11, 2015 at 8:07am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240299", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240308"}
