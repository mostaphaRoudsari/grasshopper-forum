{"body": "\nHi all [too keep it simple! ;)]\n\nDaniel,\n\n1. I closed that issue. Can you please check the updated component? It should always work.\n\n2. If you are using a button it should work fine. It's hard to know why is it happening unless I can reproduce it on my system\n\n\n\nAbraham, I think we should have one for sure. What about a lookUp component for energy simulation? It can be very similar to the one that is available for daylighting. Probably making couple of changes to the component will make it happen.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 8, 2015 at 10:10pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1220665", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1220803"}
