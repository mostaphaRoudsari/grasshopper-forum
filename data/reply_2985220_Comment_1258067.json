{"body": "\nAmy,\n\nI will admit that I am not sure exactly what you are talking about. \u00a0Do you mean surface temperature? \u00a0If so, you want to run a Honeybee energy simulation and use the Color Surfaces with EP Result component with surface temperature as your srfData.\n\nIf you are interested not in the temperature of a surface but the temperature that a person feels at a given set of points in space, you want something similar to the comfort maps that I have been working on for my thesis.\n\nExample file:\n\n[https://app.box.com/s/11abiyglfuaigd3tay85hqtbzi2iymue](https://app.box.com/s/11abiyglfuaigd3tay85hqtbzi2iymue)\n\nPresentation:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ami1gift3cz2etb/ComfortMap%20Presentation...](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ami1gift3cz2etb/ComfortMap%20Presentation.pdf?dl=0)\n\nConceptual Image:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/JeioNtmyO2ZpPLqSbn2eIpuEsXcDPnjSIqgdJjJYFtiLyr6abpzMcHlN2uaNbqLC03ErKgC0eIoY87JwWKcaDLkF5-1HK*XK/ComfortMap_Page_07.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/JeioNtmyO2ZpPLqSbn2eIpuEsXcDPnjSIqgdJjJYFtiLyr6abpzMcHlN2uaNbqLC03ErKgC0eIoY87JwWKcaDLkF5-1HK*XK/ComfortMap_Page_07.png)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "April 7, 2015 at 8:50am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1258036", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1258067"}
