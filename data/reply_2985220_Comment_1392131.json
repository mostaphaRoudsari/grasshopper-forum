{"body": "\nThis is an interesting problem.\n\nAs long as you don't consider reflections, (I think) you can calculate long-wave and short-wave using LB/HB with the Gencumulativesky module.It is probably easier to do with grid points than it is with an image based simulation. You can separate the radiation reaching a point into long-wave and short-wave based on the spectral power distribution of the solar spectrum. I am attaching an image below. This is also available in a Tabular format in Table 1.3.1a in Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes by Duffie (4th Ed).\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Solar_Spectrum.png\"/>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Solar_Spectrum.png)\n\nThe area under the curve represents the total radiation. You can derive long-wave and short-wave components by multiplying the total radiation with the weighting factors corresponding to each component.\n\n(PS: Please cross-check with some scholarly articles before finalizing such an approach for any project/research)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "November 3, 2015 at 9:49pm", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1391376", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1392131"}
