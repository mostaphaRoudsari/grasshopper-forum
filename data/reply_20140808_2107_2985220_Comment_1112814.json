{"body": "\nHi Alejandro,\n\nSimilar to other questions about EnergyPlus components it is because version mismatch.\n\nIf you update all the components then it will work fine. We will add an extra check to all the components to avoid similar issue. Check the attached file.\n\nYou are also making some mistakes in the way you are preparing the model. Check the attached file for a fixed version.\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1112816", "name": "honeybee_runtimeerror_msr.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "August 08, 2014 at 09:07PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1112490", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1112814"}
