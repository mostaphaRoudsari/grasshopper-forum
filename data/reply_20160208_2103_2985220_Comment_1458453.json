{"body": "\nSebastian,\n\nI apologize for the late reply. The default ideal air system template includes an air side economizer, which will mix in more outdoor air to the supply stream when the zone needs to be cooled AND the outdoor air is cooler than the room air temperature. \u00a0I put in this feature because most HVAC systems these days have an airside economizer to save energy. \u00a0You can turn off the airside economizer by setting the airsideEconomizer input on the \"Set Ideal Air Loads Parameters\" to False as I you see below and in the attached GH file.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/DMNc-KMuV*nDh0e8FQbgPROOfVmkXTH0KUxAwP06mB79FgJ9rbilgwaBhQZcvKZu1B77J6X0gSDGgeQ*gsDNnuR7p*S151EL/NoEconomizer.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/DMNc-KMuV*nDh0e8FQbgPROOfVmkXTH0KUxAwP06mB79FgJ9rbilgwaBhQZcvKZu1B77J6X0gSDGgeQ*gsDNnuR7p*S151EL/NoEconomizer.JPG)\n\nNote that your previously unexplained summertime airflow disappears and your cooling load increases because you are using electricity and your cooling coil to cool your zone instead of the cool outdoor air.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1458455", "name": "ventilation_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 08, 2016 at 09:03PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1457192", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1458453"}
