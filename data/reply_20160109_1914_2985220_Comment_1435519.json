{"body": "\nHi Geof,\n\nThere are two separate topics here:\n\n1. How is it possible that using 8 CPUs take longer than 4 CPUs?\n\nWell this is possible if you know how Radiance really works. I remember that Rob wrote\u00a0[a very nice short post about this](http://www.rumblestrip.org/2009/12/18/i-dont-get-it/)\u00a0which I can't find right now. I will ask him and if he couldn't find the link then I will rewrite it here. What you're doing is the right approach to find the optimum number of CPU's for your case.\n\n\n\n2. Why running the same analysis for the second time with Daysim takes much longer than the first time?\n\nWell, this should not happen. I have been told about this another time too but I couldn't recreate the issue. I will test your file and let you know the results. This is something that we can definitely fix.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 09, 2016 at 07:14PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1435391", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1435519"}
