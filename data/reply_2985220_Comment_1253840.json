{"body": "\nHi Lu,\n\nSorry for replying so late. \u00a0The most recent version of Honeybee on the github has fully functioning air walls. \u00a0Air walls allow you to break up open space into individual zones while still keeping an open floor plan. \u00a0Specifically, air walls will use a very thin construction (essentially just an air film) and also mix the air in between adjacent zones in order to have a more consistent temperature. \u00a0Also, by default, air walls are automatically removed from the daylight simulation. \u00a0Attached you can find your GH file using air walls for adjacencies.\n\n\n\nAs for he skylight breakup dist, I have now included a separate input for this that is different than the breakup dist of the walls. \u00a0You can get the new component in the attached file or by syncing with the github.\n\n\n\nLastly, your zones in the base model were not closed so I closed them for you.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1253841", "name": "basemode1_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 31, 2015 at 4:54pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1247170", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1253840"}
