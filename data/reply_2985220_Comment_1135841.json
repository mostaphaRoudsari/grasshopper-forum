{"body": "\nHi Giuseppe,\n\nI see your point. You are right. We don't really have a clean way of doing this. Maybe we should add a component to let the user change glazing materials for either a HBSrf or a HBZone.\n\nFor now you can generate the surface by component decompose the brep, regenrate HBSurfaces and run the analysis. Not a clean methodology at all but it should work until I add the component that I mentioned.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/26rh2i2B5Mb3WDSTRVjepOAnC-eMOTDqb1j-QpJu5G4xqowv3c-42kjGAfqeI2rk8llpHfJhxLaNZWH2vL8Zgg9xDeGAe453/changeGlazingMaterial.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/26rh2i2B5Mb3WDSTRVjepOAnC-eMOTDqb1j-QpJu5G4xqowv3c-42kjGAfqeI2rk8llpHfJhxLaNZWH2vL8Zgg9xDeGAe453/changeGlazingMaterial.png)\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1135842", "name": "changeGlazingMaterial.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 22, 2014 at 7:33pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1135843", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1135841"}
