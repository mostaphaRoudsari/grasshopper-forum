{"body": "\nHi Everybody,\n\nI tried to construct a very simple energy model for my exercise, unfortunately I did not succeed E+ simulation with honeybee. When I ran the simulation it said:\n\n\"1. The simulation has not run correctly because of this severe error: <br/> ** Severe ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 2 surfaces which are casting surfaces and are non-convex.<br/>\"\n\nI don't really understand what it tried to tell me. I am assuming that there is something wrong with my honeybee model. Could anyone help me please!\n\n\n\nPlease find an attachment of my Grasshopper file.\n\n\n\n[](http://api.ning.com:80/files/A22HvZ-IoXUiiUdyPqRgaklmHNS7uh7y2TSpFxUiQzR1XK-X0JDb61OmroI9o4KYB0P2sgQbqDfo9q0BHvDnMmFmkvFs7MEV/ENERGYMODEL.gh)<br/>Atta\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1569016", "name": "ENERGY MODEL.gh"}], "created_by_name": "atthaillah b", "created_at": "July 20, 2016 at 05:05AM", "created_by": "atthaillahb", "topic": "Honeybee Energy Model Problem", "id": "topic_1569017"}
