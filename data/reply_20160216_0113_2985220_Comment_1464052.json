{"body": "Hi Abraham, Mostapha,\nReally interesting topic indeed. Mostapha in one (of the many) discussions out there we had discussed about the LB_LB component and the path it reads the libraries from. I have been using flux to run \"cloud\" e+ simulations in multiple desktops but had issues with DL simulations as a batch file is not enough to do so. I have the feeling - need to test - that with these components and an option to assign a path to LB_LB to read the libraries from different directories than the local \"c:\\ladubug\" that usually does now so we can host them on a shared file on a server all sort of analyses will be possible in multiple machines even with custom materials schedules etc. This would be simply taking things to another level! Great work again!\n\nP.s these components will be significantly useful for free form structures and other special geomtries that tend to push the limits of GH, cpu, ram and myself s during set up! thanks a lot\n\nTasos", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 16, 2016 at 01:13AM", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1464606", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1464052"}
