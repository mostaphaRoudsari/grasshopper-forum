{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\nIt seems like a lot of what you might want to do can be done with native grasshopper components that can calculate the areas of your window breps (if you have them on one layer) and compare them with the areas of your walls (if you have them on another layer).\n\nIf you get the geometry into HBZone format, there is a lot of ways that you can separate the zones (based on orientation or perimeter/core). \u00a0Check out the components in the drop-down of the first Honeybee tab and you may find some useful stuff to help you. \u00a0You can then use separated zones and run them through different Set EP Zone Construction components if you want to separately change the properties of windows for different cardinal directions.\n\nLet me know if that is clear or if you would need more specific examples.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 05, 2015 at 06:18PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1217630", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1218998"}
