{"body": "\nGood catch, Alejando.\n\nMy description still had a bunch of mistakes in it. \u00a0I have just uploaded a version to the github with the following descriptions:\n\n\n\nventilationPerArea_: The desired minimum rate of ventilation through the mechanical system into the zone per square meter of floor. Values here should be in m3/s-m2 (Cubic meters per second per square meter of floor). Often, this total value over the zone should be much lower than the ventilation per person (below). Typical values can range from 0.0002 m3/s-m2 for lightly-occupied houses to 0.0025 m3/s-m2 for spaces like laboratories and cleanrooms where dust contamination is a major concern.\n\n<br/> ventilationPerPerson_: The desired minimum rate of ventilation through the mechanical system into the zone per person in the zone. Values here should be in m3/s-person (Liters per second per person in the zone). In effect, an input here will mimic demand controlled ventilation, where the ventilation through the mechanical system will change depending upon the occupancy. Most standards suggest that you should have at least 0.001 m3/s for each person in the zone but this may be increased sometimes to avoid odors or exposure to indoor pollutants.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 17, 2014 at 11:50AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1170281", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1170464"}
