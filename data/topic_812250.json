{"body": "\nHi\u00a0Mostapha,<br/><br/>Looks like I'll be doing some environmental solar analysis on a project, so I thought that I would give your tools a try. I just checked out the videos and they look very impressive! Really cool of you to provide the whole thing as open sourced Python components.\u00a0Congrats on a great job :)<br/><br/>I just have a few questions about preparing the input geometry for analysis. In my\u00a0case study\u00a0I think I shall mainly be using the**\u00a0\"Ladybug_Sunlight Hours Analysis\"** and\u00a0**\"Ladybug_Radiation Analysis\"** components to drive the\u00a0geometry\u00a0of a shading system. I apologize if these questions are obvious or have already been answered (I did check out the previous posts beforehand):<br/><br/>\n\n1) Units, which would be the best modelling unit to work with (I assume Meter, but you never know)?<br/><br/>2) Model, I can use either Brep or Mesh as input. But if I want explicit control over the grid size/analysis faces I guess I should use a mesh right?<br/><br/>3) Mesh, if one only wants to analyse a specific part of the building envelope, would it make sense to have the rest of the envelope be \"context\"?<br/><br/>4) Mesh, is the analysis only performed on the front mesh faces (the side where the normals are pointing)?<br/><br/>5) Mesh, would it make sense to have each glass pane be a quad face (I assume the test points correspond to either mesh vertices or face centers)?<br/><br/>Hope this makes any sense, I'm a bit new to the whole \"environmental analysis\" world. Be gentle :)<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Anders\n\n\n\n<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<br/><br/>\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anders Holden Deleuran", "created_at": "March 19, 2013 at 4:31am", "created_by": "AndersHoldenDeleuran", "topic": "Best Practices for Input Model Geometry.", "id": "topic_812250"}
