{"body": "\nHi Jack,\n\nSince Mostapha's suggestions are now working for you (and he is on the road) i would suggest two things: Upload the file in question (with internalised data) and/or check backwards the components to see where the process is failing. I suspect that even the HDR image was not created (from your images it's not possible to say).\n\nIn general i think is always better to attach the file so the advice can be more productive and fast.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "May 26, 2014 at 10:41PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1078643", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1078591"}
