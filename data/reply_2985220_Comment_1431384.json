{"body": "\nOK. I've been checking a bit the viewAnalysis regarding the SVF.\n\nThe results vary a bit from those of the LB_shadingMask (1-2%), which a see a s good consistency. This is great. I can say that the VSC doesn't show a good agreement with this SVF, so even though the logic can be similar they don't converge.\n\n\n\nFor consistency between the viewAnalysis and shadingMask the viewResolution_ and the _skyDensity_ inputs, accordingly, represent the same resolution value? The first part of the description says so, but just want to be sure. Maybe the input name can be similar (i assume that viewRessolution applies only to SVF analysis)?\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 6, 2016 at 12:53am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1431206", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1431384"}
