{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI'm checking the version of LB_viewAnalysis you released today. I see the option of SVF (great).\n\nIn the process the component gives an error (red component) regarding the viewPtsWeights missing (line 526). I solved it temporary changing the variable name for \"1\". I see that this variable shows in some other places as a parameter but not as a variable influencing the calculations. So i assume it can be deleted from the component.\n\n\n\nI'll keep checking and will report results here.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "January 05, 2016 at 10:09PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1380105", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1431206"}
