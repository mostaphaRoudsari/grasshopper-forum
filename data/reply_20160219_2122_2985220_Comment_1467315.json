{"body": "\nThanks Chris.\n\nThis is good.\n\nThe second question (half wall adiabatic, and half air wall) regarding the recommendation for modeling was not understood as i intended. See attached. The idea is half of each internal wall to have different boundary conditions. So the question i there is a way to do that with this masses modeling or should i do that with surface by surface (which i'm afraid is the way).\n\nThanks!!\n\n-A.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Arj-j*1Gcz1t0fG*Q9u*bfJArOv2zJ6r0fwoMQIHcaCJg3ulMg3UYruabiviQ5FiyuSBSoFze1UHINwzx78If*1J-7yxT23o/20160220_060758.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Arj-j*1Gcz1t0fG*Q9u*bfJArOv2zJ6r0fwoMQIHcaCJg3ulMg3UYruabiviQ5FiyuSBSoFze1UHINwzx78If*1J-7yxT23o/20160220_060758.png)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1467316", "name": "2016-02-20_06-07-58.png"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "February 19, 2016 at 09:22PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1466997", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1467315"}
