{"body": "\nArpan and Nick,\n\n\n\nAfter realizing that this could be an issue for many of us, I checked the lengthy GH file and found a bug in my \"Do Si Do\" method. \u00a0I got distracted by the quote\u00a0\"currently OpenStudio component cannot use .csv file as a schedule\" thinking that an older version of the component was being used since this warning does not exist in the current version. \u00a0The bug only affected cases where you had many CSV schedules all with the same Type Limits.\n\n\n\nI have fixed it as you can see here:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/9c229b2969da6e0...](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/commit/9c229b2969da6e0ede04befc2c2f846303c99e17)\n\n\n\nThe attached file runs without issues. \u00a0Thanks for reporting this, Arpan, and let me know, Nick, if you get the chance to try out the new Do Si Do method. \u00a0Your UL method is probably the most clever application of the UL library I have yet seen!\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1575901", "name": "EnergyModel_FIXED.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 03, 2016 at 01:29PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1576057", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1575900"}
