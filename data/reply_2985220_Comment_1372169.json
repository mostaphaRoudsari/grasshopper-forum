{"body": "\nChris hello,\n\nFor the sake of debugging, I turned on all the options in the \"Generate EP Output\" component in the GH script version you sent back. I also disconnected my external feed-in file that calls for even more variable outputs. (I also deleted out non-relevant stuff to make the script relevant to the current question).\n\n\n\nSo after eliminating any \"weirdness\" I could see, the component still throws an error. It occurred to me earlier that it might not be expecting the output from the OS component...rather that it was designed for the EP component, and there isn't likely a perfect correspondence between the IDFs and CSVs generated by the two (although you've done a noble job with it as far as I can tell). could this be an issue?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe error from the ReadEPSrfResult component is \"1. Solution exception:name 'duplicate' is not defined.\"\n\n\n\nIs this a name of an object in the python code? I opened up the code and found the first instance of \"duplicate\" at line 275:\n\n.........\n\n#Make a function to check the srf name and type Name.<br/>def checkSrfName(csvName, dataType):<br/> srfName = None<br/> duplicate = False\n\n.......\n\n\n\nDoes this definiton come from outside the component code (library, HB, etc...?) This is currently as far as my programming knowledge can take me(!)\n\n\n\nI re-attached my stripped down debugging GH script here if you want to take a look.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1372170", "name": "Xmas_5.3.1_CWM_2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Nick Novelli", "created_at": "October 2, 2015 at 7:12am", "created_by": "NickNovelli", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1372017", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1372169"}
