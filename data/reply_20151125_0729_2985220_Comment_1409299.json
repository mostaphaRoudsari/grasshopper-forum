{"body": "Abraham,\n\nThanks for taking care of this. We have realized that missing required inputs tend to be a big reason for a number of people's issues and so we are inputting a set of warnings in our next release that will alert people if they are missing something required:\nhttps://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/196#issuecomment...\n\nAs for the comfort components, I re-named the \"annual indoor microclimate analysis\" component to be called \"microclimate map analysis\" after I put in the ability to create maps of outdoor temperature with the same components (the word indoor seemed no longer relevant). I did this a few months ago and realize that changing the name can create confusion but know that the component you have in your image is just the most recent version of the old \"indoor microclimate analysis\" component.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 25, 2015 at 07:29AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1409117", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1409299"}
