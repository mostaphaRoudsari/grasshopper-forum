{"body": "\nHey Chris,\u00a0\n\nAt this point when I hear about addition of even more functionality to LB/HB I feel excited and always agree on it. However now that I'm trying to get a hang of HB I get frustrated by the sheer amount of components, they don't even fit when I maximize the window unless I pull the tab all the way down XD.\n\nAll I want to say is that I think that at some moment in the future you guys will have to think about integration of multiple components in one and \"prettyfication\", so the components are compact and nice looking (without all these underscores, dashes and spaces))\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love everything you do and understand that at this stage your (team) plugins are at pre-alpha state and need a lot of tuning and cleaning before they start to look something like native GH components.\n\nSometimes I'm itching to ask you guys:\"Hey, what's with all these blank inputs and outputs?\" My guess, is a temporary system that you came up with or limitations of python (doubt), correct me on this one.\n\nIn conclusion, add as a new component and maybe integrate it in sunpath with boolean toggle for accuracy later. More is better but not too much XD\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 10:24PM", "created_by": "Timur582", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462948", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1463246"}
