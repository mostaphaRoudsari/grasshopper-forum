{"body": "\nHi Lizzie,\n\n\n\nThere are two different topics in your your question. I answer the second one first.\n\nYou can manipulate the values by merging the lists of numbers and use Honeybee_Create CSV Schedule to write them to a file all inside Grasshopper.\n\n\n\nBack the first topic it uses Daysim to calculate the schedule and daysim doesn't accept partial occupancy so we have to convert the partial occupancy in EnergyPlus to zero and ones in Daysim. The good news is that you can manage the numbers as you wish by using the method that I mentioned earlier.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 29, 2016 at 06:56AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1472714", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1474037"}
