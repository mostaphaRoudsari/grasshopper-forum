{"body": "\nHi,\n\nThere are two issues here that explain why it is not working, as far as i checked.\n\n1. Where you define the material and construction for the window was not connected to the HB_setEPZoneCnstr component (see 3 in attached), so in theory, until you don't connect here it will use a default material (right Mostapha and Chris?) or the material you assigned previously (see 1 in attached).\n\n2. I updated many of the components to the last definitions, hoping this will help ... but it doesn't.\n\n3. This is the key one, where i think there is some kind of bug, or a big misunderstanding how to operate on my side. After connecting the new defined material to the setEPZoneCnstr (point 1 above), i was hoping this will be taken into account for the simulation. It isn't. I checked the IDF created and i see there that the construction material assigned for all windows is ExternalWindow, which i assume is the default. I see also that the defined materials and constructions are not included there. Maybe there is a problem with the SimpleGlazingSystem?\n\nIn short, you are receiving the same results simply because the materials are not changed in the simulation file.\n\nWill be glad to hear M and C explanations :-)\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1183588", "name": "shgcwindows_AY.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "December 08, 2014 at 10:42AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "topic_1183291", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183586"}
