{"body": "\nLeticia,\n\nAs of a few days ago there is! \u00a0Our awesome developer, Anton Szilasi, just spent the last 2-3 months building out the capability to run Energy simulations with PV panels and other energy generation objects. \u00a0It seems that you are the perfect candidate to beta test them. \u00a0I will warn that Anton is not going to be able to provide much beta-test support for the next week or so but, if you want to get a head start on checking out the capabilities, you can find an example file here:\n\n[https://app.box.com/s/70ztpo8xk31zuvxi7qbzcoqd2buioptv](https://app.box.com/s/70ztpo8xk31zuvxi7qbzcoqd2buioptv)\n\nYou can get all of the components in the file by syncing with the github.\n\n\n\nAnton also put together some tutorial videos, although he said that he's going to fix the sound on them soon:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNLhITrK1Ww&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNLhITrK1Ww&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=25)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFC9eQtaK2w&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFC9eQtaK2w&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=26)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQCJQBOR77M&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQCJQBOR77M&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_&amp;index=27)\n\n\n\nIf you send me an email, I can put you in touch with Anton so that he can help once he's available.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "June 10, 2015 at 06:51PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1306011", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1307153"}
