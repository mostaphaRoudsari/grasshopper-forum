When I open the IDF I see that the Schedule:file section is empty whilst I've set schedules to each zone using the setEP zone schedules component. I've also tried updating this component to the March 14th 2016 version from github but this has not been succesfull\n\nDo you have any ideas?\u00a0\n\n\n\nGr,\n\n\n\nSam\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/xXRIOreeuw2HujDaLyXSRtv0Ns1X1iwXGtwaEcanrDGSc4hiCrkEqkkrDBk4V*R7V1wgnLpc8uhEk*ezmPWoMfmklhTjUvrq/Schedulenameerror.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/xXRIOreeuw2HujDaLyXSRtv0Ns1X1iwXGtwaEcanrDGSc4hiCrkEqkkrDBk4V*R7V1wgnLpc8uhEk*ezmPWoMfmklhTjUvrq/Schedulenameerror.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Samuel de Vries", "created_at": "March 24, 2016 at 3:24pm", "created_by": "SamueldeVries", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1490267", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1491709"}
