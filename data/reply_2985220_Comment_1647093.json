{"body": "\nLadan,\n\nHere is an example for the whole process with four zones which I hope answer all of your questions that you have posted recently. I didn't run the analysis but you should be able to run it after adding the weather file and a couple of other components.\n\nBack to your question about picking the points you can either flatten all the points and then pick them using item selector or just pick them by grafting the numbers to match each branch. Try Point List component in Grasshopper to see the item number for each point.\n\nIn the attached example I used a logic to find the closest point to the center of the room.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1647095", "name": "integrated daylight and energy.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 27, 2016 at 5:52pm", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1646869", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1647093"}
