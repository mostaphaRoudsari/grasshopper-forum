{"body": "\nGreat work gentlemen!\n\nI just merged in your component, Djordje and I agree that the two different specialties of the APIs make it a good idea to support both components. \u00a0I just wanted to add that, if anyone wants to nerd-out all of the way and take a look at the raw data that supports both components you can find it all here:\n\n[http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/](http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/)\n\nOf course, this data is really unwieldy and the APIs that you guys are both using make A LOT more sense if you want to actually apply the data usefully.\n\nBoth components are going to make things a lot easier for a number of people. \u00a0My mind is already spinning with the possibilities of hydrology studies that we can run off of this easily-accessible topo data.\n\nKeep the great stuff coming!\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 26, 2016 at 8:33pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1588204", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1589161"}
