{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\n\n\nI tried importing from WINDOW with the new components of the new release and I get results in the right directions. My biggest question mark though was the actual modelling of the cushions in WINDOW as I couldn't find a direct way to model the ETFE layer itself. If you have any updates with this please let me know, I am highly interested :)\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nTasos\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "February 5, 2016 at 5:31am", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1454362", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1455344"}
