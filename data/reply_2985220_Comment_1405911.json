{"body": "\nHi Tasos,\n\nVery interesting! Happy to hear that you got it to work.\n\nI'm not sure if I understand the first part of the problem.\n\nI assume the issue with running daylighting simulations is absolute vs relative file path. This is an issue that can be addressed.\n\nShould we start a new discussion for both of your questions since they are not really related to this discussion and more importantly it will be easier for other users to follow the discussion and find the answers later.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 5:13pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1404586", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1405911"}
