{"body": "\nClaudia,\n\nYour issue is very clearly a geometry one and I can tell you precisely that it happens because your Honeybee Zone is not closed:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Pp9njAMWrxwxGZjIZjZks24PABJlEGQfeyN6QNxr*EHi5PzumeQgMLgn2w6nBk82pil4b2BAAkoCIfQUbWx-Dqqi2bGYsbKx/GeometryProblem.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Pp9njAMWrxwxGZjIZjZks24PABJlEGQfeyN6QNxr*EHi5PzumeQgMLgn2w6nBk82pil4b2BAAkoCIfQUbWx-Dqqi2bGYsbKx/GeometryProblem.JPG)\n\nZones must be closed volumes of air and so you can always tell if your model geometry is going to fail if your HBZone is not closed as you see in the image above. \u00a0An easy way to find the problem spots of your model is to bake the zone and do a DupBorder command and this will show you all of the holes of your model:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Pp9njAMWrxzlaiqzYZ3vtZqa559bnqA3X8OMdJ9j41v5W1ifwT1xJzVLlct26qb5vDTUZfH-Wwbzm3qe4wropM5T5PNHQytV/ModelHoles.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Pp9njAMWrxzlaiqzYZ3vtZqa559bnqA3X8OMdJ9j41v5W1ifwT1xJzVLlct26qb5vDTUZfH-Wwbzm3qe4wropM5T5PNHQytV/ModelHoles.JPG)\n\nIt looks like you had a lot of window surfaces that were not coplanar with the walls. I deleted these windows and retraced the walls so your model is running fine now (see attached gh file), although the hundreds of surfaces means that it takes an hour to run. \u00a0Anything that you can do to reduce the number of surfaces is going to help you a lot. \u00a0EnergyPlus is not a program that you can simply throw any geometry into. \u00a0Also, as a general note, EnergyPlus does not like it when you put window surfaces right up against the edge of the wall surface as you do here:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Pp9njAMWrxyyRmu1e2D6YQAsf8P3*Qs8HI6D2ISdGcR4jhXerXSE5BQeUKLVef9oI-9lvxy7WY0xRF5LZD3VCx*hRtm3RDsC/Glazingatedges.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Pp9njAMWrxyyRmu1e2D6YQAsf8P3*Qs8HI6D2ISdGcR4jhXerXSE5BQeUKLVef9oI-9lvxy7WY0xRF5LZD3VCx*hRtm3RDsC/Glazingatedges.JPG)\n\nYou have to leave some room between the window and the wall edge.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1421610", "name": "Floor_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 14, 2015 at 08:07PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1420995", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1421308"}
