{"body": "\nHi Theodore,\n\nGlad to hear that you are trying out the tools. \u00a0It would be good to know more specifics about when the view factor component is causing your GH to freeze. \u00a0The component generates a preview of the mesh that it is going to calculate view factors for before you set runIt to true (since actually calculating the view factors is a computationally-intensive process that took 15 seconds to run in parallel for that small test box above - more like a minute for non-parallel). \u00a0Are you saying that the component is causing your GH to freeze even before you have plugged HBZones into it? \u00a0If that is true, I am pretty stumped as to what the issue is. \u00a0Otherwise, I would set a very large gridsize before you plug in your HBZones.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 6, 2015 at 7:25am", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1219521", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1219628"}
