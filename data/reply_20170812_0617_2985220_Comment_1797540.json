{"body": "\nDavid,\n\nI am not sure if I am understanding your question but energyplus is running an energy balance calculation that accounts for all of the terms that you see in this chart:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Energy_Balance&amp;slide=1&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for output heating and cooling in units of electricity/fuel rather than heating/cooling load, I suggest that you run your modyl with a real HVAC system instead of the default ideal air loads as you see in this example file:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Calculate_Annual_Utility_Bill&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1&amp;offset=0,0)\n\nThis will likely be much more accurate than multiplying your ideal air loads by a COP.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 12, 2017 at 06:17AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1794416", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1797540"}
