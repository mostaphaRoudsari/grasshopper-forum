{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nI'm having a bit of a hard time understanding what is going on in your file but perhaps this is what you are noticing: \u00a0The view factor mesh component outputs meshes on a \"continuous air volume\" basis rather than a zone-by-zone basis. \u00a0So, if you have two zones that share an air wall, there will be one mesh output for both zones. \u00a0If there is a solid wall between zones, two separate meshes will be output.\n\nDoes this answer your question?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 1, 2016 at 5:23pm", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1650230", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1650275"}
