{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nI\u2019m Filippo, the colleague Letizia was talking about. First of all thank you very much for your work, you\u2019re all doing a great job in trying to let grasshopper and Energy plus work together.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs you can see in the attached file, I temporarily bypassed the construction and some of the schedule we made to use the custom library.idf that you suggested us, and \u00a0it works very well, (at the moment we\u2019re not going to run galapagos optimization on material thicknesses so for now we can wait for updates on that issue without any hurry).\n\n\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately I believe the problem lies for us not in the possibility to customize schedule and construction but in the default program that defines some strings in the idf file without the possibility to change/overwrite them: if we cannot create our own custom program or disable the program by default in some way (as Letizia said maybe creating a \u201cnone\u201d option in the Honeybee_bldprograms could do just fine) , we will continue to have in some places settings that are not good for our research (for example in the people internal gain where to one gain are attached several schedules and settings, and we need to fill the field of air velocity schedule name and the thermal comfort model with Adaptive CEN15251 to have Adaptive comfort output from the simulation).\n\n\n\nFilippo\n\n\n\np.s. great news you're coming to Rome!!!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1261821", "name": "HB_TEST_1304.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Filippo", "created_at": "April 13, 2015 at 3:17am", "created_by": "Filippo", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1260948", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1261819"}
