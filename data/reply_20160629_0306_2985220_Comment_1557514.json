{"body": "\nHi Tasos!\n\n\n\nI checked my task manager but E+ does not seem to run in the background. In fact the 'runIt_' boolean comes to True as soon as I hit it. The screen blinks for a few times and that's it. The 'Re-Run IDF' components shows .csv files being generated at their respective locations but are not actually getting generated. i am not sure why is this happening.\n\nRegards,\n\nRam\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ram Joshi", "created_at": "June 29, 2016 at 03:06AM", "created_by": "RamJoshi", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1557258", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1557514"}
