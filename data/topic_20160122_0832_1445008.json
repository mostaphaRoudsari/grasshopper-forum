{"body": "\nHi, everyone.\n\n\n\nIm trying to verify solar radiation of ground surface which is reflected from the other buildings with \"Run Daylight Simulation\" component and \"annualSimulation\" component.\n\n\n\nTo analyze reflected solar radiation, I wanna isolate direct radiation from total radiation.\n\n\n\nI tried to modify the epw file.\n\nI changed numerical values of Global Horizontal Radiation when there is no Diffuse Horizontal Radiation, and inputed zero into Diffuse Horizontal Radiation value.\n\nBut the result was all zero.\n\n\n\nI used following formula.\n\nGlobal Horizontal Radiation(Direct Horizontal Radiation) = Direct Normal Radiation*sin(solar altitude)\n\n\n\nPlease let me know how to evaluate only direct radiation.\n\n\n\nthanks.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "natchan", "created_at": "January 22, 2016 at 08:32AM", "created_by": "natchan", "topic": "How to evaluate direct radiation", "id": "topic_1445008"}
