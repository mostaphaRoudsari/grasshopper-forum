{"body": "\nHi Jesper!\n\nThank you! As I mentioned\u00a0[here](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/analysis-view-problem?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A853043&amp;groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987)\u00a0there are few bugs in the view component that should be fixed! I also have to write a post to discuss how the parameter component works. The result that you get though looks way wrong! That 0 values does make no sense to me. Are you using the locked version? I fixed the component once but only for the unlocked version.\n\nIf you still want to use the view component and cannot wait until I fix it all upload your definition so I can take a look.\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 19, 2013 at 9:07pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_856366", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_856550"}
