{"body": "\nHi Mostapha, Chris and group members,\n\n\n\n1. What's the difference between pv calculation functions in the renewable table of Ladybug and the generator system in Honeybee?\n\n\n\n2. I tend to make a parametric roof model with pv, to make a optimal choice of pv arrangement by the best renewable energy production optimization. How to make the shading and array tilt, density and orientation of the pv panels into consideration? As photovoltaics surface component can make the output of tilt angle , azimuth angle and AC energy per year, how to visualize the performance difference on the form?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vl6FuIcyK*tmW9TIWCL*BfC5uTmBVI1THsBJmoOiYev73QCZXyNO4jLTjYUb*I8gXqtIUFQ4or20iyT8Ftm0JoRKKDGSXYoA/Capturet.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Vl6FuIcyK*tmW9TIWCL*BfC5uTmBVI1THsBJmoOiYev73QCZXyNO4jLTjYUb*I8gXqtIUFQ4or20iyT8Ftm0JoRKKDGSXYoA/Capturet.png)\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "October 31, 2016 at 11:29PM", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "topic": "Renewable Energy Production Issue", "id": "topic_1629877"}
