{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\n\n\nIf I'm right, then you bake real text with the bake button and the previews are just meshes, right?\n\nI'm looking for a way to, on purpose, mesh a lot of text inputs for a faster and more responsive preview (when all the meshes are joined). Is there a line in Ladybug one can copy in order to \"Text2Mesh\" ?\n\n\n\nBest, Mathias\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mathias s n", "created_at": "January 06, 2017 at 07:38AM", "created_by": "Mathiassn", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1414370", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1667765"}
