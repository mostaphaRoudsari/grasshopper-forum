{"body": "\nHey Salad, Omid,\u00a0\n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with the script as its working perfectly fine for me (see img).\n\n\n\nSome questions:\n\n- What model units is your Rhino file set to? Should be in meters.\u00a0\n\n- Where is the origin cplane in your Rhino file, make sure it is as close as possible to your model\n\n- Can you make a simple box and see if the energy simulation works on that? That way we can rule out if there is a geometry issue causing this problem.\u00a0\n\n\n\nGive that a shot, and get back to us.\u00a0\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1618133", "name": "gh_bug.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Saeran Vasanthakumar", "created_at": "October 13, 2016 at 10:01am", "created_by": "SaeranVasanthakumar", "parent_id": "topic_1604721", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1618132"}
