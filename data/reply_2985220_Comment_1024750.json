{"body": "\nHi Petar,\n\nYou don't need to create a zone for this case (however you can). Just use createHBSrfs component and assign the materials to the surfaces (or leave the material input empty if you want to use generic materials). The same goes to the vertical wall.\n\nBack to the second question, you can generate the test points from any surface or mesh. All you need as the input is a list of points and vectors that indicates points direction.\n\nNevertheless, this looks like a great case that I can use to record a tutorial on how you can prepare a model with Honeybee for daylight simulation. If you provide more information here (such as the model itself and material properties) I can capture the video tomorrow evening and post it on YouTube.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "March 12, 2014 at 10:36am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "topic_1024838", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1024750"}
