{"body": "\nHi Francesco,<br/><br/>As it names says, the \"Thermal Comfort Indices\" covers a couple of thermal comfort indices. Some of them are dependent on solar radiation, meaning they require a particular HOY_ to be defined.<br/>So when you choose the \"PET\" index to be calculated, and when you supply a single value to each of the \"Thermal Comfort Indices\" inputs, the component still does not know for which particular hour do you want it to calculate the chosen index for.<br/>I replicated the same averaging method you used for other weather data to calculate the average HOY.<br/>You also forgot to supply the data to the \"analysisPeriod_\" of the \"Wind speed calculator\" component.<br/>As for the PET index taking longer to calculate than UTCI: it's because PET incrementally calculates the heat flow through convection, radiation, transpiration, skin wetness... for each PET value, while \"Outdoor Comfort Calcualtor\" component is using a pre-parameters defined version of UTCI.<br/><br/>I noticed that your area of analysis is situated in urban context with high buildings.<br/>Have in mind that in these kind of urban environments the air temperature from the airport (the weather file) might not be the same as the air temperature at your location. We still do not have the means to correct the airport one.<br/>I guess because the analysis is not meant to be actually used, but instead it's for academic purposes, you can use the airport air temperature.<br/><br/>Check the attached file.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1523962", "name": "PMVUTCIPET2.gh"}], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "May 6, 2016 at 12:28am", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "topic_1521933", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1523960"}
