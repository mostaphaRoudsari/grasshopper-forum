{"body": "\nChris thank you so much, and apologies for my novice attempts and messy files. Still getting used to how everything works. I do have one more question though.\n\nIn your videos you discuss the glazing by ratio component. For whatever reason, the breakUpDist_ plug isn't an option for me for that component as it is in your tutorial. Not sure why, I've tried updating the file and userobjects but it still doesn't show up. When I set \"breakUpWindow_\" to true the component goes red and tells me the breakUpDistance_ isn't defined. Which I thought was odd because the default is set to true. So the only way I can run the component is if I have the breakUpWindow_ set to false. Any idea why this is?\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/oJSI3sXfh3WKGZ4eoJjerQZWkS*Ef07bWGZZPT3lPIx*4*i0gUgLNW7l8CjXmeweZLKI1y5AXkMa5gzVryewvaWgBuju5gdM/Canvasat142041.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/oJSI3sXfh3WKGZ4eoJjerQZWkS*Ef07bWGZZPT3lPIx*4*i0gUgLNW7l8CjXmeweZLKI1y5AXkMa5gzVryewvaWgBuju5gdM/Canvasat142041.png)<br/>Again, endless amounts of thanks and appreciation.
