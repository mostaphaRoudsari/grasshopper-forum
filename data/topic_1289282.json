{"body": "\nChris and Mostapha,\n\n\n\nHoneybee keeps crashing Rhino, when trying to either assign glazing from percentage, or get zone attributes or decompose by type.\n\n\n\nAs described in my precious Discussion it is happening when having somewhere around more than 100 zones.\n\n\n\nSo I tried to just perform the operations on some or even one of all the zones, after I solve their adjacency but it still crashes.\n\n\n\nI attach the files for you to check.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDimitris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1289280", "name": "Honeybee_Zones_Crashing.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1289281", "name": "Honeybee_Zones_Crashing.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "May 18, 2015 at 9:59am", "created_by": "doompop", "topic": "Honebee Keeps Crashing Rhino", "id": "topic_1289282"}
