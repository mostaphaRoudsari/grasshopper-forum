{"body": "\nHi Claudio,\n\n\n\nYou are welcome. That is great to hear as that is the main intention behind the whole development of Ladybug: ([http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/bs2013/p_2499.pdf](http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/bs2013/p_2499.pdf))\n\n\n\nYes. You can model them similar to any other surface in your model. Just model the shadings as surfaces and then assign either translucent material or transparent material (glass) to them and connect them to runDaylight with other Honeybee objects. Is that make sense?\n\n\n\nMake sure to use appropriate numbers for -ab, -ad and -aa. Check page 27 of Daysim tutorial for a an example for parameters ([https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16228160/Daysim3.0.Tutorial.pdf](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16228160/Daysim3.0.Tutorial.pdf)). I should add that the numbers are slightly high in the example though.
