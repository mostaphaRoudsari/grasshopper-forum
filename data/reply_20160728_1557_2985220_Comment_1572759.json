{"body": "\nHi Peter, thanks for your answer!\n\nNow I think I've done some other mistake. The simulation gives out that my daylight autonomy is lower than 0%, which is quite strange, also considering that I've no context around. I'm doing the simulation of a room with two windows, one on the east side and the other one exposed to south. I followed some simulations I've found on Hydra and I don't really understand which could be the error.\n\nI attach the .gh file of the simulation and a screenshot of the result of the room. Can you kindly give a look to it?\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for your help\n\n\n\nMarta\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1572761", "name": "result.jpg"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1572762", "name": "occupancy.csv"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1572763", "name": "annual_simulation.gh"}], "created_by_name": "marta tardiani", "created_at": "July 28, 2016 at 03:57PM", "created_by": "martatardiani", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1573022", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1572759"}
