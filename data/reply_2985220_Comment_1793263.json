{"body": "\nHi Francesco and Chris,\n\nThis is interesting.\n\nThese 2 possibilities will make clear to more than one the right process:\n\n1. Extract and/or display data from an hour to an hour for all the period (say 8 to 15)\n\n2. Extract and/or display data from an starting hour on a specific day to an hour of a specific day including all hours in that period.\n\nI'll say that until now i thought that analysisPeriod gives the second option and now i see that it gives the first.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "August 3, 2017 at 3:48am", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1793056", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1793263"}
