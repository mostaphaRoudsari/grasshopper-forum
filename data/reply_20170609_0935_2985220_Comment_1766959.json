{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\n\nDespite trying all of your suggestions, I am still having issues with the\u00a0**OpenStudio.OpenStudioModelCorePINVOKE\u00a0**error. Is this something that is wrong with my computer, rather than the software? I am looking for a reason to have my company upgrade my laptop, so if you have any suggestions I'd be very open to them.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nNick\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nicholas Rekstad", "created_at": "June 09, 2017 at 09:35AM", "created_by": "NicholasRekstad", "parent_id": "topic_1595941", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1766959"}
