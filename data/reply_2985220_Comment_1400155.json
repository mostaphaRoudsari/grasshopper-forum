{"body": "\nthank you for your relpy, Sda and ASE are the metrics implemented in LEED v4. There is a document on this\n\n[http://solemma.net/DIVADay/2014/11%20-%20DIVA%20Day%202014%20-%20LE...](http://solemma.net/DIVADay/2014/11%20-%20DIVA%20Day%202014%20-%20LEEDv4%20Panel%20Discussion.pdf)\n\n\u00a0[https://www.ies.org/store/product/approved-method-ies-spatial-dayli...](https://www.ies.org/store/product/approved-method-ies-spatial-daylight-autonomy-sda-and-annual-sunlight-exposure-ase-1287.cfm)\n\nActually I tried to calculate it with the mentioned component but the problem\u00a0is that it gives the percentage of time each node which is above 1000 lux but this is not ASE. I have to export the data into an excel sheet and calculate it manually. Mostapha had a post in previous discussions stating that**\"\u00a0****aSE calculation is a little bit tricky. I did partially implemented the calculation in the code but never exposed it as an output. I will try to post a discussion about the reasons behind this.\"** I was wondering if he can explain more about this issue.\n\nMahsa\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mahsa Zomorodian", "created_at": "November 13, 2015 at 5:16pm", "created_by": "MahsaZomorodian", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1400065", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1400155"}
