{"body": "\nso after a lot of using ladybug i finally stepped into honeybee. nice videos on youtube, but quite outdated and i'm getting lost easily.<br/> <br/> for instance, in \"honeybee workshop part 1\" many things are outdated and changed since then:<br/> <br/> 1)i'm not even able to generate \"sky with certain illuminance level\" ...the default value has disappeared through the versions and i don't know what to put... 1? 0,5? ..boooh..<br/> <br/> 2) how do I apply materials to objects? the \"generic material\" component is gone, and the video starts with that, so i'm stuck from the beginning\n\n\n\n3) and then i get a strange error when attempting to generate the RAD file. unfortunately i'm using the machine of a colleague and the message is notified in the native language and can be translated as \"the specified key was not present in the dictionary\".<br/> this appears immediately after i toggle \"write rad\" to True.<br/> Maybe does it have something to do with the fact i didn't set up materials because couldn't figure out how?\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" height=\"368\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/CGXSPqmGVn3Yu5HlDJ4YEjHZxqSL6gvD5WbG5XRHsyypsfCGK*VXdOsDDr13AXGVRYHnA7-kuaSDPg3a-eJr-dUj-RD*7Is-/upload.png?width=750\" width=\"656\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/CGXSPqmGVn3Yu5HlDJ4YEjHZxqSL6gvD5WbG5XRHsyypsfCGK*VXdOsDDr13AXGVRYHnA7-kuaSDPg3a-eJr-dUj-RD*7Is-/upload.png)thanks for helping!<br/><br/>ps i went to check and it seems that a folder has been created with a .sky and .typ file\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jay Ramos", "created_at": "April 2, 2016 at 11:10am", "created_by": "JayRamos", "topic": "noob with honeybee", "id": "topic_1498937"}
