{"body": "\nTo illuminate this issue more, I plotted the outdoor and indoor temp in excel and annotated the graph below. The time frame is nine days in the summer.\u00a0\n\nThe brown line represents the indoor temperature when the 33C maxOutdoorTemp is used. It is obvious that the nightflush does not start in the evening until outdoor temperature drops below 33C, even when indoor is above 37C. However, in the morning, it is not clear to me why the zone does not always reach a closed state when outdoor temperature exceeds 33C. Instead, it looks like it occurs around 35C.\u00a0\n\nI see that these conditions are not persistent so perhaps some clues to why these few instances stand out would be helpful.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/dszxoG-AMGmjOTO4QGEVbcogyLFvjIwJ58sqbDO4uD277aTKl0pGAn-R7XwywMYjplkTBP6ZZcuBZDvAtY2cuzqs6LyPmFPH/Honeybeeerror.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/dszxoG-AMGmjOTO4QGEVbcogyLFvjIwJ58sqbDO4uD277aTKl0pGAn-R7XwywMYjplkTBP6ZZcuBZDvAtY2cuzqs6LyPmFPH/Honeybeeerror.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kit Elsworth", "created_at": "April 3, 2017 at 8:51am", "created_by": "KitElsworth", "parent_id": "topic_1725886", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1726516"}
