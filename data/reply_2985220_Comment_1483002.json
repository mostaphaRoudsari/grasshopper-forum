{"body": "\nhi Chris and Mostapha,\n\nmany thanks for your reply. I have managed to solve it but not sure how much of it witchcraft and how much I can rationally explain. The long story involves the dowloading and installing of 3 previous versions of Ladybird and Honeybee but nothing different happened. This was all happening on a desktop PC running windows 10 and with a wired connection to the internet router (via a switch). I then tried installing Ladybug and Honeybee on a MacBook Pro running Windows 7 on bootcamp. This computer was wirellesly connected to the same router. The installation of the latest version was very smooth and all the right files of the right sizes appeared without any problem on the first import of Honeybee-Honeybee. I then copied the files over to the other computer. Solved.\n\n1. good thing I didn't know that as I wouldn't have kept on trying to resolve it!\n\n2. Ok, sticking with it - besides I would hate miss out on such a major release!\n\n3. Makes sense.\n\n4. ok, I thought that that was the main file because of the EP in the title - I now have them both anyway.\n\n5. Now that you say this when I click on the file in github and download it from the view raw link then I do get the right file size. But when I have been trying to download it directly from the root folder (i.e.Honeybee/resources) with \"save link as\" then I get the 36kB. Could it be that Honeybee_Honeybee was doing something similar?\n\nMany thanks again to both of you - great work out there!\n\nbest,\n\nAlex\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alexander Giarlis", "created_at": "March 12, 2016 at 12:44pm", "created_by": "AlexanderGiarlis", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1482991", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1483002"}
