{"body": "\nHi Chris + Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThanks for replies. I believe it was a component version issue although I am hesitant to commit fully since I checked that the first time I rain into the error. Regardless, I did a fresh overhaul over the Ladybug and Honeybee components and it seemed to work after that. I may have had mismatching components before...perhaps a mix between the Jan26 and Jan28 updates.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kit Elsworth", "created_at": "April 27, 2016 at 8:00pm", "created_by": "KitElsworth", "parent_id": "topic_1506037", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1517772"}
