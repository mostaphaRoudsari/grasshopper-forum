{"body": "\nDear Group,\n\n\n\nI'm trying to use butterfyl now. I'm almost sure I installed OpenFoam properly. But when I open the installer in grasshopper, here comes an error as below. Is there anyother way to install Butterfly? Like for ladybug and honeybee, we can copy paste files to user objects folder.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/4P6PC2FXGK0DJqPqBN9Bi6QwlvESfBCqndt-GXCU4qKMuv8fAu9tpmaiqTdrS5*Htq2MFng*SrhhELeLvaBHRqFZYRYTHeV-/error.PNG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/4P6PC2FXGK0DJqPqBN9Bi6QwlvESfBCqndt-GXCU4qKMuv8fAu9tpmaiqTdrS5*Htq2MFng*SrhhELeLvaBHRqFZYRYTHeV-/error.PNG)Appreciate for your help!\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nChenyang\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chenyang", "created_at": "November 10, 2016 at 10:49AM", "created_by": "Chenyang", "topic": "Having trouble installing butterfly", "id": "topic_1636596"}
