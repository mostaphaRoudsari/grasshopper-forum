{"body": "\nHi Grasshope,\n\nI believe the issue is worst than what you submitted.\n\nI have to say that i open the idf with E+8.3 Launcher. The idf version is 8.4, but i don't think thinks have changed so much for the following:\n\nSee attached. As you can see the requirements of the editor are completely different than those of the supplied in the idf. Some inputs are mismatched and some inputs are missing (those in blue).\n\nMaybe this is caused by the recent changes Chris implemented with OpenStudio stuff. I don't know. I would report this issue in the github.\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1570219", "name": "Capture.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 22, 2016 at 07:02AM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1569809", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570217"}
