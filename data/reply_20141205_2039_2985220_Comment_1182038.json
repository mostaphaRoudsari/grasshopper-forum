{"body": "\nThanks Peter. This is very interesting! I would have never found this bug, as I would have never used the components in this order.\n\nMasoome, Peter is true that this is not the common workflow but it should have worked for you anyways. It was a bug and I fixed it. You can update your files with github or follow peter's suggestion.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/KzOvBNTGFEH*udDcixhEuFgdLlaLFST8vuZ4zcFDP-Q4dM2X4obKp90nW3CXqkQjIjI9l0O-fPuxWq6rdptUSvVaXk4qgRj4/addGlazing_alternate.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/KzOvBNTGFEH*udDcixhEuFgdLlaLFST8vuZ4zcFDP-Q4dM2X4obKp90nW3CXqkQjIjI9l0O-fPuxWq6rdptUSvVaXk4qgRj4/addGlazing_alternate.png)\n\n\n\nAlso it is always good to upload your file with your question. It will be much easier to help.\n\n\n\nLet us know if you have any other questions,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 05, 2014 at 08:39PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1181701", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182038"}
