{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you for your response. I am sorry for the incomplete information, it was late, I was getting frustrated with myself, and my file was full of unconnected components while trying to get around this.\n\n\n\nI managed to clean this a bit, with a clear mind. Also, I used to visit the example page regularly, I hadn't seen the example file. Thanks for that. I connected everything ok now.\n\n\n\nThe issue is that in your example, you have 1 window per zone while I have several windows per zone. Also, I have 2 curved surfaces for which the shades are not created for. That seems reasonable since the surface is actually a collection of smaller polygons (I seem to remember Chris mentioning that honeybee automatically does that so energy plus can run). I try to bypass the first issue with the use of a bang tree, assigning the test windows separately. Unfortunately, when I try to connect the first test window, grasshopper completely frozes.\n\n\n\nI am attaching the definition. Please bear in mind my settings are for a full year simulation at the moment, might want to care about that as it is quite intensive to read results.\n\n\n\nThank you very much and sorry again for the lack of info.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1225659", "name": "OfficeTower.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 16, 2015 at 8:27pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1225488", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1225657"}
