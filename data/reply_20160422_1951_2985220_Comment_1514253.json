{"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\n\n\nI'm not really working on it atm. I think the way to find reflex vertices is through the CCW algorithm Mostapha shared. As I said, the middle vertex should be reflex if it is not a CCW triad of points. Perhaps the code in the site shared by Mostapha can work right away and just spit out any reflex vertex out of that in this way.\n\nThe next step which I'm not sure is the Rhinoscript required to find the intersections, check for a point in between, etc.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 22, 2016 at 07:51PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1514233", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1514253"}
