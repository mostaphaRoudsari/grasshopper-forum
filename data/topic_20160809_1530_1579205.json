{"body": "\n\n\nHi all,\n\n\n\nMaybe I am missing something but following on from the discussion here:\n\n[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/ashrae-90-1...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/ashrae-90-1-wall-construction)\n\n\n\nIt appears to me that the only a fraction of the constructions available in the OpenStudio components library are available in the current Honeybee Hive is this correct?\n\n\n\nIf a construction is not available from the Honeybee hive what is the best way of applying a component from the building component library? I'd like to apply a construction like so as using the apply open studio measure seems a bit clunky in this case.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/S8fITn3IbtvFFAD4Y1MI0zm2eP4*CheOf7SPYG9K2QWFswCExikJPmpr54ln6Rv5Lo8BcbbfXRPKH30GqetzkemjK4fF6Krx/exampleworkflow.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/S8fITn3IbtvFFAD4Y1MI0zm2eP4*CheOf7SPYG9K2QWFswCExikJPmpr54ln6Rv5Lo8BcbbfXRPKH30GqetzkemjK4fF6Krx/exampleworkflow.JPG)\n\n\n\nYour thoughts and comments are most appreciated!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anton Szilasi", "created_at": "August 09, 2016 at 03:30PM", "created_by": "AntonSzilasi", "topic": "Building components library vs Honeybee construction library", "id": "topic_1579205"}
