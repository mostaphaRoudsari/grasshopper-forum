{"body": "\nHello all!\n\n\n\nI am writing my master thesis on innovative building performance simulation software and how useful they are in architectural design. As I am trying many different geometrical configurations, I have a problem regarding a single surface that is marked as \"ceiling\" by Honeybee's Adjacency module , while it should be an outdoor \"roof\". Is there anyway I could change its type manually or tweak the settings of Adjacency module so it gets it right?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nEhsan\n\n\n\nP.S. GH file is attached.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "un.form.ed", "created_at": "October 05, 2016 at 03:53AM", "created_by": "un.form.ed", "topic": "Changing the type of a surface manually", "id": "topic_1611344"}
