{"body": "\nHello,\n\nrecently I came across the problem of the non-convex casting surfaces when performing EnergyPlus analysis.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k8B0fL58gIu0SOd4b7ojVlVTVVCZXF2I7oWWkxn5OaoFuMfoYwX7iJf0OV8i54AbTmNGwflAmBuACcI5qf6lpwmlLY9VwZHl/01.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k8B0fL58gIu0SOd4b7ojVlVTVVCZXF2I7oWWkxn5OaoFuMfoYwX7iJf0OV8i54AbTmNGwflAmBuACcI5qf6lpwmlLY9VwZHl/01.jpg)\n\n\n\nI checked out and I understood the problem was the exposed floors of the building model that were L shaped, so I understood EnergyPlus doesn't like that.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k8B0fL58gItCs2y6n73wSl1wf8DMnzc-PASDzCG-Axv8XYE0Gd95slCGuctoEAjOx38H6HlZMp9afLFbuSkfQaBgWI56h2IN/02.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k8B0fL58gItCs2y6n73wSl1wf8DMnzc-PASDzCG-Axv8XYE0Gd95slCGuctoEAjOx38H6HlZMp9afLFbuSkfQaBgWI56h2IN/02.jpg)\n\n\n\nI had to remake the algorithm that generate the building model (in different variations) so that the exposed floors were always 4 sided convex surfaces and it worked fine for the energy simulations, but this algorithm or even a simple 3D model like this take longer time.\u00a0\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/k8B0fL58gIt3lH6EmkLdWElBJ4*lekSTYiTcovP1VOmO1BDKtMzWCMflA6QCPJsWMkwB9bSYIAcTUJoM*E3pTwUJczMd2*jz/03.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/k8B0fL58gIt3lH6EmkLdWElBJ4*lekSTYiTcovP1VOmO1BDKtMzWCMflA6QCPJsWMkwB9bSYIAcTUJoM*E3pTwUJczMd2*jz/03.jpg)\n\n\n\nSo the question is: is it possible you realize and include in Honeybee a component that automatically create convex surfaces from non-conves ones? Something similar the component that automatically split the building masses so\u00a0adjacent zones can have the same contact surface. Thank you!!!\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco De Luca", "created_at": "April 14, 2016 at 03:14AM", "created_by": "FrancescoDeLuca", "topic": "EnergyPlus non-convex casting sufaces issue", "id": "topic_1508492"}
