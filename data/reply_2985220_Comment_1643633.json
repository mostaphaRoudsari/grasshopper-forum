{"body": "\nIt's because I am not a pro in Rhino or GH. It's very funny but irritating ;) I created the HB file again from the scratch. now my favorite box, which doesn't dissappear is red. I think it is related to my Rhino.\u00a0\n\nPlease check out this new HB file. ( I had to flip by grid, because HB picked my wall instead of floor to create an analysis mesh. and I don't know if it will be a problem later in my energy modeling, anyhow.. )\n\nPlease help me with this graphic issue. I appreciate that.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1643634", "name": "Grid-Based_LG.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1643635", "name": "TestHB.3dm"}], "created_by_name": "Ladan GD", "created_at": "November 21, 2016 at 11:49am", "created_by": "LillyGD", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1643396", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1643633"}
