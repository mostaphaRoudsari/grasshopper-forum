{"body": "\nHi djordje,<br/>\n\n\n\nGreat thanks to your immediate and detailed reply. I am working on it based on your advice above, please forgive me for my late reply.\n\n\n\nI have searched for some issues as same as mine. And I tend to do the similar thing as Amaraa's([http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/finding-an-...](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/finding-an-optimal-size-of-pv-panel-in-given-array)), to explore an optimal pv array with the most AC energy production.\n\n\n\nI plan to set three parameters (orientation, tilt angle and distance of pv), and use Galapagos to make a best horizontal pv grid of most AC energy. So the most important is to avoid the\u00a0dark core-shadows from shelf shading. If so, I wonder whether the gh document you uploaded in the discussion named \"Finding an optimal size of PV panel in given array\" will be helpful to me. And should I use the Sun Path component to calculate the self shading?\n\n\n\nThank you.\u00a0\n\n[\u00a0](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/Amartuvshin)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bi Xiaojian", "created_at": "November 02, 2016 at 09:56AM", "created_by": "BiXiaojian415", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1630224", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1631053"}
