{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nI am trying to run a solar radiation analysis. I downloaded the script from github and also rewrote the script several times. The result does not offer a range it just turns blue. I have tried changing the test geometry as well as the weather file and the result remains the same. I have attached a copy of the grasshopper script as well as an image of what I am getting. Any guidance I would be greatly appreciated!\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you!\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1604678", "name": "Capture.JPG"}], "created_by_name": "Melissa Jimenez", "created_at": "September 23, 2016 at 9:26am", "created_by": "MelissaJimenez", "topic": "Radiation Analysis", "id": "topic_1604679"}
