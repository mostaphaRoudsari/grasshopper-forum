{"body": "\nHi Chris and Theodore,\n\nChris- I think we can have a pre-release soon with updated version. My only concern is that because of issues with loading OpenStudio libraries we will still need 8.1. Chien Si is making great progress on his side.\n\n\n\nTheodoros- Thank you for the offer. I'm not sure if we can distribute version 8-1 based on the license. I might be wrong though. If you have checked the license and it's fine then that sounds like a good idea.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "February 22, 2015 at 8:48am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1228635", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1229412"}
