{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nWe had some students installed multiple copies of LB+HB on our lab computers. There are also students who installed LB+HB, but the component is not usable, such as the LB component dragged on the canvas appears as an empty panel.\n\n\n\nIn other situation, the LB components are all gone when they open the demo file we prepared for them on their computer with LB+HB installed. In this situation, it seems the GHPython component is broken - it appears as a blank panel on canvas.\n\n\n\n(sorry, didn't manage to save a screen image for the problems described here)\n\n\n\nCurrently, we ask them to remove LB+HB using the **remove** component, restart Rhino and GH, and try a fresh installation, and see if this works...\n\n\n\nNevertheless, pls kindly advise if you have encountered similar problems before.\n\n\n\nThank you very much!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "August 19, 2015 at 08:51AM", "created_by": "Grasshope", "topic": "[urgent] duplicate installation and unusable components", "id": "topic_1345816"}
