{"body": "\nHi Chris and Mostapha!<br/><br/>Where are we on the matter of including the runItAll component in Honeybee as Mostapha sugested in his reply? <br/><br/>I am currently writing a method document for my office and in one of the chapters I describe the process of running multiple iterations. I would really like to be able to include the runItAll compoment.\u00a0<br/><br/>I know that TT Toolbox's Brute Force does the same thing. There is however an issue with the Brute force component since it requires at least two sliders while your runItAll component allows for just one slider, which is why I prefer it over TTT.<br/><br/>I actually use the runItAll component quite a lot in my projects.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "\u00d6rn Erlendsson", "created_at": "August 28, 2015 at 03:23AM", "created_by": "OErnErlendsson", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1154567", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1350429"}
