{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nYeah i began to watch Mackey`s Videos. for time being, the temperature I was talking about is the interior temperature, not the building surface temperature. Hope I could get it from the videos that you mentioned. BTW, I am trying to do a termal based render in visualization which will show accurately how much warm people will feel inside the building. is it acchievable with LB?\n\n\n\nThank you!!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nLei\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lei  Yang", "created_at": "May 15, 2016 at 6:12am", "created_by": "LeiYang", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1529837", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1530613"}
