{"body": "\nHi Enjar, Thanks for the kind words. I remember your discussion about this. The main issue for showing the progress is to know how much of the progress is already done. [For radiance ray-tracing there is no easy way to do that](http://www.radiance-online.org:82/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010399.html). EnergyPlus and Rpict (Image-based) daylighting already generate some sort of reports. I assume your main request is for annual daylight analysis? In that case moving away from Daysim might actually help to find a solution. Sarith and I discussed the option to check the file size but haven't really tried it. I added a new issue to the new honeybee repository. You can follow the progress for this issue there: [https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybee/issues/120](https://github.com/ladybug-analysis-tools/honeybee/issues/120)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "January 23, 2017 at 05:44PM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1676795", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1677079"}
