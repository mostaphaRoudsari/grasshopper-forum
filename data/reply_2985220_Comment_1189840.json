{"body": "\nHello Mostapha,\n\n\n\nI use the Less Than Range output as values so it makes sense to be inverted.\n\n\n\nI tried also with the inTheRange at my desktop...and things seem to be working great.\n\nNo idea why the original weird \"split\" analysis occurred...If I haven t saved the image I would doubt myself it ever happened... I attach the file for future reference.\n\n\n\nMay I ask:\n\n\n\nHow much should we worry about the CreatHBSrfs **alerts regarding the normal direction:** **\"Normal direction of the surface is not expected for a FLOOR. The surface is more likely a ROOF.** **Honeybee won't overwrite the type so you may need to manually flip the surface.\"**?\n\nThanks once again!\n\nDimitris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1189841", "name": "Grid_Based_Annual_Daylight_Autonomy_Analysis_HB_02.gh"}, {"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1189842", "name": "Grid_Based_Annual_Daylight_Autonomy_Analysis_HB_02.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Dimitrios Papadopoulos", "created_at": "December 17, 2014 at 8:19am", "created_by": "doompop", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1189548", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1189840"}
