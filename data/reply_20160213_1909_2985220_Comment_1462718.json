{"body": "\nTo add to Mostapha's replies, here are a few of things to consider:\n\n\n\n**CIE Illuminants and Radiance/Honeybee**\n\nIn the context of your question, D65 relates to the color of the sky. More specifically, CIE Illuminants like \"A\" or \"D65\" are spectral power distributions that are defined (as per CIE S 014-2/E:2006) for wavelengths ranging from 300nm to 830nm.\u00a0\n\nFor example, CIE Illuminants A,B and C are defined as :\n\n[<img class=\"align-left\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/CIE_illuminants_A%2CB%2CC.svg/700px-CIE_illuminants_A%2CB%2CC.svg.png?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/CIE_illuminants_A%2CB%2CC.svg/700px-CIE_illuminants_A%2CB%2CC.svg.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd D65 is defined as :\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/SPD_D65.png?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/SPD_D65.png)For illuminance and luminance calculations, the radiation from such illuminants are converted to Lux or Candela/sq.m by weighing them against the Photopic Luminous Efficiency function (also called as V-lambda):\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/CIE_1931_Luminosity.png/1280px-CIE_1931_Luminosity.png?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/CIE_1931_Luminosity.png/1280px-CIE_1931_Luminosity.png)The equation (1) used for this purpose is\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/2/9a2784abf032740c36f15f235c79901a.png?width=350\" width=\"350\"/>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/2/9a2784abf032740c36f15f235c79901a.png)\n\nWhere y corresponds to the V-lambda function and J corresponds to an illuminant like \"D65\" or \"A\".\n\n\n\nSo, why is all this relevant? Honeybee/Radiance also use a similar method for calculation of luminous flux, illuminance and luminance. However, in the case of Honeybee/Radiance the lighting calculations are limited only 3\u00a0 (R,G,B) channels (and not the 300nm to 830nm). So the equation (1) from above becomes something like:\n\n\n\nF = 47.4*R+120*G+11.6*B\n\n\n\nWhere (R,G,B) refers to the spectral power of the radiation and the numbers (47.4,120,11.6) relate to the V-lambda function. <br/> So, the bottom line is that an accurate representation of CIE illuminants is not possible inside Radiance/Honeybee as the spectral information is severely restricted. Some studies have proposed using Radiance with more than 3 channels.<br/> For example: [http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBRM.40.1.304](http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBRM.40.1.304) . However, such attempts have been limited. <br/> <br/> <br/> What is possible with Radiance/Honeybee is to create a fairly accurate representation of brightness of the sky. Although, I can explain that too, I would suggest that you try this link first: [http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php?module=FAQ&amp;func=dis...](http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php?module=FAQ&amp;func=display&amp;faqid=5)\n\n\n\nBy the way, which CIE document are you referring to for CIE sky definitions ?\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "February 13, 2016 at 07:09PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1462343", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1462718"}
