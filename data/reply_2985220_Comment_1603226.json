{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\n\n\nMay I ask if the PMV comfort calculator component can take **multiple list of clothing level values**?\n\n\n\nThe following is the percentage of comfort hours calculated for 6 zones using a fixed clothing level of 0.5.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/iTmAuSUr3riiIi-z03lCmLkb-77LKNUhthar5x46xv2bIBu5IwuxsGZM22u-CnkbORxKzxS3Uu8bT8tNKrTRdVj9NXt0ovAg/Image12.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/iTmAuSUr3riiIi-z03lCmLkb-77LKNUhthar5x46xv2bIBu5IwuxsGZM22u-CnkbORxKzxS3Uu8bT8tNKrTRdVj9NXt0ovAg/Image12.png)\n\n\n\nUsing the clothing level component, a list of 8760 clothing level values are created, and it is duplicated for each zone, as shown below. However, when the 6 lists of clothing level is used for the PMV component, the percentage of comfort hours are obviously problematic as shown below. It seems the PMV component does assign each of the clothing level list to its respective zone.\n\n\n\nMay I ask what might be the source of the problem here?\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n- Ji\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/iTmAuSUr3rjh9*gCOKy8yuyD7iSqNNVGdq9-85GnMp25Emp6dMEV8X6BAwWnIdAhodMyJdX0DefbGqTTIgHY5YQPXnql1Dgu/Image13.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/iTmAuSUr3rjh9*gCOKy8yuyD7iSqNNVGdq9-85GnMp25Emp6dMEV8X6BAwWnIdAhodMyJdX0DefbGqTTIgHY5YQPXnql1Dgu/Image13.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Grasshope", "created_at": "September 21, 2016 at 12:53am", "created_by": "Grasshope", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1601557", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1603226"}
