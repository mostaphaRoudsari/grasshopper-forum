{"body": "\nHi Mostapha and Reinier,\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks for bringing this topic up - incredibly useful tool the Mesh2Rad.\n\nHowever I am trying to feed an additional .rad file to Annual simulations and it does not work.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI've noticed that it works with Image Based, and Grid Analysis. But with annual simulations (DAYSIM), it is impossible to feed additional rad file. I am working with complex geometries and Oconv.exe crashes every time, so it is a useful tool.\u00a0\n\nI am attaching a supersimple example.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDo you have the same trouble?\n\nthanks!\n\nberardo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1296423", "name": "Annual Sim.jpg"}], "created_by_name": "Berardo Matalucci", "created_at": "May 27, 2015 at 8:17am", "created_by": "BerardoMatalucci", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1128559", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1296421"}
