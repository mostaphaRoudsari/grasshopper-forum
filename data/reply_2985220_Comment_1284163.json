{"body": "\nI would say that in your case adding them as shading context (which is what the Honeybee component does I believe) should be enough. You would only need energy zones to understand and include the energy transfer between boundaries. In that case I would just simulate all the adjacent zones and remove the zones not interested in from the calculation of the results.\n\n\n\nAs an example of a more relevant case I was simulating semi-detached, 3 storey houses. Adding each of the house as a context of the other wasn't enough so I simply simulated both of them and broke the results apart. I'm guessing that's correct.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "May 10, 2015 at 7:45pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1282243", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1284163"}
