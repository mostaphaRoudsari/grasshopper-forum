{"body": "\nHi,\n\nAdditionally, i disconnected my custom materials (just to check if it runs). Now i get an error saying the schedule i use for the window's blinds is not in the HB schedule library. Also some fields in the people section are missing (i'm using defaults according to chosen activity).\n\nProbably i'm doing something wrong here, but maybe ... i'm not :-) since the HB_runEnergySimulation runs fine in the same file.\n\nThanks,\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "July 24, 2016 at 9:09pm", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570701", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1570707"}
