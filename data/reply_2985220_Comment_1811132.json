{"body": "\nThank you again, Chris\n\nI will start with the modeling and come back to you maybe several times.\n\nDo you mean modeling the building with the panel or only the panel? Because not all the orientations receive\u00a0direct sun radiation at the same time. The building causes shading on the panels when the Sun is at the other side also self-shading occurs between the panels themselves.\n\nHow do you recommend me to start with GH modeling? Whole building with all the integrated panels? Or a lower number of the panels? Or one storey etc.?\n\n\n\nThanks for the help.\n\nHardi\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hardi Barznji", "created_at": "on Saturday", "created_by": "HardiBarznji", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1811085", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1811132"}
