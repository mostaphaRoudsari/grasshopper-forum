{"body": "\nHi Dimitrios,\n\nThanks for reporting. \u00a0The changing of the boundaries when you hook up legend parameters was intentional since I imagined users inputting their own boundaries that go along with their custom parameters. \u00a0However, I can see now how this can be confusing so I have changed the default to not change the boundaries unless the user inputs custom boundaries into the legend parameters component.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/njfi925B3DDKjiwv7SPXlNjHkfr9P4viIxHSxymJbubTCQI1XMGlgz0n58fFUeTongd7RlzFdNGpTjeVDz-XbGusaFwUfgLl/FixedShadeBenefit.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/njfi925B3DDKjiwv7SPXlNjHkfr9P4viIxHSxymJbubTCQI1XMGlgz0n58fFUeTongd7RlzFdNGpTjeVDz-XbGusaFwUfgLl/FixedShadeBenefit.PNG)\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "February 28, 2015 at 5:48pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1231884", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1233602"}
