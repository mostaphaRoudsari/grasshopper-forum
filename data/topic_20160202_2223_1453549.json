{"body": "\nHello people,\n\n\n\nI was wondering if someone can give me some advice on the following.\n\n\n\nI am planning to do an outdoor thermal comfort assessment.\n\n\n\nI will be using CFD simulations to get average velocities in specific points in the geometry. I would then want to input the different average velocities I calculate for all the different points to the outdoor comfort tools and workflow recently designed and updated in HB/LB. Would such a thing be possible and how could I (if I could) couple it with the high resolution comfort maps from Chris's research?\n\n\n\nThank you so much in advance.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "February 02, 2016 at 10:23PM", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "Outdoor thermal comfort and Microclimate Maps", "id": "topic_1453549"}
