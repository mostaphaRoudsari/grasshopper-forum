{"body": "\nSolved! I changed the name of the input parameter of the setEPZoneCnstr\u00a0called \"_HBZone\" in \"_HBZones\" and now the component works! :) Could it be a bug in the honeybee? Anyway my problem is that now the simulation gets stuck at this component (attachment) .. Does anybody know why??\u00a0\n\n\n\nBtw I am not sure anymore at this point that the\u00a0\"setEPZoneCnstr\"\u00a0is the\u00a0right component to add the material to my geometry. I noticed that all the parameters of setEPZoneCnstr are like this:\n\n\n\nparameter_\n\n\n\ninstead of :\n\n\n\n_parameter\n\n\n\nDoes it mean that they need as a input just a toggle true to enable them? and how can I add the material then?\u00a0\n\n\n\nValerio\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1658952", "name": "Screenshot 2016-12-16 14.05.55.png"}], "created_by_name": "Valerio Soldera", "created_at": "December 16, 2016 at 06:17AM", "created_by": "ValerioSoldera", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1658331", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1658951"}
