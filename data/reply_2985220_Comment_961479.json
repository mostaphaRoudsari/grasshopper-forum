{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nI see your point now. You are changing the test point and the target points in your question. Pretty interesting indeed! I've never thought of it this way! [I feel stupid now! Hahaha. Of course you should be able to so this.] I'll modify the component later today so you can either input a point or a surface for test.\n\n\n\nEven though the component is not designed for what you are looking for, it is still possible to get what you want out of it by creating some fake test surfaces. Checked the attached file!\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/1Q*fTOyGxIC11NMxVs0O-DS-eWzyE1VmzpfZUQvqaOyiwaJzzBiv78ZcflN6RCVdG6nwl1p*D2T28dCj-S8FoBCwG8LIbTVI/viewAnalysis_03.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/1Q*fTOyGxIC11NMxVs0O-DS-eWzyE1VmzpfZUQvqaOyiwaJzzBiv78ZcflN6RCVdG6nwl1p*D2T28dCj-S8FoBCwG8LIbTVI/viewAnalysis_03.png)\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A961480", "name": "viewAnalysis_03.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 21, 2013 at 8:21am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_961528", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_961479"}
