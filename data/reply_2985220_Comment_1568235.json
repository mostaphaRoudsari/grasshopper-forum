{"body": "\nWould the panel be in a constant angle to the sun rays throughout the day?\n\n\n\nI really don't know a lot about rotating panels and their operative characteristics, but if you could assume that the mechanism is able to work in such a way that the panel always retains a (optimum) angle to the incoming solar radiation then the problem really becomes a series of hourly solar radiation simulations with that specific tilt/azimuth.\n\n\n\nYou could set up smth like this with native GH components and/or the fly! HB component.\n\n<br/>Not sure it makes sense though, others more experienced can add ideas perhaps.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTheodore.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "July 18, 2016 at 8:10pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1562211", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1568235"}
