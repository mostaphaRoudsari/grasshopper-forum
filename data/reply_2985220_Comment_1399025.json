{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\nThank you for your reply. I noticed also that when I am changing my initial geometry, in case I set up HB surface and then create and HB zone out of them usig the \"HB_createHBzones\" component it gives me back this error: \"\n\n1. Solution exception: f8c3915661d0437fa89a_23 has been moved, scaled or rotated.<br/>If you need to move or rotate a Honeybee object you should use Honeybee move, rotate or mirror components. You can find them under 12|WIP tab.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\nAfter that I need to either restart Rhino and the model and insert new HB components \u00a0or Recompute the model with the new geometry, which in some cases is not really solving the problem.\n\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\n\nTasos\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anastasios Kokkos", "created_at": "November 12, 2015 at 3:42am", "created_by": "AnastasiosKokkos", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1401160", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1399025"}
