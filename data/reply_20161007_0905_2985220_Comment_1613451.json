{"body": "\nFrancesco,\n\nI just checked how the CBE tool works when you plot operative temperature on the x-axis.\u00a0 The tool simply does not allow you to set separate air and radiant temperatures and I guess that I could do something similar on a psych chart component.\n\nTo illustrate what I meant, you could take a case like the one below:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/99aVnO*4LGcHXveC9k6XbfppAFhEcPM8z5Xht4NvNUxsU7hzhoT05WgXZRGWIN2VxBK3E0GgTXm4csE1PAzdbXH9sAPvPutT/CBEToolOpTemp.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/99aVnO*4LGcHXveC9k6XbfppAFhEcPM8z5Xht4NvNUxsU7hzhoT05WgXZRGWIN2VxBK3E0GgTXm4csE1PAzdbXH9sAPvPutT/CBEToolOpTemp.JPG)\n\nIf I increased the air temperature without increasing the radiant temperature, the red dot would fall off of the psych chart (it would essentially be above the saturation line).\u00a0 This is because the warm, 100% humid air can hold more water vapor than air than 100% humid air at the cooler operative temperature.\u00a0 Does that make snese?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 07, 2016 at 09:05AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1610658", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1613451"}
