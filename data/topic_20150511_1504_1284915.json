{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI know it sounds silly, but I am currently working on a small passive pavilion project, so it has no mechanical HAVC system. What I am trying to analyze is the DB Temperature differences between inside the pavilion and outside, and generated a visualized map.\u00a0\n\nSo the question is which component I should work with to visualized the temperature differences? I tried HB-indoorAirTemMap component but it only provided a solid color distribution at floor plate level (attached). How can I get the indoorAirTemMap and OutdoorAirTemMap at the same time to see the passive strategies performance?\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1284914", "name": "HB-in vs out.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Yao Zheng", "created_at": "May 11, 2015 at 03:04PM", "created_by": "YaoZheng", "topic": "any chance to compare temperature with inside vs outside with LB+HB?", "id": "topic_1284915"}
