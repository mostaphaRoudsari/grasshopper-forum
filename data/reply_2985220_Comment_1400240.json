{"body": "\nDuncan,\n\n\n\nYou are modeling the DSF correctly and the solve adjacencies for the interior windows is performing as advertised.\n\n\n\nHowever, I noticed that you mis-labeled some of the output data, though. \u00a0When you want very detailed results like temperatures of individual surfaces, it is useful to label the surface with a name that makes it easy to keep track of throughout the simulation setup and result-reading. \u00a0You will see in the attached file that the name of the surface shows up in the header of the \"Read EP Surface Result\" data stream and I used this to label your glass correctly.\n\n\n\nAlso, notice in the attached file how the inner surface temperature of each of the interior glass surfaces is equal to the outer surface temperature of the adjacent interior surface. This shows you that the solve adjacency is working correctly in EnergyPlus.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1400242", "name": "151113_DSF_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 13, 2015 at 5:37pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "topic_1399700", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1400240"}
