When we have two connected zones (for those walls overlapping), the component checks whether the walls overlap, and when it does it splits the wall (physically?) in order to separate\u00a0surfaces from the non-overlapping\u00a0wall part.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt will be much appreciated if someone can kindly explain (maybe through some example file) to explain the functionality of each component and how they are different from each other.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you!\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "john chun", "created_at": "August 15, 2017 at 12:19pm", "created_by": "johnchun", "topic": "Can someone please explain the functionality of Intersect Mass and Solve Adjacencies component?", "id": "topic_1799114"}
