{"body": "\nHi Abraham,\n\nThanks a lot for your reply.\n\nI opened your file and everything seems ok when using ASHRAE's materials. But when I try using my own materials E+ generates severe errors until it crush.\n\nI realise there was a mistake in the materials settings, since I was using air gaps from glass into opaque constructions (wall and roofs). Now is fixed\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks for your support, everything is going well now.\n\nKind regards,\n\n\u00a0\n\nJavier\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Javier", "created_at": "August 9, 2015 at 4:11pm", "created_by": "Javier387", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1330427", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1340665"}
