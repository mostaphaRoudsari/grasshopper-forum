{"body": "\nMehdi,\n\nThis transient PMV is some interesting research! \u00a0First, I will note that the components in your file are from several different versions and this can cause errors. \u00a0The attached file has everything updated.\n\nNow to answer your question:\n\nThere are many ways to post-process the results of the microclimate maps. \u00a0I don't know how exactly you want to do this or of there is something particular about the CSV that you need but here's an example showing how you can grab the MRT, air temperature, and humidity outputs of an energy simulation and run the through the PMV Comfort Calculator component:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/rCeewRRND-ctZjfg5OACib2g-Gt6rdfXS*kMix61p1phQ4AtHv6iz-bQvKV0cocyUXHuOMAzohqC*BD41wlc0T4fxwZ63eHM/CutomPMVMap.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/rCeewRRND-ctZjfg5OACib2g-Gt6rdfXS*kMix61p1phQ4AtHv6iz-bQvKV0cocyUXHuOMAzohqC*BD41wlc0T4fxwZ63eHM/CutomPMVMap.JPG)\n\nI could not get your transient PMV component to run correctly on my machine but it's looking like you just want to take these microclimate map results and run them though your special PMV calculator. \u00a0Then, you can color the viewFactorMesh with the results like so:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/rCeewRRND-fdLB2Le6qMdzGM3LjlXmPAwFITfVDLqelCviCj1dWHzxsTBc9onq0wBCVEBQaBA3g4ZvgEmN4HJZJU09ptQZm2/PMVVisual.JPG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/rCeewRRND-fdLB2Le6qMdzGM3LjlXmPAwFITfVDLqelCviCj1dWHzxsTBc9onq0wBCVEBQaBA3g4ZvgEmN4HJZJU09ptQZm2/PMVVisual.JPG)\n\nLet use know if this answers your question.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1723452", "name": "Microclimate_Map__Simple_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 29, 2017 at 10:06AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1722644", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1723450"}
