{"body": "\nThank you Chris,\u00a0\n\nYet another question. I would like to add other two factors to the microclimate simulation: local wind speed and evapotranspiration from plants. Is it possible?\n\n1- Local wind speed: I heard that you are working on the integration of Butterfly with HB/LB to include the effect of local wind speed to evaluate microclimate. Have you already produced any examples on this? If so, it would be very useful.\u00a0\n\nThe way I am working with this right now is exporting the wind simulation results from another software (Autodesk CFD) and importing them into Grasshopper. I run simulation for 8 wind directions (every 45 degrees) and extrapolating the local wind speed for each point hourly considering the hourly weather data (wind speed and wind direction).\u00a0\n\n2- Evapotranspiration effect from trees and other plants. Is it possible at all to evaluate this with HB? I have not found any reference to evapotranspiration in the forum.\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nAlejandro\u00a0\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez", "created_at": "December 9, 2016 at 6:57am", "created_by": "3ahr35r8m5dl1", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1633661", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1654867"}
