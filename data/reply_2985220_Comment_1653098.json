{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nnow I understand your comment: we have not attached the heating thermostat set point to 0 Celsius for all of the heatDesignDay - it seems we have done this, but if you check our file previously attached you will see we have linked the correct schedule for the design day.\n\nThe schedule with 0 Celsius has been used only for Sunday and holiday.\n\n\n\nMoreover, if we detach all the schedules, we still obtain the same issues.\n\n\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\nThanks,\n\nRiccardo\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LacygCl0qQKdBQCq5hW0Jel80CY0jqkttuejXLocQ7ViYpQOxOPK4akIdJGxr*WUlqhtoIg*oGHuV23qyQkWGReSts-IXdDv/ff.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/LacygCl0qQKdBQCq5hW0Jel80CY0jqkttuejXLocQ7ViYpQOxOPK4akIdJGxr*WUlqhtoIg*oGHuV23qyQkWGReSts-IXdDv/ff.png)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Riccardo Diaferia", "created_at": "December 6, 2016 at 8:49am", "created_by": "RiccardoDiaferia49", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1652850", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1653098"}
