{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\nThank you for adding this discussion and the resources. This is a good discussion to be added to github so we can implement it at some point. I personally have no experience in using either EMS or FMU, but I can see how they can be really helpful for advance users.\n\nSince we already have so much in our plate I don't think I will find a time soon to implement them. At the same time if either of you [or anybody else on the group] is willing to take on the development I will be happy to support you during the process.\n\nCheers,\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "June 19, 2015 at 5:26am", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1310931", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1311815"}
