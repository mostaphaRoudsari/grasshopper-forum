{"body": "\nThanks Chris,\n\nOn the contrary. Thank you for having the patience to deal with this.\n\nI get and accept your explanations. make sense and are clear. I can use your arguments to explain myself.\n\n\n\nAnother (maybe last) couple of questions.\n\nYou have some rule of thumb (or source) for input values for the LB_solarHeatCapacity_? The default values of 50 W/m2 is for a small passive solar heated space (full glazed facade).But i'm changing the default to relatively low values and it is not affecting the results.\n\n\n\nI have a feeling that the temperature checking you are doing for the Thermal Mass is a bit tight. Is very hard to improve. Changing the timeConstant_ in the StrategyPar affects a lot the PSH but very little the ThM. The reason i'm asking is because for some locations i know that the thermal mass has a big influence. Though, the chart shows a small one as a total value but also looking at the 3DChart plot.\n\n\n\nThanks again!!\n\n-A.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Abraham Yezioro", "created_at": "September 07, 2017 at 12:35PM", "created_by": "AbrahamYezioro", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810104", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1810181"}
