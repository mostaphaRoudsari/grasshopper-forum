{"body": "\nA grid indeed seems the easiest way to start. I was thinking of using a similar technique for electrical lighting optimization with the new HB components.\n\n\n\nIn a definition I have, where I wanted to keep 2 geometries from overlapping what I did was similar to what Mostapha suggests. I measured for the distance between the two edges I wanted to keep apart and then set an if statement with the minimum distance I wanted. When that check failed, the false boolean was fed into the simulation component. When it passed the true was passed instead and the simulation would go on. In you case, given that the windows have a constant size and geometry, I'm sure you can find a formula to check the distance between the area centers (e.g. in a square min distance is x/2, etc.)\n\n\n\nNot sure if it is the most elegant of solutions but it seemed to work quite well. Furthermore, this check would limit substantially the number of alternatives you will be checking with Octopus.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "January 31, 2016 at 6:30pm", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1451552", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1451369"}
