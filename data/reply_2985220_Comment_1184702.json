{"body": "\nHi Dimitrios,\n\nIn general I don't suggest to use coloredSkyVisualizer for cases like this, since it is not climate based and may give you a wrong understanding. You can use Honeybee_watchTheSky component or Ladybug_skyDome.\n\nNevertheless, the results are correct and as expected since you have a very different radiation values for that two hours which will generate different skies.\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/-*rcMYSmUcWFY53zvJNmaDTq7KPTt7ts3JmBOz19S-TSHI2DbZHsvZ04s8YYga4wL*L6*q6AmHfxM6u2eYoFns03usECbXeN/skyRadiationValues.png?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/-*rcMYSmUcWFY53zvJNmaDTq7KPTt7ts3JmBOz19S-TSHI2DbZHsvZ04s8YYga4wL*L6*q6AmHfxM6u2eYoFns03usECbXeN/skyRadiationValues.png)\n\nThat's exactly the reason that there is an averagedClimateBasedSky component. It has no inputs for the day and averages the value for the whole month, so get a representation of that hour during the month.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "December 9, 2014 at 7:58pm", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "topic_1183727", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184702"}
