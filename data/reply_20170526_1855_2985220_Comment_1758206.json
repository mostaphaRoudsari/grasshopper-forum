{"body": "Won hee,\nYour assumption is correct. EnergyPlus is actually using mathematical abstraction of the blind, which accounts for the solar energy absorbed by the blind and the resulting increase in it's temperature. Essentially, EnergyPlus assumes this temperature of the blinds is the interior surface temperature of the window geometry and it uses this blind temperature to compute heat exchange between the closed blind surface and all of the other surfaces of the zone. This also means that the surface temperatures that we are plugging into the comfort maps is the correct one to account for the blind temperature.\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 26, 2017 at 06:55PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1757097", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1758206"}
