{"body": "\nHere is a quick hack. Create a really tiny polygon using Rhino/Grasshopper and specify that in the _HBObjects input. Specify all your remaining files using the additionalRadFiles_ input. Remember that as per the Radiance conventions, your material files should be specified first in the sequence of inputs. You can either specify the points file path directly or just create the points inside grasshopper using the value in the points file.\n\nAnother option, which might or might not work, is to use the import_rad component.\n\n\n\n-Sarith\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "June 26, 2017 at 08:11PM", "created_by": "sarith", "parent_id": "topic_1774861", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1774867"}
