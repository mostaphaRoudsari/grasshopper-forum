{"body": "\nSeems I overestimated both my design skills and eyesight. Had an invalid brep. Going over the design now, managed to close the breps (most of them). I now get an error while solving adjacencies \"number of windows doesnt match between (hexa name)\u00a0 and hexa name surfaces\".\n\n\n\nI am still getting the severe error of adiabatic surfaces. Is there something I am missing since the only place I see where I can assign adiabatic is in solve adjacencies.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "April 19, 2015 at 12:34am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "parent_id": "topic_1266751", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1266846"}
