{"body": "\nTasos,\n\nYou bring up an important issue that needed to be changed since the addition of air walls in the last release. \u00a0Mostapha had originally put in an option to \"removeInteriorWalls\" on the daylighting simulation component to help in cases where interior walls were just for the partitioning of thermal zones and not meant to be real solid walls.\n\nIn full implementation of air walls in the last release, I only changed how air walls worked for thermal simulations and did not change anything with regards to daylighting. \u00a0I have just changed this\u00a0\"removeInteriorWalls\" on the daylighting simulation component to be \"removeAirWalls\" and I have set the default to remove air wall surfaces (you can change this by setting\u00a0\"removeAirWalls\" to True).\n\nIf you sync with the github, you will be able to get the new daylighting simulation component that does this.\n\nAs for the\u00a0Add InternalMass to Zone component, I am afraid that I do not understand the problem. \u00a0What is the warning message that you are getting each time?\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "March 11, 2015 at 10:01PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240308", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1240861"}
