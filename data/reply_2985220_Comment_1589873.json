{"body": "\nDear Chris,\n\nI appreciate your thorough response. Sometime, my preference is to use ONLY building surfaces (wall, roof, window etc.), schedules, construction details and develop the IDF further as per my requirements without using Openstudio. And i know some professional do follow this path for detailed energy analysis. So i would prefer to have AND (IDF AND Openstudio) option rather than just OR option:)\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Javed Iqbal", "created_at": "August 28, 2016 at 11:03pm", "created_by": "JavedIqbal", "parent_id": "topic_1580355", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1589873"}
