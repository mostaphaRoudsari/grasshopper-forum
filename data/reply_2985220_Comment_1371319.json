{"body": "\nThe easiest solution is to use the [Deconstruct Brep] component and plug in the output faces into Python. You would have to do this for the [Honeybee_Generate Test Points] component as well.\n\nConcerning your second question below, that has to do with the way we call the function. In the Honeybee component, you will notice that Mostapha creates a new list from 'createMesh' and passes that through another function as an argument. So the organization is a bit different from what you're doing.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n/SPM\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stephen Maher", "created_at": "September 30, 2015 at 12:32pm", "created_by": "StephenPMaher", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1370924", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1371319"}
