{"body": "\nHi all.\n\nI noticed a strange behavior with this component. It seams that the legend txt as well as the degrees of the sunpath component when used within a file in meters It \u00a0outputs an out of scale title mesh. As soon as the scale is changed again to millimeters the legend works fine. I've always thought that all the analysis done in LB and HB should be in meters.\n\nIs anybody else having this problem?\n\n\n\nThank you\u00a0\n\ncheers\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claudio", "created_at": "May 02, 2017 at 11:37AM", "created_by": "Claudio", "topic": "LB SunLightHours scale issue in rhino 6", "id": "topic_1744386"}
