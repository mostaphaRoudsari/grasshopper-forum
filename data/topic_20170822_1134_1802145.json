{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI am working on a conceptual design and optimization workflow that relies on the link between Honeybee and OpenStudio. I am able to generate and run the EnergyPlus models in both Honeybee and OpenStudio without issue.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHowever, there are two main issues with output OSM file:\n\n1. Construction materials are currently assigned to individual zones or surfaces. Is it possible to define building level construction sets so that properties pass onto spaces and ultimately to surfaces?\u00a0\n\n\n\n2. Schedules and loads are assigned to each individual thermal zone. As a result, in the OpenStudio model, each zone has its own schedule set and load. Is there a way to specify loads and schedules per space type?\u00a0\n\n\n\nFollowing this hierarchy (building, space, zone, surface) is an important feature of OpenStudio and it can be achieved natively (via SketchUp). It would be great if I could somehow incorporate that logic into Honeybee and Grasshopper as well.\n\n\n\nThank you for the help!\u00a0\n\nAli \u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ali Irani", "created_at": "August 22, 2017 at 11:34AM", "created_by": "AliIrani", "topic": "Assigning building and space level construction and schedule sets", "id": "topic_1802145"}
