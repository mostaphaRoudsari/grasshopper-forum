{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\n\n\nI am trying to test the new comfort analysis components and I keep getting into this error. The Adaptive Comfort recipe component tells me my \"analysis period of the energy simulation data and the analysisPeriodorHOY _plugged into this component do not align\".\n\n\n\nAt first I had no analysis period as the default was to a year. Tried adding one for a whole year the error was still there. I tried to putting a month or even a few days but the error persists.\n\n\n\nAny ideas on this?Has anyone encountered it?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Was solved by changing analysis timestep to hourly. Duh.\n\n\n\nKind regards,<br/> Theodore.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1346748", "name": "MarrianeHouse.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Theodoros Galanos", "created_at": "August 21, 2015 at 12:14am", "created_by": "TheodorosGalanos", "topic": "[SOLVED]Adaptive Comfort Recipe - Analysis Period error", "id": "topic_1346749"}
