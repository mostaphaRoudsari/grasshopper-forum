{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI want to consider the shading effects of sill. It is like adding horizental and vertical shades around the glazing surface. I find the shadingdesigner component in ladybug. But can it be used in daylight and energy simulation? And how to add both\u00a0horizental and vertical shades on a\u00a0glazing surface at the same time?\n\nThank you for help.\n\nDan\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" height=\"436\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Kqu4JOS-VwPoBVE8LXt3f*DUw4EF4INRhRJLz3kIy5Sxi9m2NVRrRz2hkz1DqcY0Uu7eCAXeM4KqoURYJAF6oMzmEWhFJHjW/4.PNG\" width=\"351\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/Kqu4JOS-VwPoBVE8LXt3f*DUw4EF4INRhRJLz3kIy5Sxi9m2NVRrRz2hkz1DqcY0Uu7eCAXeM4KqoURYJAF6oMzmEWhFJHjW/4.PNG)\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Hou", "created_at": "August 23, 2014 at 10:06pm", "created_by": "DanHou", "topic": "How to add horizental and vertical shade for a glazing with using honeybee?", "id": "topic_1120619"}
