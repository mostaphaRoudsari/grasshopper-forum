{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nOne solution to account for this is to change the properties of your wall in order to account for doors, and other thermal bridges. You can for instance lower the insulation thickness in order to lower the overall U-value of the wall.\n\n\n\nIf you really want to model a door, then I think a good way would be\n\n1- Create your geometry (including the door)\n\n2- Create HB surfaces with their properties\n\n3- Create your zone\n\n\n\nI am not sure this is possible, but maybe you can also add a opaque window to the wall ?\u00a0<br/><br/>Aurelien\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aurelien Keller", "created_at": "February 12, 2017 at 12:19pm", "created_by": "AurelienKeller", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1689972", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1690212"}
