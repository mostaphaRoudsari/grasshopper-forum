{"body": "\nI figured it out! It is definitely on my end so thank you for your prods to get me thinking about this further. Our local-user folders get setup with our username and then the office-server appended to our user-name folder.\n\nSo I have two folders, one that is USERNAME.IG and one that is USERNAME. Ladybug was looking at the latter, just user name, no strange extension. Yet Grasshopper and the components live native in the USERNAME.IG\\AppData\\Roaming\\Grasshopper\n\n\n\nI will definitely talk with my IT department about this and why exactly the .IG is necessary.\n\nWhen I first step the added items under \\ladybug, I figured it made the most sense to place the folder under .IG since grasshopper was in there. When I moved the \\ladybug folder to where it was looking, honeybee is flying free!\n\n\n\nThanks guys!\n\nNeil\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Neil Bulger", "created_at": "December 9, 2014 at 9:36pm", "created_by": "NeilBulger", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184851", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1184505"}
