{"body": "\nMohammed and Elliot,\n\nThis issue is most certainly the result of the MATLAB compiler failing to run correctly on your system and I should put in a better warning for this (rather than missing epw file).\n\nMohammed, in your case this is because the MATLAB runtime compiler version 9.0 is not meant to run on Windows 10 systems. \u00a0I have been talking with the people who currently maintain the UWG and have access to MATLAB. \u00a0They should hopefully add this support soon. \u00a0\n\nElliot, in your case, I still don't know what the issue might be. \u00a0Are you sure that you installed the 64-bit version of the MATLAB Runtime Compiler? \u00a0I might be able to recreate your issue on one of the machines at my office and I will try to do this soon. \u00a0If I can re-create it, I should hopefully be able to fix it or figure out the issue relatively quickly.\n\nAt the latest, both of you will be able to run everything when we finally transition to a python version of the UWG at the end of this summer.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "May 5, 2017 at 5:10pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1745392", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1746388"}
