{"body": "\nHi Mihail,<br/>The error : no light source- is for the interior lights (so it s not for you (now))<br/>and it ending up actuaaly with the result of .ill files, you just need to read them as the daylighting results but instead of LUX you have KWh/M2 or WH/m2,<br/>I added to your definition some \"readers\" where you can go through the whole year every hour, or period of time etc. you just need to read the results from the .ill file :)<br/>and DIVA- so this is actually the same , it uses the same Radiance programs for calcs, and I found HB_LB more powerful than DIVA and easier to visualize the results\u00a0\n\nregards\n\nPeter\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1262292", "name": "Hourlysolar.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Peter Za\u0165ko", "created_at": "April 13, 2015 at 5:02pm", "created_by": "PeterZatko", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262272", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1262291"}
