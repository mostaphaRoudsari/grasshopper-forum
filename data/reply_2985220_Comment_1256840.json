{"body": "\nI'll download the code and try it out this week, but I'm not confident it will make a huge difference. \u00a0Not through any fault of Honeybee, just that the last points file only had 5 more points than the rest of the points files had.\n\nI also did some tests a few months ago about how long it takes to run the simulations based on varying point densities and as you've probably seen, there's not nearly the difference you would expect between how long it takes to calculate for a couple hundred versus a couple thousand points. \u00a0I assumed this is because the calculations occurring in the first step seem to take the majority of the calculation times. I guess at that point it's mostly just simplifying the meshes that radiance uses that would provide the most benefit? \u00a0I guess I'll have to do some tests on that next.\n\nThanks for the update though, I'll download the latest and run the same project file again and post my results\n\n-Tim\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Timothy Logan", "created_at": "April 5, 2015 at 11:31am", "created_by": "TimothyLogan", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256337", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1256840"}
