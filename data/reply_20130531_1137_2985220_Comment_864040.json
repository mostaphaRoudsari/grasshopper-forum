{"body": "\nHi Francesco!\n\nGood to know that it works now. You don't need to download .ddy and .stat files for GenCumulativeSky. The folder also shouldn't cause any problem since the component checks and downloads GenCumulativeSky to workingDir in case it is not already there.\n\nI agree that it is hard to find .epw file (EnergyPlus Weather file) for many locations. There are websites that you can purchase the weather files for many locations and there are software that generate the data. They may be open to share the data for free for educational purposes.\n\nNevertheless EnergyPlus and Radiance or any interface such as DIVA, OpenStudio, etc on top of these engines need some sort of data to calculate the sky condition and the radiation. Honeybee won't be any different!\n\nI'm so bad in predicting the release time so let me not to do that! :) The only thing that I can say is I'm doing my best to release a test version as soon as possible. I've already solved almost all the technical issues but the workflow is not solid enough for a public release.\u00a0Thank you for your interest and your patient. :)\n\nBest,\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "May 31, 2013 at 11:37AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_863174", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_864040"}
