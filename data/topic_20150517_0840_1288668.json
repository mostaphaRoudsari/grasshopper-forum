{"body": "\nhallo Forum,\n\n\n\nI am trying since days but i am still not able to do it. Attached is the gh file. As you can see (after running), the values in the mesh ( lux values) doesn't fit the isoline curves results; and in the isolines curves, when it reach the maximum value , it keeps posting the same value; and the lower values in the curve are not close to the ones in the mesh points.\n\n( i am not able to fix it through average formula or interpolation...i am not sure actually how..)\n\n\n\nWhat i want in the isoline curve is to show values for instance from 100 to 1000 Lux with a step of 100 Lux ( i.e : 100, 200, 300, ..., 1000 ). On the other word, I want the scale to have from 100 to 1000 Lux with a step of 100 Lux.\n\n\n\nany idea?\n\n\n\nThanks for your support!\n\n\n\n\n\nnass.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "nass", "created_at": "May 17, 2015 at 08:40AM", "created_by": "joe88", "topic": "Isoline curve lux values is not similar or close to the mesh values", "id": "topic_1288668"}
