{"body": "\nAaron,\n\nI took a look at your file. \u00a0You had so many solve adjacency components in there that I had a hard time figuring out where the air wall is supposed to be. \u00a0Keep in mind that, every time you use a solve adjacencies component, it will overwrite the previous adjacencies (and constructions of those adjacencies like air walls) unless you set the \"remCurrentAdjc\" input to \"True.\" \u00a0I assumed that these were the zones that you wanted connected with air walls:\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/HwqJujqzkWgW6nkEMGmfXyYQmbbJiEWU122EaP13O*PMy*FZL7ZiLO9pll8qjcx2qUNRG6F-Kz3ceVShPT7-G6ZUn6oS4C9m/AssumedAirWalls.PNG?width=721\" width=\"721\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/HwqJujqzkWgW6nkEMGmfXyYQmbbJiEWU122EaP13O*PMy*FZL7ZiLO9pll8qjcx2qUNRG6F-Kz3ceVShPT7-G6ZUn6oS4C9m/AssumedAirWalls.PNG)\n\nI set up the model to correctly simulate the zones in this fashion. \u00a0There were a number of other errors that I fixed:\n\n1) You did not intersect the building masses before you turned them into zones. \u00a0This means that heat flow acorss the interior surfaces will not be modeled correctly. \u00a0See this video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDvBWDA0aF0&amp;index=10&amp;list=P...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDvBWDA0aF0&amp;index=10&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_))\n\n2) You did not set up your shade/context geometry correctly. \u00a0You must use a conext shading component ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7pN7nWj-4o&amp;index=24&amp;list=P...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7pN7nWj-4o&amp;index=24&amp;list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_)). \u00a0Also, I would highly recommend simplyifying your shade geometry. \u00a0The shade calculations that E+ uses by default are not that detailed so the little gaps between your louvres are not goung to show up.\n\nOn another note, I noticed that these zones are supposed to have different programs but you have assigned them all the same zoneProgram for energy simulation. \u00a0You might want to at least consider distinguishing your apartment and corridor zones. \u00a0I know that it is really long but I would really recommend going through this whole series before trying to set up such a complex model:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8Y...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruLh1AdY-SgW4uDtNSMLeiUmA8YXEHT_)\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1166673", "name": "Multizone_Residence_AirWall_CWM.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 11, 2014 at 10:00PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1166405", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1166672"}
