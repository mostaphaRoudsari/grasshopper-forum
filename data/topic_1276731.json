{"body": "\nHello all.<br/> <br/> I have been following the wonderful tutorials by Chris Mackey, however on I am stuck on the late part of the video 8 - \"Honeybee Energy Modeling - Importing and Visualizing Surface Level Result\".\n\nIts about making radiant temperature map, but it gives some errors such as:\u00a0<br/>\n\n1. The length of data in the comfResultsMTX does not matech the number of faces in the viewFactorMesh.\n\n1. Solution exception:index out of range: -2\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0atGmsdmURSYV2lozumTDo*6zNfy*UaV0z-eh7-xRm2WYZSUY6jV3*va6TXUqzN41sjKGoQ*XAoW3ThMu-Wy0LRj1SRlvIu-/Issue.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0atGmsdmURSYV2lozumTDo*6zNfy*UaV0z-eh7-xRm2WYZSUY6jV3*va6TXUqzN41sjKGoQ*XAoW3ThMu-Wy0LRj1SRlvIu-/Issue.jpg)\n\nIts just simple box building that simulation itself doesn't take long, and I've updated my HB and LB components and everything seems ok. But still having the problem.<br/> <br/> Since the components have major and minor changes I've managed to connect _comfResultsMtx to the read Comfort result component to do the simulation, however it has some other issues as well.\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/0atGmsdmURQ2bzNCrT4s5F8ZUVgz581pj3Fz3*uGaaGoO5BHB*Ox6AyaL*h0Bsm9FX0XrGnXOwXc0DqXX0wFSx*YfpPoFhCW/2.png?width=750\" width=\"750\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/0atGmsdmURQ2bzNCrT4s5F8ZUVgz581pj3Fz3*uGaaGoO5BHB*Ox6AyaL*h0Bsm9FX0XrGnXOwXc0DqXX0wFSx*YfpPoFhCW/2.png)\n\n\n\nThe components error message says\n\n\u00a01. Failed to parse the result file. \u00a0The csv file might not have existed when connected or the simulation did not run correctly.Try reconnecting the _resultfileAddress to this component or re-running your simulation.\n\n\n\nSo the question is how to achieve\u00a0radiant temperature map? and could it be done in specific analysis period instead of annual cycle?\n\n\n\nBest Regards.<br/> Awkweird.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1276730", "name": "Honeybee issue.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Amaraa", "created_at": "April 29, 2015 at 11:07am", "created_by": "Amartuvshin", "topic": "Issue related to the Honeybee_Visualize Annual Comfort Result (VisualizeComfort)", "id": "topic_1276731"}
