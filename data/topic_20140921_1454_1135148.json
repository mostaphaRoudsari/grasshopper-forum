{"body": "\nDear expert,\n\nI have tried to create a simple building with variable orientation and variable glazing ratio in order to show the effect of this variables on internal illuminace.<br/>To do this I have already a geometry that I have converted in a HBsurfaces, then in one of this surfaces I have added a window with variable glazing ratio. <br/>Although the simulation run with reliable results (illuminance decrease with the glazing ratio at fixed orientation) I am not sure that it is the right way to do this,<br/> in fact I am not able to change the window characteristic, and if I try to separate the window from the wall with decomposeByType component it isn't works. <br/> <br/>So, how I can separate the window from the HBsurface as shown in the 004_HB example?\n\n<br/>Cheers,<br/>Giuseppe\n\nPS: Maybe the problem is more clear if you check in the attachment the .gh file.\n", "attachments": [{"link": "http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/attachment/download?id=2985220%3AUploadedFile%3A1135147", "name": "luna_01.gh"}], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "September 21, 2014 at 02:54PM", "created_by": "GiuseppeDM", "topic": "Glazing ratio on HBsurface", "id": "topic_1135148"}
