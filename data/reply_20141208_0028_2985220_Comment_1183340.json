{"body": "\nI think a report for success is helpful in terms of learning what the components are doing, because the HBSurface output doesn't seem to give all the information of what is being done by the component. In grasshopper your trained to ask yourself \"ok, what did I put into this component, and now, what am I getting out of it.\" In this case... I'm only able to read geometry, without seeing the materials assigned... or anything else. Is the intention of the readme! output to replace the baloon on native components?\n\nSo, second question, why am I not allowed to lable geometry the same material name in different createHBSrf components? In terms of what you expect from grasshopper, I'm shoving a bunch of different geometry into the component and giving it all the same material, why is there no conflict there? My grasshopper instinct would lead me to believe that a duplicate component is doing duplicate actions, and if I just add it to the same data tree downstream, it should all be fine. Does it create some sort of group when assigned materials in the createHBSrf, and it can't be given the same attributes as another group... or something along those lines? Anyway... through me for a loop.\n\nAnother question. I've been evaluating the model in section, like you see above, and when the srf is facing one direction, produces different results than when it is facing the other direction. The surface itself is not part of the daylight model, so it shouldn't be shading anything, do the sample points sample in a particular direction? I would assume it would have been sampling for light spherically.\u00a0\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "will krzymowski", "created_at": "December 08, 2014 at 12:28AM", "created_by": "willkrzymowski", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1182347", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1183340"}
