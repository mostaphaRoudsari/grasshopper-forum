{"body": "\nAbraham,\n\nThis is great and thank you for doing the homework :). \u00a0At least now we know now that the issue seems to be with the natural ventilation since the other terms are looking really similar. \u00a0The storage term is just computed as the remainder of the other terms (to make the energy balanced) so it is really only reflecting the difference in the natural ventilation between the two simulations.\n\nLet me see if I can re-create this difference on a small scale and, hopefully, this will then fix your issue.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 16, 2016 at 11:20am", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1614971", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1619466"}
