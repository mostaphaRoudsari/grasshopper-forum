{"body": "\nHi Mathias,\n\n\n\nSorry for the late response. \u00a0I am not sure what you are asking here. \u00a0If you plug in lists of equal value without any LB Headers, the UTCI component should do exactly what you are talking about. \u00a0There's no need to graft unless you are trying to run lists of lists (instead of just one list).\n\n\n\nBecause the calculation of UTCI is so fast (it's just a polynomial equation), it isn't worth it to run individual calculations of UTCI in parallel. \u00a0In other words, it takes more computational power to figure out how to divide the task between threads than to compute a single UTCI value. \u00a0However, if you have a whole spatial set of UTCI points and you want to run them for several hours of the year, it can often make sense to run each hour on it's own core. \u00a0This is effectively with the UTCI microclimate maps do here:\n\n[http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;for...](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&amp;fork=hydra_2&amp;id=Trees_in_Outdoor_Thermal_Comfort&amp;slide=0&amp;scale=1.319507910772895&amp;offset=-297.3990467297342,-101.89461237074937)\n\n\n\nGlad to hear that you like the PerformanceNetwork talks and, yes, I was not too electronic-savy when I picked out my current headset.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "October 29, 2016 at 09:03PM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1627293", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1628901"}
