{"body": "\nHesham,\n\nThis is something that is currently under development and should be complete by the next stable release:\n\n[https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/104](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/ladybug/issues/104)\n\nThe BakeIt options will be fully functional (with no meshes and only text, curves, and hatches) and will support a workflow that exports the graphics to vector-based formats like PDFs and Illustrator. \u00a0\n\nWe have to use meshes for text now because of some limitations in the Rhinocommon SDK and, had we not needed to do so many work-arounds to get dynamically interactive text, this all probably would have been done a lot sooner.\n\nI will post here once I put in the fully functional BakeIt option on the psych chart.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "November 27, 2015 at 10:06pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1410264", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1411226"}
