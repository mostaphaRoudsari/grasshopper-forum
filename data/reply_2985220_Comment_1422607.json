{"body": "\nDuncan,\n\nI see that the peak cooling in two cases of U-values are differing by only a very small amount (&lt;1W out of over 300W) and this is more like a rounding error than an actual decrease in peak cooling. \u00a0This result makes a lot of sense to me when you consider all of the factors that contribute to your EnergyPlus peak cooling and is something that I have witnessed in some simulations of my own over the past couple of years.\n\nThe reason why the peak cooling is not deeply affected by the changing U-Value is that having a high U-Value can actually be a benefit in hot times of the year as it can assist in the shedding of heat in the night before a hot day and the cooling down of the buildings surfaces. \u00a0This is particularly important in your model where the nighttime setback is 30C, which is much warmer than the nighttime outdoor temperature and means that you certainly are getting more heat loss at night with a higher window U-value. \u00a0Contrarily, the day (especially in a south glazed building like the one you are testing) is driven mostly by solar load and (especially for retail)\u00a0internal gain. \u00a0Whatever heat gain you may be getting through window conduction with a higher U-value is very small in comparison to these other heat sources and is understandably counter-acted by the coolness of building's thermal mass from the previous night (and it's ability to absorb the heat of these other intense sources).\n\nI third the statement that, if you really want to see a major reduction in peak cooling, the SHGC is the term that you should be adjusting.\n\n-Chris\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "December 16, 2015 at 10:01pm", "created_by": "ChrisMackey", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1422575", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1422607"}
