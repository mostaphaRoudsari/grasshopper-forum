{"body": "\nHi Chris,<br/><br/>Thank you for the upload. You do not have to check on other Windows versions. The upper error\u00a0[you posted](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/xn/detail/2985220:Comment:1557854) was caused by not following the **step 3** of the installation: You should have copied the content from the **\"bin\"** folder to the **\"c:\\ladybug\\terrain shading mask libraries 64-bit\"** folder:\n\n\n\n[<img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/ys89Oj1AWQ*2TTTaXHwQcflhS9Cleq7Tl-VZuJjCTcLmIVRQEBT5ogV0wEm25iMsLTdwg10aua0LnjPNQRFOZidO13E3kTBw/Chris_terrainShadingMask_step3.jpg?width=700\" width=\"700\"/>](http://api.ning.com:80/files/ys89Oj1AWQ*2TTTaXHwQcflhS9Cleq7Tl-VZuJjCTcLmIVRQEBT5ogV0wEm25iMsLTdwg10aua0LnjPNQRFOZidO13E3kTBw/Chris_terrainShadingMask_step3.jpg)\n\nSo not the very **bin** folder, but its content.<br/>Just do this and the component will work.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<br/>Hi Abraham,\n\n\n\nBut just want to remind that Marios Tsiliakos developed a component for unblocking the LB_HB components and libraries (Unblock All and Unblock).\n\nThank you for the suggestion. I am aware of that component. I shared\u00a0[an article about it](https://digitalsubstance.wordpress.com/2015/08/17/unblocking-gh-add-ons-more-a-k-a-why-the-add-on-is-not-installed) on my facebook account last year, at the time when it was released. It's a great component!<br/>There are still two issues with it: It edits the windows registry.<br/>I order for it to edit the windows registry it requires an account with administrator's rights.<br/>To unblock the file manually you do not need to have an account with administrator's rights.\n\n<br/>BTW i installed the release-1800-x64-gdal-2-1-0-mapserver-7-0-1.zip without issues (just unblocking).\n\nYes, the **GDAL 2.x.x and MapServer 7.x.x**\u00a0 versions will also work. But I can not install them on my PC, therefor I can not provide support for them. **The GDAL 1.x.x and MapServer 6.x.x** are sufficient for what the component does.<br/>If you intend to seek support for any future issues, please install the latest\u00a0**GDAL 1.x.x and MapServer 6.x.x** version as said by the component installation instructions.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "djordje", "created_at": "July 04, 2016 at 06:30AM", "created_by": "djordje", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559820", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1559779"}
