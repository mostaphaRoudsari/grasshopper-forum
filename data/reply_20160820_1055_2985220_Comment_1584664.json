{"body": "Carmelo,\n\nAir walls of all varieties (ie horizontal, vertical, diagonal) are supported.\n\nCould you clarify what you man by \"after the simulation?\" If you man that you use the \"Import IDF\" component, the reason why air walls are not recognized is probably because EnergyPlus actually doesn't have air walls. In other words, the concept of air walls does not come from the creators of EnergyPlus but rather practitioners who needed to separate a space into two or more zones. Practitioners thus define air walls by a material with the conductivity of an air film and an extra energyplus object that mixes the air between zones. For this reason, the import IDF might not immediately recognize the surfaces as air walls because E+ has not strict definition of them.\n\nIf you are not referring to the importIDF component then you are not assigning the air walls correctly. Please upload the file and we can see what the issue is.\n\n-Chris", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Mackey", "created_at": "August 20, 2016 at 10:55AM", "created_by": "chris", "parent_id": "topic_1584661", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1584664"}
