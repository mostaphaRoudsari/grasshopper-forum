{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThankyou, I am going to try the .csv from the link you sent.\n\nMy research is on understanding how inhabitants interact with building and its element (The topic name is \u201cLightweight look ahead options: An eco-dialect between building, its inhabitants and designers\u201d). \u00a0And how their interaction affects the energy use in the buildings. I am building an interactive interface (html/d3.js) that allows the inhabitants to choose their actions in any given instance that affects their comfort. \u00a0I am using lady/bug honeybee to run the simulation on the backend. In the process of their choice the inhabitant is able to see visual data on how their action affects their comfort in time. May be the study might reveal model of inhabitants interaction. I have explored different tools but I find ladybug/honeybee meets most of the requirements I need for modelling. I will send more details through email.\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vinu Subashini", "created_at": "April 28, 2015 at 12:41PM", "created_by": "VinuSubashini", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1275236", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1275468"}
