{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nIf I use Honeybee transparent material to make a prism. Do you think that Honeybee can understand the properties of the prism? so it can give me the spectrum light dispersed from the prism if I point direct sunlight on it.\n\n\n\nOr there is another plugin for that sake?\n\n\n\nI can get spectrum light from the prism using V-Ray in 3D Max, but I need to use Grasshopper to control more parameters.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThank you..\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ahmad Eltaweel", "created_at": "May 17, 2017 at 4:38am", "created_by": "AhmadEltaweel", "topic": "Inquiry about Honeybee transparent material.", "id": "topic_1752950"}
