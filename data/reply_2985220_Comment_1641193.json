{"body": "\nHi Bi and Devang,\n\nI haven't checked the model but generally speaking using intersection and split in optimization studies can make Grasshopper to crash. Intersection can change based on the tolerance values. If you can set up a higher tolerance that works with your model that should help avoiding the crash. If your model is simple enough then I suggest to develop your own code to create the geometry and use Honeybee to create the zones and run the analysis.\n\nAlso in some cases it has been an issue with the memory. I have recently made major modification to Honeybee to address the memory issue. If you update to the version available on GitHub you can test it with the new version.\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "November 17, 2016 at 6:19am", "created_by": "MostaphaSadeghipour", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1641066", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1641193"}
