In the\u00a0International System of Units, the symbol for the temperature in degree Celsius is \u00b0C and not simply C. I think it could be useful to add the parenthesis each time you add the unit of measurement (I prefer the square brackets but the round brackets are used too) both in the header and legend. Now, if I use the LBHeader and I define the unit, for example [\u00b0C], in the header I found something like this: ([\u00b0C]). If I exclude the square brackets and then in the unit I input only \u00b0C, in the upper limit of the legend I find \u00b0C and not (\u00b0C). So I think It would better to standardize the visualization of the u.m. in the graph with all the parenthesis (preferably square brackets).\n\n\n\nF.\n\n\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco", "created_at": "September 06, 2017 at 04:01AM", "created_by": "Francesco661", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1797473", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1809375"}
