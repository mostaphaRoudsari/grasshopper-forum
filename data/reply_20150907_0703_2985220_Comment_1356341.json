{"body": "\nHi Fahimeh.\n\nI checked your file and I'm confused what you're trying to do. Are your goal is only to model a room and optimize it for daylight or is it going to be also an energy model at some point? Is the size of the room stays the same during the whole study?\n\nIn any case you need to model light-shelves as separate surfaces and not part of the zone.\n\n\n\nAlso there is also so many extra components in your definition. I would only leave the components which are critical to the study for an optimization case as you need to run so many cases.\n\n\n\nLet me know what are you exactly trying to do and we'll look for alternate solutions.\n\n\n\nMostapha\n", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari", "created_at": "September 07, 2015 at 07:03AM", "created_by": "mostapha", "parent_id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1355760", "id": "reply_2985220_Comment_1356341"}
